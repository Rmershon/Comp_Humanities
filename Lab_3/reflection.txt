\f0\fs24 \cf0 Poem:\
\
Paul Revere\'92s Ride. \
\
The selection is interesting because it details the famous ride of Paul Revere during the American revolution. I think its an important piece of American history, and that\'92s why this piece is interesting to me. \
This poem seems to be around a 5th grade reading level. Its not super basic but has some more complex words. \
I think that this selection is a very positive sentiment. It\'92s a positive message as a call to arms for the people of early America. \
What are the most commonly used words at the time of the writing of this poem? And how do they compare to the common words in the poem?\
\
Book:\
\
Alice\'92s Adventures in Wonderland.\
\
Alice\'92s Adventures in Wonderland is a classic child story.  It\'92s just something that many people have interacted with as children, and was a part of my childhood. \
I think that this book is around the same level as my poem. Around a 5th grade reading level. There are complex topics but the words are not overly complex. \
When we step back from the book, this is a dark or negative sentiment. \
How does the sentiment of each section of the book change as the story progresses? Are there more negative or more positive sections?\
\
Image:\
\
The image is of the horse head nebula. Space is a really intriguing subject to me and this image was the background on my laptop for a long time. \
I think that this sentiment is very neutral. Its neither a positive or negative image. Although some may perceive it as positive or negative as they like or dislike space. \
How similar is this naturally created piece to that of some classical art?\
\
\
Instrumental Music:\
\
(Anesthesia) Pulling Teeth. \
\
(Anesthesia) Pulling Teeth is a song by Metalica. This song is important to me because I learned how to play it several years ago. To me it is a super complex piece and the musician playing it is very talented. \
If I had to pick some kind of sentiment it would be negative. This piece is very intense and dark. \
I want to see if there are any patterns that exist between the beginning and the end of the song. As they become two very different pieces. Almost as if there are two songs put together. What similarities does this piece have between its beginning and ending?}
