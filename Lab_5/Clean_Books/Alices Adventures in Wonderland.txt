april july 1917  preface to the  eightysixth thousand enquiries have been so often addressed to me as to whether any answer to the hatters riddle see p 97 can be imagined that i may as well put on record here what seems to me to be a fairly appropriate answer viz  because it can produce a few notes though they are very flat  and it is never put with the wrong end in front   this however is merely an afterthought  the riddle as originally invented had no answer at all for this eightysixth thousand fresh electrotypes have been taken from the woodblocks which never having been used for printing from are in as good condition as when first cut in 1865 and the whole book has been set up afresh with new type if the artistic qualities of this reissue fall short in any particular of those possessed by the original issue it will not be for want of painstaking on the part of author publisher or printer i take this opportunity of announcing that the nursery  alice hitherto priced at four shillings net is now to be had on the same terms as the ordinary shilling picturebooksalthough i feel sure that it is in every quality except the text itself on which i am not qualified to pronounce greatly superior to them four shillings was a perfectly reasonable price to charge considering the very heavy initial outlay i had incurred  still as the public have practically said  we will not give more than a shilling for a picturebook however artistically gotup i am content to reckon my outlay on the book as so much dead loss and rather than let the little ones for whom it was written go without it i am selling it at a price which is to me much the same thing as giving it away christmas 1896  all in the golden afternoon full leisurely we glide  for both our oars with little skill by

 chapter i down the rabbit hole  alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank and of having nothing to do  once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading but it had no pictures or conversations in it  and what is is  b  2  down the  the use of a book thought alice  without pictures or conversations   so she was considering in her own mind as well as she could for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid whether the pleasure of making a daisychain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies when suddenly a white rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her there was nothing so very remarkable in that  nor did alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the rabbit say to itself  oh dear  oh dear  i shall be too late   when she thought it over afterwards it oc curred to her that she ought to have wondered at this but at the time it all seemed quite natural  but when the rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoatpocket and looked at it and then hurried on alice started to her feet for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waist coatpocket or a watch to take out of it and  rabbithole  3  burning with curiosity she ran across the field after it and was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbithole under the hedge in another moment down went alice after it never once considering how in the world she was to get out again the rabbithole went straight on like a tunnel for some way and then dipped suddenly down so suddenly that alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down what seemed to be a very deep well either the well was very deep or she fell very slowly for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next first she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to but it was too dark to see anything  then she looked at the sides of the well and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and bookshelves  here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs she took down b 2  4  down the  a jar from one of the shelves as she passed  it was labeled  orange marmalade but  to her great disappointment it was empty  she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody underneath so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it well thought alice to herself  after  such a fall as this i shall think nothing of tumbling downstairs  think me at home   how brave they ll all why i wouldnt say any  thing about it even if i fell off the top of the house    which was very likely true  down down down come to an end   would the fall never  i wonder how many miles  i ve fallen by this time   she said aloud  i  must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth  let me see  that would be four  thousand miles down i think for you see alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom and though this was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge as there was no one to listen to  rabbithole  5  her still it was good practice to say it over  yes that s about the right distancebut then i wonder what latitude or longitude ive got to    alice had not the slightest idea what  latitude  was  or longitude  either  but she  thought they were nice grand words to say presently she began again   i wonder if  i shall fall right through the earth   how funny  itll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downwards   the anti  pathies i think she was rather glad there was no one listening this time as it didnt sound at all the right word but i shall have to ask them what the name of the country is you  know  please  maam  is  this  new  zealand  or australia   and she tried to curtsey as she spokefancy curtseying as you re falling through the air  manage it   do you think   and what an ignorant little girl  she ll think me for asking  to ask   perhaps  somewhere  you could  i  no it ll never do  shall see  it written  up  6  down the  down down down there was nothing else to do so alice soon began talking again  dinah ll miss me very much tonight i should think   dinah was the cat i hope theyll remember her saucer of milk at teatime dinah my dear  i wish you were down here with me  there are no mice in the air im afraid but you might catch a bat and that s very like a mouse you know but do cats eat bats i wonder   and here alice began to get rather sleepy and went on saying to herself in a dreamy sort of way  do cats eat bats  do cats eat bats   and sometimes  do bats eat cats   for you see as she couldnt answer either question it didnt much matter which way she put it she felt that she was dozing off and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with dinah and was saying to her very earnestly  now dinah tell me the truth  did you ever eat a bat   when suddenly thump  thump  down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves and the fall was over  rabbithole  1  alice was not a bit hurt and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment  she looked up but it was all dark overhead  before her was another long passage and the white rabbit was still in sight hurrying down it there was not a moment to be lost  away went alice like the wind and was just in time to hear it say as it turned a corner  oh my ears and whiskers how late it s getting   she was close behind it when she turned the corner but the rabbit was no longer to be seen  she found herself in a long low hall which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof there were doors all round the hall but they were all locked  and when alice had been all the way down one side and up the other trying every door she walked sadly down the middle wondering how she was ever to get out again suddenly she came upon a little threelegged table all made of solid glass  there was nothing on it but a tiny golden key and alices first idea was that this might belong to one of the  down the  doors of the hall  but alas  either the locks were too large or the key was too small but at any rate it would not open any of them however on the second time round she came upon  a  low  curtain she had not noticed be fore and be hind a  it  was  little  door  about  fifteen  inches  high   she tried the little key  golden in  the  lock and to her great delight it fitted  alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage not much larger than a rathole  she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw how she longed to get out of that dark hall and wander about among those beds of bright  rabbithole  9  flowers and those cool fountains but she could not even get her head through the doorway  and even if my head  would go through  thought poor alice  it would be of very little use without my shoulders oh how i wish i could shut up like a telescope  i think i could if i only knew how to begin  for you see so  many outoftheway things had happened lately that alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible there seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door so she went back to the table half hoping she might find another key on it or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes  this time she found a little bottle on it  which certainly was not here before said alice and tied round the neck of the bottle was a paper label with the words  drink me  beautifully printed on it in large letters it was all very well to say  drink me but the wise little alice was not going to do that  10  down the  in a hurry see   no ill look first she said  and  whether  it s  marked poison or not   for she had read  several  nice  little stories about children  who  had  got burnt and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things all because they would not re member the simple    rules their friends had taught them  such as that a redhot poker will burn you if you hold it too long  and that if you cut your finger very deeply with a knife it usually bleeds  and she had never forgotten that if you drink much from a bottle marked  poison it is almost certain to disagree with you sooner or later however this bottle was not marked  poison  rabbithole  11  so alice ventured to taste it and finding it very nice it had in fact a sort of mixed flavour of cherrytart custard pineapple roast turkey toffy and hot buttered toast she very soon finished it off   what a curious feeling   said alice  i must be shutting up like a telescope   and so it was indeed  she was now only ten inches high and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden first however she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further  she felt a little nervous about this   for it might end you know said alice to herself  in my going out altogether like a candle i wonder what i should be like then   and she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle looks like after the candle is blown out  12  down the  for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing after a while finding that nothing more happened she decided on going into the garden at once  but alas for poor alice  when she got to the door she found she had forgotten the little golden key and when she went back to the table for it she found she could not possibly reach it  she could see it quite plainly through the glass and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table but it was too slippery  and when she had tired herself out with trying the poor little thing sat down and cried  come theres no use in crying like that   said alice to herself rather sharply  i advise you to leave off this minute   she generally gave herself very good advice though she very seldom followed it and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself  rabbithole  13  in a game of croquet she was playing against herself for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people  but it s no use now thought poor alice  to pretend to be two people  why there s hardly enough of me left to make one respectable person   soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table  she opened it and found in it a very small cake on which the words eat me were beautifully marked in currants  well i ll eat it said alice  and if it makes me grow larger i can reach the key  and if it makes me grow smaller i can creep under the door  so either way i ll get into the garden and i dont care which happens   she ate a little bit and said anxiously to herself  which way  which way   holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing  and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size to be sure this is what generally happens when one eats cake  but alice had got so much into the  y  14  down the rabbithole  way of expecting  nothing  but outoftheway  things to happen that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way so she set to work and very soon finished off the cake  chapter ii the pool  of tears   curiouser and curiouser   cried alice she was so much sur prised that for the moment she quite for got how to speak good english  now i m opening out like the largest telescope that ever was  goodbye feet   for when she looked down at her feet they seemed to be almost out of sight they were getting so far off oh my poor little feet i wonder  16  the pool  who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now dears  i m sure i shant be able  i shall be a great deal too far off to trouble my self about you  you must manage the best way you canbut i must be kind to them thought alice  or perhaps they wont walk the way i want to go  let me see ill give them a new pair of boots every christmas and she went on planning to herself how she would manage it  they must go by the carrier she thought   and how funny it ll seem sending presents to ones own feet  and how odd the directions will look  alices right foot esq hearthrug near the fender with alices love  oh dear what nonsense i m talking   just at this moment her head struck against the roof of the hall  in fact she was now rather more than nine feet high and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door  of tears  17  poor alice  it was as much as she could do lying down on one side to look through into the garden with one eye  but to get through was more hopeless than ever  she sat down and began to cry again you ought to be ashamed of yourself said alice a great girl like you she might well say this to go on crying in this way  stop this moment i tell you   but she went on all the same shedding gallons of tears until there was a large pool all round her about four inches deep and reaching half down the hall after a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming it was the white rabbit returning splendidly dressed with a pair of white kidgloves in one hand and a large fan in the other  he came trotting along in a great hurry muttering to himself as he came  oh  the duchess the duchess  oh  wont she be savage if i ve kept her waiting   alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help  18  the pool  of any one  so when the rabbit came near her she began in a low timid voice  if you please sir  the rabbit started violently dropped the white kidgloves and the fan and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go  of tears  19  alice took up the fan and gloves and as the hall was very hot she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking  dear dear  how queer everything is today  and yester day things went on just as usual i wonder if i ve been changed in the night  let me think  was i the same when i got up this morning i almost think i can remember feeling a little different but if i m not the same the next question is  who in the world am i   ah thats the great puzzle   and she began thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself to see if she could have been changed for any of them im sure im not ada she said for her hair goes in such long ringlets and mine doesnt go in ringlets at all  and i m sure i cant be mabel for i know all sorts of things and she oh she knows such a very little  besides she s she and im i andoh dear how puzzling it all is  ill try if i know all the things i used to know let me see  four times five is twelve c 2  20  the pool  and four times six is thirteen and four times seven isoh dear  at that rate   i shall never get to twenty  however the multiplicationtable  doesnt signify  let s try geography  london is  the capital of paris and paris is the capital of rome and romeno thats all wrong im certain  i must have been changed for mabel  i ll try and say hoiv doth the little  and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons and began to repeat it but her voice sounded hoarse and strange and the words did not come the same as they used to do   how doth the little crocodile improve his shining tail and pour the waters of the nile on every golden scale  how cheerfully he seems to grin how neatly spreads his claws and welcomes little fishes in with gently smiling jaws i   of tears  21   i m sure those are not the right words said poor alice and her eyes filled with tears again as she went on  i must be mabel after all and i shall have to go and live in that poky little house and have next to no toys to play with and oh ever so many lessons to learn  no i ve made up my mind about it  if i m mabel 1 1l stay down here  it ll be no use their putting their heads down and saying  come up again dear   i shall only look up and say  who am i then  tell me that first and then if i like being that person i ll come up  if not i ll stay down here till i m some body else but oh dear   cried alice with a sudden burst of tears i do wish they would put their heads down  i am so very tired of being all alone here   as she said this she looked down at her hands and was surprised to see that she had put on one of the rabbits little white kidgloves while she was talking  how can i have done that   she thought  i must be growing small  22  the pool  again she got up and went to the table to measure herself by it and found that as nearly as she could guess she was now about two feet high and was going on shrinking rapidly  she soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding and she dropped it hastily just in time to save herself from shrinking away altogether  that was a narrow escape   said alice a good deal frightened at the sudden change but very glad to find herself still in existence  and now for the garden   and she ran with all speed back to the little door  but alas  the little door was shut again and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as before  and things are worse than ever thought the poor child for i never was so small as this before never  and i declare it s too bad that it is   as she said these words her foot slipped and in another moment splash  she was up to her chin in saltwater her first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea  and in  of tears  23  that case i can go back by railway she said to herself alice had been to the seaside once in her life and had come to the general con clusion that wherever you go to on the english coast you find a number of bathingmachines in the sea some children digging in the sand with wooden spades then a row of lodginghouses and behind them a railwaystation however she soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high  i wish i hadnt cried so much   said alice as she swam about trying to find her way out  24  the pool   i shall be punished for it now i suppose by being drowned in my own tears  that will be a queer thing to be sure  however everything is queer today just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off and she swam nearer to make out what it was  at first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus but then she remembered how small she was now and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself  would it be of any use now thought alice  to speak to this mouse  everything is so outoftheway down here that i should think very likely it can talk  at any rate there s no harm in trying so she began   o mouse do you know the way out of this pool  i am very tired of swimming about here o mouse   alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse  she had never done such a thing before but she remembered having seen in her brothers latin grammar  a mouse  of tears  26  of a mouseto a mousea mouseo mouse   the mouse looked at her rather inquisitively and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes but it said nothing  perhaps it doesnt understand english thought alice  i daresay it s a french mouse come over with william the conqueror for with all her knowledge of history alice had no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened so she began again  o est ma chatte   which was the first sentence in her french lessonbook the mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water and seemed to quiver all over with fright  oh i beg your pardon   cried alice hastily afraid that she had hurt the poor animals feelings  i quite forgot you didnt like cats  not like cats   cried the mouse in a shrill passionate voice would you like cats if you were me    well perhaps not said alice in a sooth ing tone   dont be angry about it and yet  the pool  i wish i could show you our cat dinah i think you d take a fancy to cats if you could only see her she is such a dear quiet thing alice went on half to herself as she swam lazily  307ti  about in the pool  and she sits purring so nicely by the fire licking her paws and wash ing her face and she is such a nice soft thing to nurseand shes such a capital one for catch ing mice oh i beg your pardon   cried alice again for this time the mouse was bristling all over and she felt certain it must be really  of tears  27  offended  we wont talk about her any more if youd rather not  we indeed   cried the mouse who was trembling down to the end of its tail  as if i would talk on such a subject  our family always hated cats  nasty low vulgar things  dont let me hear the name again    i wont indeed   said alice in a great hurry to change the subject of conversation  are youare you fondofof dogs   the mouse did not answer so alice went on eagerly   there is such a nice little dog near our house i should like to show you  a little brighteyed terrier you know with oh such long curly brown hair  and it ll fetch things when you throw them and it ll sit up and beg for its dinner and all sorts of thingsi cant re member half of themand it belongs to a farmer you know and he says its so useful it s worth a hundred pounds  he says it kills all the rats andoh dear   cried alice in a sorrowful tone  i m afraid i ve offended it    28  the pool of tears  again   for the mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went so she called softly after it  mouse dear  do come back again and we wont talk about cats or dogs either if you dont like them   when the mouse heard this it turned round and swam slowly back to her  its face was quite pale with passion alice thought and it said in a low trembling voice  let us get to the shore and then ill tell you my history and you ll understand why it is i hate cats and dogs it was high time to go for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and ani mals that had fallen into it  there was a duck and a dodo a lory and an eaglet and several other curious creatures alice led the way and the whole party swam to the shore  chapter iii a caucusrace and a long tale  they were indeed a queerlooking party that assembled on the bankthe birds with draggled feathers the animals with their fur clinging close to them and all dripping wet cross and un comfortable the first question of course was how to get dry again  they had a consultation about this  so  a caucusrace  and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural to alice to find herself talking familiarly with them as if she had known them all her life indeed she had quite a long argument with the lory who at last turned sulky and would only say  i m older than you and must know better and this alice would not allow with out knowing how old it was and as the lory positively refused to tell its age there was no more to be said at last the mouse who seemed to be a person of some authority among them called out  sit down all of you and listen to me  ill soon make you dry enough   they all sat down at once in a large ring with the mouse in the middle alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon  ahem   said the mouse with an important air  are you all ready  this is the driest thing i know silence all round if you please   william the conqueror whose cause was  and a long tale  31  favoured by the pope was soon submitted to by the english who wanted leaders and had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest edwin and morcar the earls of mercia and northumbria   ugh   said the lory with a shiver  i beg your pardon   said the mouse frowning but very politely  did you speak    not i   said the lory hastily i thought you did said the mouse i proceed  edwin and morcar the earls of mercia and northumbria declared for him  and even stigand the patriotic archbishop of canterbury found it advisable  found what said the duck  found it  the mouse replied rather crossly  of course you know what it means  i know what  it  means well enough when i find a thing said the duck   it s generally a frog or a worm the question is what did the archbishop find   the mouse did not notice this question but  32  a caucusrace  hurriedly went on  found it advisable to go with edgar atheling to meet william and offer him the crown williams conduct at first was moderate but the insolence of his normans  how are you getting on now my dear   it con tinued turning to alice as it spoke  as wet as ever said alice in a melancholy tone   it doesnt seem to dry me at all  in that case said the dodo solemnly rising to its feet  i move that the meeting adjourn for the immediate adoption of more energetic remedies   speak english   said the eaglet  i dont know the meaning of half those long words and what s more i dont believe you do either   and the eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile  some of the other birds tittered audibly  what i was going to say said the dodo in an offended tone was that the best thing to get us dry would be a caucusrace  what is a caucusrace   said alice  not that she much wanted to know but the dodo  and a long tale  33  had paused as if it thought that somebody ought to speak and no one else seemed inclined to say anything  why said the dodo  the best way to explain it is to do it and as you might like to try the thing yourself some winterday i will tell you how the dodo managed it first it marked out a racecourse in a sort of circle  the exact shape doesnt matter it said and then all the party were placed along the course here and there there was no  one two three and away   but they began running when they liked and left off when they liked so that it was not easy to know when the race was over however when they had been running half an hour or so and were quite dry again the dodo suddenly called out  the race is over   and they all crowded round it panting and asking  but who has won   this question the dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought and it stood for a long time with one finger pressed upon its v  84  a catjousrace  forehead the position in which you usually see shakespeare in the pictures of him while the rest waited in silence at last the dodo said  everybody has won and all must have prizes  but who is to give the prizes   quite a chorus of voices asked  why she of course said the dodo point ing to alice with one finger  and the whole party at once crowded round her calling out in a confused way  prizes  prizes   alice had no idea what to do and in despair she put her hand in her pocket and pulled out a box of comfits luckily the salt water had not got into it and handed them round as prizes there was exactly one apiece all round  but she must have a prize herself you know said the mouse of course the dodo replied very gravely  what else have you got in your pocket   it went on turning to alice  only a thimble said alice sadly  hand it over here said the dodo  and a long tale  36  then they all crowded round her once more while the dodo solemnly presented the thimbl e saying  we beg your acceptance of this elegant thimble   and when it had finished this short speech they all cheered d 2  36  a caucuskace  alice thought the whole thing very absurd but they all looked so grave that she did not dare to laugh  and as she could not think of anything to say she simply bowed and took the thimble looking as solemn as she could the next thing was to eat the comfits  this caused some noise and confusion as the large birds complained that they could not taste theirs and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back however it was over at last and they sat down again in a ring and begged the mouse to tell them something more  you promised to tell me your history you know said alice  and why it is you hatec and d she added in a whisper half afraid that it would be offended again  mine is a long and a sad tale   said the mouse turning to alice and sighing  it is a long tail certainly said alice looking down with wonder at the mouses tail   but why do you call it sad   and she kept on puzzling about it while the mouse was speaking  and a long tale  37  so that her idea of the tale was something like this   fury said to a mouse that he met in the house let us both go to law   will prose cute you come ill take no de nial we must have the trial  for really this morn ing ive nothing to do said the mouse to the cur  such a trial dear sir with no jury or judge would be wast ing our breath ill be judge be jury said cun ning old fury try the  38  a caucusrace   you are not attending   said the mouse to alice severely  what are you thinking of  i beg your pardon said alice very humbly   you had got to the fifth bend i think    i had not   cried the mouse sharply and very angrily  a knot   said alice always ready to make herself useful and looking anxiously about her  oh do let me help to undo it    i shall do nothing of the sort said the mouse getting up and walking away  you insult me by talking such nonsense    i didnt mean it   pleaded poor alice  but you re so easily offended you know   the mouse only growled in reply  please come back and finish your story   alice called after it and the others all joined in chorus  yes please do   but the mouse only shook its head impatiently and walked a little quicker  what a pity it wouldnt stay   sighed the lory as soon as it was quite out of sight  and a long tale  39  and an old crab took the opportunity of saying to her daughter  ah my dear   let this be  a lesson to you never to lose your temper    hold your tongue ma   said the young crab a little snappishly  youre enough to try the  patience of an oyster    i wish i had our dinah here i know i do   said alice aloud particular  addressing nobody in   she d soon fetch it back    and who is dinah if i might venture to ask the question   said the lory alice replied  eagerly  ready to talk about cat  for she was always  her pet   dinah s our  and shes such a capital one for catching  mice you cant think   and oh i wish you  could see her after the birds   why she ll eat  a little bird as soon as look at it   this speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party  some of the birds hurried  off at once  one old magpie began wrapping itself up very carefully remarking  i really must be  getting home  the nightair doesnt  40  a caucusrace and a long tale  suit my throat   and a canary called out in a trembling voice to its children  come away my dears  it s high time you were all in bed   on various pretexts they all moved off and alice was soon left alone  i wish i hadnt mentioned dinah   she said to herself in a melancholy tone  nobody seems to like her down here and i m sure she s the best cat in the world  oh my dear dinah  i wonder if i shall ever see you any more   and here poor alice began to cry again for she felt very lonely and lowspirited in a little while however she again heard a little patter ing of footsteps in the distance and she looked up eagerly half hoping that the mouse had changed his mind and was coming back to finish his story  chapter iv the rabbit sends in a little bill  it was the white rabbit trotting slowly back again and looking anxiously about as it went as if it had lost something  and she heard it muttering to itself  the duchess  the duchess  oh my dear paws  oh my fur and whiskers  she ll get me executed as sure as ferrets are ferrets  where can i have dropped them i wonder   alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kidgloves and she very goodnaturedly began hunting about for them but they were nowhere to be seeneverything seemed to have  42  the rabbit sends  changed since her swim in the pool  and the great hall with the glass table and the little door had vanished completely very soon the rabbit noticed alice as she went hunting about and called out to her in an angry tone  why mary ann what are you doing out here  run home this moment and  fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan  now    quick  and alice was so much frightened that  she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to without trying to explain the mistake that it had made  he took me for his housemaid she said to herself as she ran   how surprised he ll be  when he finds out who i am   but i d better  take him his fan and glovesthat is if i can find them  as she said this she came upon a  neat little house on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name  w rabbit  engraved upon it  she went in without knock  ing  upstairs  and hurried  in great fear lest  she should meet the real mary ann and be  in a little bill  43  turned out of the house before she had found the fan and gloves how queer it seems alice said to herself to be going messages for a rabbit  i suppose dinah ll be sending me on messages next   and she began fancying the sort of thing that would happen    miss alice  come here di rectly and get ready for your walk    coming in a minute nurse  but i ve got to watch this mousehole till dinah comes back and see that the mouse doesnt get out only i dont think alice went on that theyd let dinah stop in the house if it began ordering people about like that   by this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window and on it as she had hoped a fan and two or three pairs of tiny white kidgloves  she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves and was just going to leave the room when her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the lookingglass there was no label this time with the  44  the rabbit sends  words  drink me but nevertheless she un corked it and put it to her lips  i know something interesting is sure to happen she said to herself  whenever i eat or drink any thing  so ill just see what this bottle does i do hope itll make me grow large again for really im quite tired of being such a tiny little thing   it did so indeed and much sooner than she had expected  before she had drunk half the bottle she found her head pressing against the ceiling and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken she hastily put down the bottle saying to herself  thats quite enoughi hope i shant grow any moreas it is i cant get out at the doori do wish i hadnt drunk quite so much   alas  it was too late to wish that  she went on growing and growing and very soon had to kneel down on the floor  in another minute there was not even room for this and she tried the effect of lying down with one  in a little bill  45  elbow against the door and the other arm curled round her head still she went on grow ing and as a last resource she put one arm out of the window and one foot up the chimney and said to herself  now i can do no more whatever happens what will become of me   luckily for alice the little magic bottle had now had its full effect and she grew no larger  still it was very uncomfortable and as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever  46  the rabbit sends  getting out of the room again no wonder she felt unhappy  it was much pleasanter at home thought poor alice  when one wasnt always growing larger and smaller and being ordered about by mice and rabbits i almost wish i hadnt gone down that rabbitholeand yetand yetits rather curious you know this sort of life  i do wonder what can have happened to me  when i used to read fairy tales i fancied that kind of thing never happened and now here i am in the middle of one  there ought to be a book written about me that there ought  and when i grow up ill write onebut im grown up now she added in a sorrowful tone  at least theres no room to grow up any more here  but then thought alice  shall i never get any older than i am now  that ll be a comfort one waynever to be an old woman but thenalways to have lessons to learn  oh i shouldnt like that oh you foolish alice   she answered her  in a little bill  47  self  how can you learn lessons in here  why theres hardly room for you and no room at all for any lessonbooks   and so she went on taking first one side and then the other and making quite a conversation of it altogether  but after a few minutes she heard a voice outside and stopped to listen  mary ann  mary ann   said the voice  fetch me my gloves this moment   then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs alice knew it was the rabbit coming to look for her and she trembled till she shook the house quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large as the rabbit and had no reason to be afraid of it presently the rabbit came up to the door and tried to open it but as the door opened inwards and alices elbow was pressed hard against it that attempt proved a failure alice heard it say to itself then ill go round and get in at the window  that you wont   thought alice and after  48  the rabbit sends  waiting till she fancied she heard the rabbit just under the window she suddenly spread out her hand and made a snatch in the air she did not get hold of anything but she heard a little shriek and a fall and a crash of bro ken glass from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a cucumber  frame or something of the sort next came an angry voicethe rabbits pat pat where are you and then a voice she had never heard before  sure then i m here  digging for apples yer honour    digging for apples indeed 1  said the rabbit angrily  here  come and help me out of this   sounds of more broken glass  in a little bill  49  now tell me pat whats that in the win dow  sure it s an arm yer honour   he pro nounced it  arrum  an arm you goose  who ever saw one that size  why it fills the whole window    sure it does yer honour  but it s an arm for all that  well its got no business there at any rate  go and take it away   there was a long silence after this and alice could only hear whispers now and then  such as  sure i dont like it yer honour at all at all    do as i tell you you coward   and at last she spread out her hand again and made another snatch in the air this time there were two little shrieks and more sounds of broken glass  what a number of cucumberframes there must be   thought alice  i wonder what they ll do next  as for pulling me out of the window i only wish they could  i m sure i dont want to stay in here any longer   e  50  the rabbit sends  she waited for some time without hearing anything more  at last came a rumbling of little cartwheels and the sound of a good many voices all talking together  she made out the words   where s the other ladder why i hadnt to bring but one bills got the other bill  fetch it here lad here put em up at this cornerno tie em together firstthey dont reach half high enough yetoh they ll do well enough dont be particularhere bill  catch hold of this ropewill the roof bear mind that loose skteoh it s coming down  heads below   a loud crash now who did that  it was bill i fancywhos to go down the chimneynay i shant  you do itthat i wont then bill s got to go downhere bill i the master says youve got to go down the chimney    oh  so bill s got to come down the chim ney has he   said alice to herself  why they seem to put everything upon bill 1 i wouldnt be in bills place for a good deal  in a little bill  51  this fireplace is narrow to be sure  but i think i can kick a little   she drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could and waited till she heard a little animal she  couldnt  guess  of    what sort it was scratchw ing and scrambling about in the chimney close above her  then saying to her self this is bill she gave one sharp kick and waited to see what would happen next the first thing she heard  was  a  general  chorus of there goes bill   then the rabbits voice alone catch him you by the hedge   then e 2  52  the rabbit sends  silence and then another confusion of voices hold up his headbrandy nowdont choke himhow was it old fellow  what happened to you  tell us all about it   last came a little feeble squeaking voice thats bill thought alice well i hardly knowno more thank ye  i m better nowbut i m a deal too flustered to tell youall i know is something comes at me like a jackinthebox and up i goes like a skyrocket    so you did old fellow   said the others  we must burn the house down   said the rabbits voice and alice called out as loud as she could  if you do i ll set dinah at you   there was a dead silence instantly and alice thought to herself  i wonder what they will do next  if they had any sense they d take the roof off  after a minute or two they began moving about again and alice heard the rabbit say  a barrowful will do to begin with  a barrowful of what   thought alice but she had not long to doubt for the next moment  in a little bill  53  a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the window and some of them hit her in the face  i ll put a stop to this she said to herself and shouted out youd better not do that again which produced another dead silence alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor and a bright idea came into her head if i eat one of these cakes she thought its sure to make some change in my size  and as it cant possibly make me larger it must make me smaller i suppose so she swallowed one of the cakes and was delighted to find that she began shrinking directly as soon as she was small enough to get through the door she ran out of the house and found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside the poor little lizard bill was in the middle being held up by two guineapigs who were giving it something out of a bottle they all made a rush at alice the moment she appeared  but she ran off as hard  64  the rabbit sends  as she could and soon found herself safe in a thick wood  the first thing i ve got to do said alice to herself as she wandered about in the wood is to grow to my right size again  and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden i think that will be the best plan it sounded an excellent plan no doubt and very neatly and simply arranged  the only diffi culty was that she had not the smallest idea how to set about it  and while she was peering about anxiously among the trees a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a great hurry an enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes and feebly stretching out one paw trying to touch her  poor little thing   said alice in a coaxing tone and she tried hard to whistle to it  but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be hungry in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing  in a little bill  05  hardly knowing what she did she picked up a little bit of stick and held it out to the puppy whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off all its  feet at once with  a yelp  of  v  56  the rabbit sends  delight and rushed at the stick and made be lieve to worry it  then alice dodged behind a great thistle to keep herself from being run over and the moment she appeared on the other side the puppy made another rush at the stick and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold of it  then alice thinking it was very like having a game of play with a cart horse and expecting every moment to be tram pled under its feet ran round the thistle again  then the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick running a very little way forwards each time and a long way back and barking hoarsely all the while till at last it sat down a good way off panting with its tongue hang ing out of its mouth and its great eyes half shut this seemed to alice a good opportunity for making her escape  so she set off at once and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath and till the puppys bark sounded quite faint in the distance  in a little bill  87   and yet what a dear little puppy it was   said alice as she leant against a buttercup to rest herself and fanned herself with one of the leaves  i should have liked teaching it tricks very much ifif id only been the right size to do it  oh dear  i d nearly forgotten that i ve got to grow up again  let me seehow is it to be managed  i suppose i ought to eat or drink something or other  but the great question is  what    the great question certainly was  what   alice looked all round her at the flowers and the blades of grass but she could not see any thing that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances there was a large mushroom growing near her about the same height as herself  and when she had looked under it and on both sides of it and behind it it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it she stretched herself up on tiptoe and peeped over the edge of the mushroom and her  68  the rabbit sends in a little bill  eyes immediately met those of a large blue caterpillar that was sitting on the top with its arms folded quietly smoking a long hookah and taking not the smallest notice of her or of any thing else  61  chapter v advice from a caterpillar  the caterpillar and alice looked at each other for some time in silence  at last the caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and addressed her in a languid sleepy voice  58  advice from a   who are you   said the caterpillar this was not an encouraging opening for a conversation alice replied rather shyly  ii hardly know sir just at presentat least i know who i was when i got up this morning but i think i must have been changed several times since then   what do you mean by that   said the caterpillar sternly  explain yourself    i cant explain myself i m afraid sir said alice  because i m not myself you see  i dont see said the caterpillar  i m afraid i cant put it more clearly alice replied very politely for i cant under stand it myself to begin with  and being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing  it isnt said the caterpillar  well perhaps you havent found it so yet said alice   but when you have to turn into a chrysalisyou will some day you knowand then after that into a butterfly i should think you ll feel it a little queer wont you    caterpillar  61  not a bit said the caterpillar  well perhaps your feelings may be different said alice  all i know is it would feel very queer to me  you   said the caterpillar contemptuously t who are you which brought them back again to the be ginning of the conversation  alice felt a little  irritated at the caterpillars making such very short remarks and she drew herself up and said very gravely  i think you ought to tell me who you are first  why   said the caterpillar here was another puzzling question  and as alice could not think of any good reason and the  caterpillar seemed to be in  a  very un  pleasant state of mind she turned away  come back   the caterpillar called after her  i ve something important to say   this sounded promising certainly alice turned and came back again  keep your temper said the caterpillar  62  advice from a   is that all   said alice swallowing down her anger as well as she could  no said the caterpillar alice thought she might as well wait as she had nothing else to do and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing for some minutes it puffed away without speak ing  but at last it unfolded its arms took the hookah out of its mouth again and said  so you think youre changed do you  i m afraid i am sir said alice  i cant remember things as i usedand i dont keep the same size for ten minutes together    cant remember what things   said the caterpillar  well i ve tried to say  how doth the little busy bee but it all came different 1  alice replied in a very melancholy voice  repeat  you are old father william  said the caterpillar alice folded her hands and began   caterpillar  63   you are old father william the young man said  and your hair has become very white  and yet you incessantly stand on your head do you think at your age it is right t   in my youth father william replied to his son  i feared it might injure the brain  but now that i m perfectly sure i have none why i do it again and again  64  advice from a   you are old said the youth as i mentioned before and have grown most uncommonly fat yet you turned a backsomersault in at the door pray what is the reason of that     in my youth said the sage as he shook his grey locks i kept all my limbs very supple by the use of this ointmentone shilling the box allow me to sell you a couple  caterpillar  65   you are old said the youth and yourjaws are too weak for anything tougher than suet yet you finished the goose with the bones and the beak pray how did you manage to do it     in my youth said his father  i took to the law and argued each case with my wife  and the muscular strength which it gave to my jaw has lasted the rest of my life f  66  advice from a   you are old said the youth  one would iiardly suppose that your eye was as steady as ever yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose what made you so awfully clever   i have answered three questions and that is enough said his father  dont give yourself airs  do you think i can listen all day to such stuff be off or ill kick you downstairs  caterpillar  67   that is not said right said the caterpillar  not quite right i m afraid said alice timidly   some of the words have got altered it is wrong from beginning to end said the caterpillar decidedly  and there was silence for some minutes the caterpillar was the first to speak  what size do you want to be   it asked  oh i m not particular as to size alice hastily replied   only one doesnt like changing so often you know  i dont know said the caterpillar alice said nothing  she had never been so much contradicted in all her life before and she felt that she was losing her temper  are you content now   said the caterpillar  well i should like to be a little larger sir if you wouldnt mind said alice   three inches is such a wretched height to be  it is a very good height indeed   said the caterpillar angrily rearing itself upright as it spoke it was exactly three inches high v 2  68  advice from a   but i m not used to it   pleaded poor alice in a piteous tone and she thought to herself  i wish the creatures wouldnt be so easily offended    you ll get used to it in time said the caterpillar  and it put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again this time alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again in a minute or two the cater pillar took the hookah out of its mouth and yawned once or twice and shook itself then it got down off the mushroom and crawled away into the grass merely remarking as it went  one side will make you grow taller and the other side will make you grow shorter  one side of what  the other side of what f  thought alice to herself  of the mushroom said the caterpillar just as if she had asked it aloud  and in another moment it was out of sight alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute trying to make out  caterpillar  69  which were the two sides of it  and as it was perfectly round she found this a very difficult question however at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand  and now which is which   she said to herself and nibbled a little of the righthand bit to try the effect the next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her chin  it had struck her foot  she was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change but she felt that there was no time to be lost as she was shrinking rapidly  so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit her chin was pressed so closely against her foot that there was hardly room to open her mouth  but she did it at last and managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit  70  advice from a   come my head s free at last   said alice in a tone of delight which changed into alarm in another moment when she found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found  all she could see when she looked down was an im mense length of neck which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below her  what can all that green stuff be   said alice  and where have my shoulders got to  and oh my poor hands how is it i cant see you   she was moving them about as she spoke but no result seemed to follow except a little shaking among the distant green leaves as there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head she tried to get her head down to them and was delighted to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction like a serpent she had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag and was going to dive in among the leaves which she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees  caterpillar  71  under which she had been wandering when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry  a large pigeon had flown into her face and was beating her violently with its wings  serpent   screamed the pigeon  i m not a serpent   said alice indignantly  let me alone    serpent i say again   repeated the pigeon but in a more subdued tone and added with a kind of sob  i ve tried every way but nothing seems to suit them    i havent the least idea what you re talking about said alice  i ve tried the roots of trees and i ve tried banks and i ve tried hedges the pigeon went on without attending to her   but those serpents  there s no pleasing them   alice was more and more puzzled but she thought there was no use in saying anything more till the pigeon had finished as if it wasnt trouble enough hatching the eggs said the pigeon   but i must be on  72  advice from a  the lookout for serpents night and day  why i havent had a wink of sleep these three weeks    i m very sorry you ve been annoyed said alice who was beginning to see its meaning  and just as i d taken the highest tree in the wood continued the pigeon raising its voice to a shriek  and just as i was thinking i should be free of them at last they must needs come wriggling down from the sky  ugh serpent    but i m not a serpent i tell you   said alice  i m a  m a   well  what are you   said the pigeon  i can see you re trying to invent something    ii m a little girl said alice rather doubtfully as she remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day  a likely story indeed   said the pigeon in a tone of the deepest contempt  i ve seen a good many little girls in my time but never one with such a neck as that  no no i you re a  caterpillar  73  serpent  and there s no use denying it i sup pose youll be telling me next that you never tasted an egg    i have tasted eggs certainly said alice who was a very truthful child   but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do you know  i dont believe it said the pigeon   but if they do why then they re a kind of serpent  thats all i can say this was such a new idea to alice that she was quite silent for a minute or two which gave the pigeon the opportunity of adding  you re looking for eggs i know that well enough  and what does it matter to me whether youre a little girl or a serpent    it matters a good deal to me said alice hastily   but i m not looking for eggs as it happens  and if i was i shouldnt want yours  i dont like them raw  well be off then   said the pigeon in a sulky tone as it settled down again into its  74  advice from a  nest alice crouched down among the trees as well as she could for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it after a while she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands and she set to work very carefully nibbling first at one and then at the other and growing some times taller and sometimes shorter until she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height it was so long since she had been anything near the right size that it felt quite strange at first  but she got used to it in a few minutes and began talking to herself as usual  come there s half my plan done now  how puzzling all these changes are  i m never sure what im going to be from one minute to another  however i ve got back to my right size  the next thing is to get into that beautiful gardenhow is that to be done i wonder   as she said this she came suddenly  caterpillar  75  upon an open place with a little house in it about four feet high whoever lives there thought alice  it ll never do to come upon them this size  why i should frighten them out of their wits   so she began nibbling at the righthand bit again and did not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high  chapter vi pig and pepper  for a minute or two she stood looking at the house and wondering what to do next when suddenly a footman in livery came run ning out of the woodshe considered him to be a footman because he was in livery  other wise judging by his face only she would have called him a fishand rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles it was opened by another footman in livery with a round face and large eyes like a frog  and both footmen alice noticed had powdered hair that curled all over their heads she felt very curious to know what it was all about and crept a little way out of the wood to listen  pig and pepper  77  the fishfootman began by producing from under his arm a great letter nearly as large as himself and this he handed over to the other saying in a solemn tone  for the duchess an invitation from the queen to play  78  pig and pepper  croquet the frogfootman repeated in the same solemn tone only changing the order of the words a little  from the queen an invi tation for the duchess to play croquet then they both bowed low and their curls got entangled together alice laughed so much at this that she had to run back into the wood for fear of their hearing her  and when she next peeped out the fishfootman was gone and the other was sitting on the ground near the door staring stupidly up into the sky alice went timidly up to the door and knocked theres no sort of use in knocking said the footman  and that for two reasons first because i m on the same side of the door as you are  secondly because they re making such a noise inside no one could possibly hear you and certainly there was a most extraordinary noise going on withina constant howling and sneezing and every now and then a great  pig and pepper  79  crash as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces  please then said alice  how am i to get in    there might be some sense in your knock ing the footman went on without attending to her if we had the door between us for instance if you were inside you might knock and i could let you out you know he was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking and this alice thought decidedly un civil  but perhaps he cant help it she said to herself   his eyes are so very nearly at the top of his head but at any rate he might answer questionshow am i to get in   she repeated aloud  i shall sit here the footman remarked  till tomorrow  at this moment the door of the house opened and a large plate came skimming out straight at the footmans head  it just grazed his nose and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him   pig and pepper   or next day maybe the footman con tinued in the same tone exactly as if nothing had happened  how am i to get in   asked alice again in a louder tone  are you to get in at all   said the foot man  that s the first question you know it was no doubt  only alice did not like to be told so  it s really dreadful she muttered to herself  the way all the creatures argue it s enough to drive one crazy   the footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his remark with varia tions  i shall sit here he said  on and off for days and days  but what am i to do   said alice  anything you like said the footman and began whistling  oh there s no use in talking to him said alice desperately   he s perfectly idiotic   and she opened the door and went in the door led right into a large kitchen  pig and pepper  81  which was full of smoke from one end to the other  the duchess was sitting on a threelegged stool in the middle nursing a baby  the cook was leaning over the fire stirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup  there s certainly too much pepper in that soup   alice said to herself as well as she could for sneezing  82  pig and pepper  there was certainly too much of it in the air even the duchess sneezed occasionally  and as for the baby it was sneezing and howl ing alternately without a moments pause the only two creatures in the kitchen that did not sneeze were the cook and a large cat which was lying on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear  please would you tell me said alice a little timidly for she was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first  why your cat grins like that  it s a cheshirecat said the duchess  and that s why pig   she said the last word with such sudden violence that alice quite jumped  but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby and not to her so she took courage and went on again   i didnt know that cheshirecats always grinned  in fact i didnt know that cats could grin  pig and pepper  83  they all can said the duchess and most of em do  i dont know of any that do alice said very politely feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation  you dont know much said the duchess   and that s a fact alice did not at all like the tone of this remark and thought it would be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation while she was trying to fix on one the cook took the cauldron of soup off the fire and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at the duchess and the babythe fireirons came first  then followed a shower of sauce pans plates and dishes the duchess took no notice of them even when they hit her  and the baby was howling so much already that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not  oh please mind what you re doing   cried alice jumping up and down in an agony of o 2  84  pig and pepper  terror  oh there goes his precious nose   as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it and very nearly carried it off  if everybody minded their own business the duchess said in a hoarse growl  the world would go round a deal faster than it does  which would not be an advantage said alice who felt very glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge  just think what work it would make with the day and night  you see the earth takes twentyfour hours to turn round on its axis   talking of axes said the duchess  chop off her head   alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook to see if she meant to take the hint  but the cook was busily stirring the soup and seemed not to be listening so she went on again   twentyfour hours i think  or is it twelve  i   oh dont bother me   said the duchess  i never could abide figures   and with that she began nursing her child again singing a sort of  pig and pepper  85  lullaby to it as she did so and giving it a violent shake at the end of every line  speak roughly to your little boy and beat him when he sneezes he only does it to annoy because he knows it teases chorus in which the cook and the baby joined   wow  wow  wow   while the duchess sang the second verse of the song she kept tossing the baby violently up and down and the poor little thing howled so that alice could hardly hear the words  i speak severely to my boy i beat him when he sneezes for he can thoroughly enjoy the pepper when he pleases   chorus  wow  wow  wow    86  pig and pepper   here  you may nurse it a bit if you like   the duchess said to alice flinging the baby at her as she spoke  i must go and get ready to play croquet with the queen and she hurried out of the room the cook threw a fryingpan after her as she went but it just missed her alice caught the baby with some difficulty as it was a queershaped little creature and held out its arms and legs in all directions just like a starfish thought alice the poor little thing was snorting like a steamengine when she caught it and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again so that altogether for the first minute or two it was as much as she could do to hold it as soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it which was to twist it up into a sort of knot and then keep tight hold of its right ear and left foot so as to prevent its undoing itself she carried it out into the open air  if i dont take this child away with me thought alice  they re sure to kill it in a day  pig and pepper  87  or two wouldnt it be murder to leave it be hind  she said the last words out loud and the little thing grunted in reply it had left off sneezing by this time  dont grunt said alice   that s not at all a proper way of ex pressing yourself the baby grunted again and alice looked very anxiously into its face to see what was the matter with it there could be no doubt that it had a very turnup nose much more like a snout than a real nose  also its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby  altogether alice did not like the look of the thing at all but perhaps it was only sobbing she thought and looked into its eyes again to see if there were any tears no there were no tears  if you re going to turn into a pig my dear said alice seriously  i ll have nothing more to do with you mind now the poor little thing sobbed again or grunted it was impossible to say which and they went on for some while in silence  88  pig and pepper  alice was just beginning to think to herself  now what am i to do with this creature when i get it home when it grunted again so violently that she looked down into its face in some alarm this time there could be no mistake about it  it was neither more nor less than a pig and she felt that  it  would  be  quite absurd for her to carry it any fur ther so she set the little creature down and felt quite relieved to see it trot away quietly into the wood   if  it had grown up she said to herself  it would have made a dreadfully ugly child  but it makes rather a handsome pig i think  and she be  gan thinking over other children she knew who  pig and pepper  89  might do very well as pigs and was just say ing to herself  if one only knew the right way to change them  when she was a little startled by seeing the cheshirecat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off the cat only grinned when it saw alice it looked goodnatured she thought  still it had very long claws and a great many teeth so she felt that it ought to be treated with respect  cheshirepuss she began rather timidly as she did not at all know whether it would like the name  however it only grinned a little wider come its pleased so far thought alice and she went on  would you tell me please which way i ought to go from here    that depends a good deal on where you want to get to said the cat  i dont much care where  said alice  then it doesnt matter which way you go said the cat  so long as i get somewhere alice added as an explanation  90  pig and pepper  oh you re sure to do that said the cat  if you only walk long enough alice felt that this could not be denied so she tried another question  what sort of people live about here    in that direction the cat said waving its right paw round  lives a hatter  and in that direction waving the other paw  lives a march hare visit either you like  they re both mad  but i dont want to go among mad people alice remarked  oh you cant help that said the cat  were all mad here im mad youre mad  how do you know i m mad   said alice  you must be said the cat  or you wouldnt have come here alice didnt think that proved it at all  however she went on   and how do you know that you re mad    to begin with said the cat  a dog s not mad you grant that  i suppose so said alice  pig and pepper   well then the cat went on  you see a dog growls when its angry and wags its tail when it s pleased nowgrowl when i m pleased and wag my tail when im angry there fore im mad  i call it purring not growling said alice  call it what you like said the cat  do you play croquet with the queen today    92  pig and pepper   i should like it very much said alice  but i havent been invited yet  you ll see me there said the cat and vanished alice was not much surprised at this she was getting so well used to queer things happening while she was still looking at the place where it had been it suddenly appeared again  bythebye what became of the baby   said the cat  i d nearly forgotten to ask  it turned into a pig alice answered very quietly just as if the cat had come back in a natural way i thought it would said the cat and vanished again alice waited a little half expecting to see it again but it did not appear and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in which the march hare was said to live  i ve seen hatters before she said to herself   the march hare will be much the most interesting and perhaps as this is may it wont be raving mad  pig and pepper  93  at least not so mad as it was in march as she said this she looked up and there was the cat again sitting on a branch of a tree  did you say  pig  or  fig    said the cat  i said  pig  replied alice   and i wish you wouldnt keep appearing and vanishing so sud denly  you make one quite giddy    all right said the cat  and this time it vanished quite slowly beginning with the end of the tail and ending with the grin which remained some time after the rest of it had gone  94  pig and pepper   well  i ve often seen a cat without a grin thought alice   but a grin without a cat  its the most curious thing i ever saw in all my life she had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of the march hare  she thought it must be the right house because the chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur it was so large a house that she did not like to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mush room and raised herself to about two feet high  even then she walked up towards it rather timidly saying to herself  suppose it should be raving mad after all  i almost wish i d gone to see the hatter instead    chapter vii a mad teaparty  there was a table set out under a tree in front of the house and the march hare and the hatter were having tea at it  a dormouse was sitting between them fast asleep and the other two were using it as a cushion resting their elbows on it and talking over its head  very uncomfortable for the dormouse thought alice  only as its asleep i suppose it doesnt mind the table was a large one but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it  no room  no room   they cried out when they saw alice coming  theres plenty of room   said  s  98  a mad teaparty  alice indignantly and she sat down in a large armchair at one end of the table  have some wine the march hare said in an encouraging tone alice looked all round the table but there was nothing on it but tea  i dont see any wine she remarked there isnt any said the march hare  then it wasnt very civil of you to offer it said alice angrily  it wasnt very civil of you to sit down without being invited said the march hare  i didnt know it was your table said alice   it s laid for a great many more than three  your hair wants cutting said the hatter he had been looking at alice for some time with great curiosity and this was his first speech  you should learn not to make personal remarks alice said with some severity  its very rude  97  a mad teaparty  the hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this  but all he said was  why is a raven like a writingdesk  come  we  thought alice  shall have some  fun  now    im glad theyve begun ask  ing riddlesi believe i can guess that she added aloud  do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it   said the march hare exactly so said alice  98  a mad teaparty   then you should say what you mean the march hare went on  i do alice hastily replied   at leastat least i mean what i saythats the same thing you know  not the same thing a bit   said the hatter  why you might just as well say that  i see what i eat  is the same thing as  i eat what i see    you might just as well say added the march hare  that  i like what i get  is the same thing as  i get what i like    you might just as well say added the dormouse which seemed to be talking in its sleep that  i breathe when i sleep is the same thing as  i sleep when i breathe     it is the same thing with you said the hatter and here the conversation dropped and the party sat silent for a minute while alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and writingdesks which wasnt much the hatter was the first to break the silence  a mad teaparty  99  what day of the month is it he said turn ing to alice  he had taken his watch out of his pocket and was looking at it uneasily shak ing it every now and then and holding it to his ear alice considered a little and then said  the fourth  two days wrong   sighed the hatter  i told you butter wouldnt suit the works   he added looking angrily at the march hare  it was the best butter the march hare meekly replied  yes but some crumbs must have got in as well the hatter grumbled   you shouldnt have put it in with the breadknife the march hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily  then he dipped it into his cup of tea and looked at it again  but he could think of nothing better to say than his first remark  it was the best butter you know alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity  what a funny watch   she h 2  100  a mad teaparty  remarked  it tells the day of the month and doesnt tell what oclock it is   why should it muttered the hatter  does your watch tell you what year it is    of course not alice replied very readily   but that s because it stays the same year for such a long time together which is just the case with mine said the hatter alice felt dreadfully puzzled the hatters remark seemed to her to have no sort of meaning in it and yet it was certainly english  i dont quite understand you she said as politely as she could  the dormouse is asleep again said the hat ter and he poured a little hot tea upon its nose the dormouse shook its head impatiently and said without opening its eyes  of course of course  just what i was going to remark myself  have you guessed the riddle yet   the hatter said turning to alice again  a mad teaparty  101  no i give it up alice replied whats the answer    i havent the slightest idea said the hatter  nor i said the march hare alice sighed wearily  i think you might do something better with the time she said than wasting it in asking riddles that have no answers  if you knew time as well as i do said the hatter  you wouldnt talk about wasting  it  its him   i dont know what you mean said alice  of course you dont   the hatter said tossing his head contemptuously  i dare say you never even spoke to time    perhaps not alice cautiously replied   but i know i have to beat time when i learn music  ah  that accounts for it said the hatter  he wont stand beating now if you only kept on good terms with him hed do almost  102  a mad teaparty  anything you liked with the clock for in stance suppose it were nine oclock in the morn ing just time to begin lessons youd only have to whisper a hint to time and round goes the clock in a twinkling  halfpast one time for dinner   i only wish it was the march hare said to itself in a whisper that would be grand certainly said alice thoughtfully   but theni shouldnt be hungry for it you know  not at first perhaps said the hatter   but you could keep it to halfpast one as long as you liked is that the way you manage alice asked the hatter shook his head mournfully  not i   he replied  we quarreled last march just before he went mad you know  point ing with his teaspoon at the march hare  it was at the great concert given by the queen of hearts and i had to sing  a mad teaparty  103   twinkle twinkle little bat  how i wonder what you re at   you know the song perhaps   ive heard something like it said alice  it goes on you know the hatter continued  in this way   up above the world you fly like a teatray in the sky twinkle twinkle here the dormouse shook itself and began  104  a mad teaparty  singing in its sleep  twinkle twinkle twinkle twinkle   and went on so long that they had  to pinch it to make it stop well id hardly finished the first verse said the hatter  when the queen bawled out  hes murdering the time   off with his head      how dreadfully savage   exclaimed alice  and ever since that the hatter went on in a mournful tone  he wont do a thing i ask  its always six oclock now a bright idea came into alices head   is  that the reason so many teathings are put out here   she asked  yes that s it said the hatter with a sigh  its always teatime and weve no time to wash the things between whiles  then you keep moving round i suppose   said alice  exactly so said the hatter   as the things get used up  but what happens when you come to the beginning again   alice ventured to ask  a mad teaparty  105   suppose we change the subject the march hare interrupted yawning  i m getting tired of this i vote the young lady tells us a story  i m afraid i dont know one said alice rather alarmed at the proposal  then the dormouse shall   they both cried  wake up dormouse   and they pinched it on both sides at once the dormouse slowly opened its eyes  i wasnt asleep it said in a hoarse feeble voice  i heard every word you fellows were saying  tell us a story   said the march hare  yes please do   pleaded alice  and be quick about it added the hatter  or you ll be asleep again before it s done  once upon a time there were three little sisters the dormouse began in a great hurry   and their names were elsie lacie and tillie  and they lived at the bottom of a well   what did they live on   said alice who always took a great interest in questions of eating and drinking  106  a mad teaparty   they lived on treacle said the dormouse after thinking a minute or two  they couldnt have done that you know alice gently remarked  they d have been ill  so they were said the dormouse  very ill alice tried a little to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary way of living would be like but it puzzled her too much  so she went on   but why did they live at the bottom of a well take some more tea the march hare said to alice very earnestly  i ve had nothing yet alice replied in an offended tone  so i cant take more  you mean you cant take less said the hatter   it s very easy to take more than nothing nobody asked your opinion said alice whos making personal remarks now the hatter asked triumphantly alice did not quite know what to say to this  so she helped herself to some tea and  a mad teaparty  107  breadandbutter and then turned to the dor mouse and repeated her question why did they live at the bottom of a well the dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it and then said  it was a treaclewell  there s no such thing   alice was begin ning very angrily but the hatter and the march hare went  sh  sh   and the dormouse sulkily remarked  if you cant be civil you d better finish the story for yourself  no please go on   alice said very humbly  i wont interrupt you again i dare say there may be one  one indeed   said the dormouse indig nantly however he consented to go on  and so these three little sistersthey were learning to draw you know   what did they draw   said alice quite forgetting her promise treacle said the dormouse without consi dering at all this time  108  a mad teaparty   i want a clean cup interrupted the hatter   let s all move one place on he moved on as he spoke and the dormouse followed him  the march hare moved into the dormouses place and alice rather unwillingly took the place of the march hare  the hatter  was the only one who got any advantage from the change  and alice was a good deal worse off than before as the march hare had just upset the milk jug into his plate alice did not wish to offend the dormouse again so she began very cautiously  dont understand   but i  where did they draw the  treacle from    you can draw water out of a waterwell said the hatter  so i should think you could draw treacle out of a treaclewelleh stupid    but they were in the well alice said to the dormouse not choosing to notice this last remark  of course they were said the dormouse   well in  a mad teaparty  109  this answer so confused poor alice that she let the dormouse go on for some time without interrupting it they were learning to draw the dormouse went on yawning and rubbing its eyes for it was getting very sleepy   and they drew all manner of thingseverything that begins with an m   why with an m   said alice  why not   said the march hare alice was silent the dormouse had closed its eyes by this time and was going off into a doze  but on being pinched by the hatter it woke up again with a little shriek and went on   that begins with an m such as mousetraps and the moon and memory and muchnessyou know you say things are much of a muchnessdid you ever see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness    really now you ask me said alice very much confused  i dont think     110  a mad teaparty   then you shouldnt talk said the hatter this piece of rudeness was more than alice could bear  she got up in great disgust and walked off the dormouse fell asleep instantly and neither of the others took the least notice  of her going though she looked back once or twice half hoping that they would call after her  the last time she saw them they were trying to put the dormouse into the teapot  at any rate i ll never go there again   said  a mad teaparty  1h  alice as she picked her way through the wood  it s the stupidest teaparty i ever was at in all my life   just as she said this she noticed that one of the trees had a door leading right into it  that s very curious   she thought  but every thing s curious today i think i may as well go in at once and in she went once more she found herself in the long hall and close to the little glass table  now i ll manage better this time she said to herself and began by taking the little golden key and unlocking the door that led into the garden then she set to work nibbling at the mushroom she had kept a piece of it in her pocket till she was about a foot high  then she walked down the little passage  and thenshe found herself at last in the beautiful garden among the bright flowerbeds and the cool fountains  chapter viii the queens croquet ground  a large rosetree stood near the entrance of the garden  the roses growing on it were white but there were three gardeners at it busily painting them red alice thought this a very curious thing and she went nearer to watch them and just as she came up to them she heard one of them say  look out now five  dont go splashing paint over me like that    i couldnt help it said five in a sulky tone  seven jogged my elbow on which seven looked up and said  that s right five  always lay the blame on others    the queens croquetground  113   you d better not talk   said five  i heard the queen say only yesterday you deserved to be beheaded what for said the one who had spoken first  that s none of your business two   said seven  yes it is his business   said five and ill tell himit was for bringing the cook tuliproots in stead of onions seven flung down his brush and had just begun  well of all the unjust things when his eye chanced to fall upon alice as she stood watching them and he checked himself suddenly  the others looked round also and all of them bowed low  114  the queens   would you tell me please said alice a little timidly why you are painting those roses   five and seven said nothing but looked at two two began in a low voice  why the fact is you see miss this here ought to have been a red rosetree and we put a white one in by mistake  and if the queen was to find it out we should all have our heads cut off you know so you see miss we re doing our best afore she comes to at this moment five who had been anxiously looking across the garden called out  the queen  the queen   and the three gardeners instantly threw them selves flat upon their faces there was a sound of many footsteps and alice looked round eager to see the queen first came ten soldiers carrying clubs  these were all shaped like the three gardeners oblong and flat with their hands and feet at the corners  next the ten courtiers  these were ornamented all over with diamonds and walked two and v  croquetground  115  two as the soldiers did after these came the royal children  there were ten of them and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand in hand in couples  they were all orna mented with hearts next came the guests mostly kings and queens and among them alice recognised the white rabbit  it was talk ing in a hurried nervous manner smiling at everything that was said and went by without noticing her then followed the knave of hearts carrying the kings crown on a crimson velvet cushion  and last of all this grand pro cession came the king and the queen of hearts alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face like the three gardeners but she could not remember ever having heard of such a rule at processions   and besides what would be the use of a procession thought she if people had all to lie down on their faces so that they couldnt see it   so she stood where she was and waited i 2  116  the queens  when the procession came opposite to alice they all stopped and looked at her and the queen said severely  who is this   she said it to the knave of hearts who only bowed and smiled in reply  idiot   said the queen tossing her head impatiently  and turning to alice she went on   what s your name child    my name is alice so please your majesty said alice very politely  but she added to her self  why they re only a pack of cards after all i neednt be afraid of them    and who are these   said the queen point ing to the three gardeners who were lying round the rosetree  for you see as they were lying on their faces and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the pack she could not tell whether they were gardeners or soldiers or courtiers or three of her own children  how should i know   said alice surprised at her own courage  it s no business of mine  croquetground  the queen turned crimson with fury and after glaring at her for a moment like a wild beast began screaming  off with her head  off with   118  the queens   nonsense   said alice very loudly and decidedly and the queen was silent the king laid his hand upon her arm and timidly said  consider my dear  she is only a child the queen turned angrily away from him and said to the knave  turn them over   the knave did so very carefully with one foot  get up   said the queen in a shrill loud voice and the three gardeners instantly jumped up and began bowing to the king the queen the royal children and everybody else  leave off that   screamed the queen  you make me giddy and then turning to the rosetree she went on  what have you been doing here   may it please your majesty said two in a very humble tone going down on one knee as he spoke we were trying  i see   said the queen who had mean while been examining the roses  off with their heads   and the procession moved on  croquetground  119  three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners who ran to alice for protection  you shant be beheaded   said alice and she put them into a large flowerpot that stood near the three soldiers wandered about for a minute or two looking for them and then quietly marched off after the others are their heads off shouted the queen their heads are gone if it please your majesty   the soldiers shouted in reply thats right shouted the queen can you play croquet the soldiers were silent and looked at alice as the question was evidently meant for her  yes   shouted alice  come on then   roared the queen and alice joined the procession wondering very much what would happen next  it sit s a very fine day   said a timid voice at her side she was walking by the white rabbit who was peeping anxiously into her face  120  the queens   very said alice  wheres the duchess    hush  hush   said the rabbit in a low hurried tone he looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke and then raised himself upon tiptoe put his mouth close to her ear and whispered  she s under sentence of execu tion what for said alice  did you say  what a pity     the rabbit asked  no i didnt said alice  i dont think it s at all a pity i said  what for     she boxed the queens ears the rabbit began alice gave a little scream of laughter oh hush   the rabbit whispered in a frightened tone  the queen will hear you  you see she came rather late and the queen said  get to your places   shouted the queen in a voice of thunder and people began running about in all directions tumbling up against each other  however they got settled down in a minute or two and the game began  croquetground  121  alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquetground in her life  it was all ridges and furrows  the croquet balls were live hedgehogs and the mallets live flamingoes and the soldiers had to double themselves up and stand on their hands  and feet  to  make the arches the  chief  diffi  culty alice found at first was in managing her  flamingo   she  succeeded in getting its body tucked away comfortably  enough so  under her arm with its legs hanging down but generally just as she had got its neck nicely straightened out and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head it would twist itself round and look up in her face with such a puzzled expres  122  the queens  sion that she could not help bursting out laugh ing  and when she had got its head down and was going to begin again it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled itself and was in the act of crawling away  besides all this there was generally a ridge or a furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the hedgehog to and as the doubledup soldiers were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed the players all played at once without wait ing for turns quarreling all the while and fighting for the hedgehogs  and in a very short time the queen was in a furious passion and went stamping about and shouting  off with his head   or  off with her head   about once in a minute alice began to feel very uneasy  to be sure she had not as yet had any dispute with the queen but she knew that it might happen any minute and then thought she what would  croquetground  123  become of me  they re dreadfully fond of beheading people here  the great wonder is that there s any one left alive   she was looking about for some way of escape and wondering whether she could get away without being seen when she noticed a curious appearance in the air  it puzzled her very much at first but after watching it a minute or two she made it out to be a grin and she said to herself  it s the cheshirecat  now i shall have somebody to talk to  how are you getting on   said the cat as soon as there was mouth enough for it to speak with alice waited till the eyes appeared and then nodded  it s no use speaking to it she thought till its ears have come or at least one of them in another minute the whole head appeared and then alice put down her flamingo and began an account of the game feeling very glad she had some one to listen to her the cat seemed to think that there was  124  the queens  enough of it now in sight and no more of it appeared  i dont think they play at all fairly alice began in rather a complaining tone  and they all quarrel so dreadfully one cant hear oneself speakand they dont seem to have any rules in particular   at least  if there are nobody  attends to themand you ve no idea how con fusing it is all the things being alive  for in stance there s the arch i ve got to go through next walking about at the other end of the groundand  i  should  have  croqueted  the  queens hedgehog just now only it ran away when it saw mine coming   how do you like the queen  said the cat in a low voice  not at all tremely  said alice   just then  she   she s  noticed  so ex that  the  queen was close behind her listening  so she went on likely to win that it s hardly worth while finishing the game the queen smiled and passed on  croquetground  126   who are you talking to   said the king coming up to alice and looking at the cats head with great curiosity  it s a friend of minea cheshirecat said alice   allow me to introduce it  i don t like the look of it at all said the king   however it may kiss my hand if it likes  i d rather not the cat remarked  dont be impertinent said the king and dont look at me like that   he got behind alice as he spoke  a cat may look at a king said alice  i ve read that in some book but i dont remember where  well it must be removed said the king very decidedly  and he called to the queen who was passing at the moment  my dear  i wish you would have this cat removed   the queen had only one way of settling all difficulties great or small  off with his head   she said without even looking round  126  the queers   i ll fetch the executioner myself said the king eagerly and he hurried off alice thought she might as well go back and see how the game was going on as she heard the queens voice in the distance screaming with passion she had already heard her sen tence three of the players to be executed for having missed their turns and she did not like the look of things at all as the game was in such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or not so she went off in search of her hedgehog the hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog which seemed to alice an ex cellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the other  the only difficulty was that her flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden where alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree by the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back the fight was over and both the hedgehogs were out of sight   but it  croquetground  127  doesnt matter much thought alice as all the arches are gone from this side of the ground so she tucked it away under her arm that it might not escape again and went back to have a little more conversation with her friend when she got back to the cheshirecat she was surprised to find quite a large crowd col lected round it  there was a dispute going on between the executioner the king and the queen who were all talking at once while all the rest were quite silent and looked very uncomfortable the moment alice appeared she was appealed to by all three to settle the question and they repeated their arguments to her though as they all spoke at once she found it very hard to make out exactly what they said the executioners argument was that you couldnt cut off a head unless there was a body to cut it off from  that he had never had to do such a thing before and he wasnt going to begin at his time of life  128  the queens  the kings argument was that anything that had a head could be beheaded and that you werent to talk nonsense the queens argument was that if some thing wasn t done about it in less than no time shed have everybody executed all round it  croquetground  129  was this last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious alice could think of nothing else to say but  it belongs to the duchess  you d better ask her about it shes in prison the queen said to the executioner   fetch her here and the execu tioner went off like an arrow the cats head began fading away the moment he was gone and by the time he had come back with the duchess it had entirely disappeared  so the king and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it while the rest of the party went back to the game  chapter ix the mock turtles story   you cant think how glad i am to see you again you dear old thing   said the duchess as she tucked her arm affectionately into alices and they walked off together alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper and thought to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so savage when they met in the kitchen  when im a duchess she said to herself not in a very hopeful tone though  i wont have any pepper in my kitchen at all soup does very well withoutmaybe it s always pepper  the mock turtles story  131  that makes people hottempered she went on very much pleased at having found out a new kind of rule and vinegar that makes them sourand camomile that makes them bitter andand barleysugar and such things that make children sweettempered i only wish people knew that then they wouldnt be so stingy about it you know  she had quite forgotten the duchess by this time and was a little startled when she heard her voice close to her ear  you re thinking about something my dear and that makes you forget to talk i cant tell you just now what the moral of that is but i shall remember it in a bit perhaps it hasnt one alice ventured to remark  tut tut child   said the duchess  every things got a moral if only you can find it and she squeezed herself up closer to alices side as she spoke alice did not much like her keeping so close k 2   132  the mock  to her first because the duchess was very ugly  and secondly because she was exactly the right height to rest her chin on alices shoulder and it was an un comfortably sharp chin however she did not like to be rude  so she bore it as well as she could the games going on rather better now she said by way of keeping up the conversation a little  tis so said the duchess   and the moral of that isoh tis love tis love that makes the world go round     somebody said alice whispered  that it s done by everybody minding their own business    turtles story  133   ah well  it means much the same thing said the duchess digging her sharp little chin into alices shoulder as she added and the moral of that istake care of the sense and the sounds will take care of themselves  how fond she is of finding morals in things   alice thought to herself  i dare say you re wondering why i dont put my arm round your waist the duchess said after a pause   the reason is that i m doubt ful about the temper of your flamingo shall i try the experiment   he might bite alice cautiously replied not feeling at all anxious to have the experi ment tried  very true said the duchess   flamingoes and mustard both bite and the moral of that is birds of a feather flock together  only mustard isnt a bird alice remarked  right as usual said the duchess   what a clear way you have of putting things   its a mineral i think said alice r  134  the mock   of course it is said the duchess who seemed ready to agree to everything that alice said  there s a large mustardmine near here and the moral of that isthe more there is of mine the less there is of yours   oh i know   exclaimed alice who had not attended to this last remark  it s a vege table it doesnt look like one but it is  i quite agree with you said the duchess   and the moral of that is be what you would seem to beor if youd like it put more simplynever imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might appear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise   i think i should understand that better5 alice said very politely if i had it written down  but i cant quite follow it as you say it  that s nothing to what i could say if i chose the duchess replied in a pleased tone  turtles story  135  pray dont trouble yourself to say it any longer than that said alice  oh dont talk about trouble   said the duchess  i make you a present of every thing ive said as yet  a cheap sort of present   thought alice  i m glad people dont give birthdaypresents like that   but she did not venture to say it out loud  thinking again   the duchess asked with another dig of her sharp little chin ive a right to think said alice sharply for she was beginning to feel a little worried  just about as much right said the duchess  as pigs have to fly  and the m  but here to alices great surprise the duchesss voice died away even in the middle of her favourite word  moral and the arm that was linked into hers began to tremble alice looked up and there stood the queen in front of them with her arms folded frowning like a thunderstorm  136  the mock  a fine day your majesty 1  the duchess began in a low weak voice  now i give you fair warning shouted the queen stamping on the ground as she spoke   either you or your head must be off and that in about half no time  take your choice   the duchess took her choice and was gone in a moment  let s go on with the game the queen said to alice  and alice was too much frightened to say a word but slowly followed her back to the croquetground the other guests had taken advantage of the queens absence and were resting in the shade  however the moment they saw her they hurried back to the game the queen merely remarking that a moments delay would cost them their lives all the time they were playing the queen never left off quarreling with the other players and shouting off with his head or off with her head 1  those whom she sentenced  turtles story  137  were taken into custody by the soldiers who of course had to leave off being arches to do this so that by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left and all the players except the king the queen and alice were in custody and under sentence of execution then the queen left off quite out of breath and said to alice  have you seen the mock turtle yet  no said alice  i dont even know what a mock turtle is its the thing mock turtle soup is made from said the queen  i never saw one or heard of one said alice come on then said the queen and he shall tell you his history as they walked off together alice heard the king say in a low voice to the company gene rally  you are all pardoned  come that s a good thing   she said to herself for she had felt quite unhappy at the number of executions the queen had ordered  138  the mock  they very soon came upon a gryphon lying fast asleep in the sun if you dont know what a gryphon is look at the picture  up lazy thing i  said the queen  and take this young lady to see the mock turtle and to hear his history i must go back and see after some executions i have ordered   and she walked off leaving alice alone with the gryphon alice did not quite like the look of the creature but on the whole she thought it would be quite as  turtles story  139  safe to stay with it as to go after that savage queen  so she waited the gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes  then it watched the queen till she was out of sight  then it chuckled  what fun   said the gryphon half to itself half to alice  what is the fun   said alice  why she said the gryphon  it s all her fancy that  they never executes nobody you know come on    everybody says  come on   here thought alice as she went slowly after it  i never was so ordered about before in all my life never   they had not gone far before they saw the mock turtle in the distance sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock and as they came nearer alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break she pitied him deeply  what is his sorrow   she asked the gryphon and the gryphon answered very nearly in the same words as before  it s all his fancy that  he hasnt got no sorrow you know come on    140  the mock  so they went up to the mock turtle who looked at them with large eyes full of tears but said nothing  this here young lady said the gryphon she wants for to know your history she do  i ll tell it her said the mock turtle in a deep hollow tone  sit down both of you and dont speak a word till ive finished so they sat down and nobody spoke for some minutes alice thought to herself  i dont see how he can ever finish if he doesnt begin but she waited patiently  once said the mock turtle at last with a deep sigh  i was a real turtle these words were followed by a very long silence broken only by an occasional exclamation of hjckrrh from the gryphon and the con stant heavy sobbing of the mock turtle alice was very nearly getting up and saying thank you sir for your interesting story but she could not help thinking there must be more to come so she sat still and said nothing  turtles story  hi  when we were little the mock turtle went on at last more calmly though still sob bing a little now and then  we went to school  142    the mock  in the sea the master was an old turtlewe used to call him tortoise   why did you call him tortoise if he wasnt one   alice asked we called him tortoise because he taught us said the mock turtle angrily really you are very dull   you ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question added the gry phon  and then they both sat silent and looked at poor alice who felt ready to sink into the earth at last the gryphon said to the mock turtle drive on old fellow dont be all day about it   and he went on in these words  yes we went to school in the sea though you maynt believe it   i never said i didnt   interrupted alice you did said the mock turtle  hold your tongue   added the gryphon before alice could speak again the mock turtle went on  we had the best of educationsin fact we went to school every day   turtles story  148  ive been to a dayschool too said alice  you neednt be so proud as all that with extras asked the mock turtle a little anxiously  yes said alice  we learned french and music and washing said the mock turtle  certainly not   said alice indignantly  ah  then yours wasnt a really good school said the mock turtle in a tone of great relief  now at ours they had at the end of the bill  french music and washingextra   you couldnt have wanted it much said alice   living at the bottom of the sea  i couldnt afford to learn it said the mock turtle with a sigh  i only took the regular course what was that inquired alice  reeling and writhing of course to begin with the mock turtle replied   and then the different branches of arithmeticambition dis traction uglification and derision  144  the mock   i never heard of  uglification  alice ven tured to say  what is it   the gryphon lifted up both its paws in sur prise  never heard of uglifying   it exclaimed  you know what to beautify is i suppose    yes said alice doubtfully  it meansto makeanythingprettier  well then the gryphon went on  if you dont know what to uglify is you are a simpleton alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it  so she turned to the mock turtle and said  what else had you to learn    well there was mystery the mock turtle replied counting off the subjects on his flappers  mystery ancient and modern with seaography  then drawlingthe drawlingmaster was an old congereel that used to come once a week  he taught us drawling stretching and fainting in coils  what was that like   said alice  turtles story  145   well i cant show it you myself the mock turtle said im too stiff and the gryphon never learnt it  hadnt time said the gryphon   i went to the classical master though he was an old crab he was  i never went to him the mock turtle said with a sigh he taught laughing and grief they used to say so he did so he did said the gryphon sighing in his turn  and both creatures hid their faces in their paws and how many hours a day did you do lessons   said alice in a hurry to change the subject  ten hours the first day said the mock turtle   nine the next and so on  what a curious plan   exclaimed alice  that s the reason they re called lessons the gryphon remarked   because they lessen from day to day this was quite a new idea to alice and she l   the mock turtles story  thought it over a little before she made her next remark  then the eleventh day must have been a holiday    of course it was said the mock turtle  and how did you manage on the twelfth   alice went on eagerly thats enough about lessons the gryphon interrupted in a very decided tone  tell her something about the games now  chapter x the lobsterquadrille  the mock turtle sighed deeply and drew the back of one flapper across his eyes he looked at alice and tried to speak but for a minute or two sobs choked his voice  same as if he had a bone in his throat said the gryphon  and it set to work shaking him and punching him in the back at last the mock turtle recovered his voice and with tears running down his cheeks he went on again   you may not have lived much under the sea  i havent said alice and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster l 2  148  the l0bster  alice began to say  i once tasted  but checked herself hastily and said  no never   so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a lobsterquadrille is   no indeed said alice what sort of a dance is it    why said the gryphon  you first form into a line along the seashore   two lines   cried the mock turtle  seals turtles salmon and so on  then when you ve cleared all the jellyfish out of the way   that generally takes some time interrupted the gryphon you advance twice   each with a lobster as a partner   cried the gryphon  of course the mock turtle said   advance twice set to partners   change lobsters and retire in same order continued the gryphon  then you know the mock turtle went on  you throw the   quadrille  149   the lobsters   shouted the gryphon with a bound into the air  as far out to sea as you can   swim after them   screamed the gryphon  turn a somersault in the sea   cried the mock turtle capering wildly about  change lobsters again   yelled the gryphon at the top of its voice  back to land again andthats all the first figure said the mock turtle suddenly dropping his voice  and the two creatures who had been jumping about like mad things all this time sat down again very sadly and quietly and looked at alice  it must be a very pretty dance said alice timidly  would you like to see a little of it   said the mock turtle very much indeed said alice  come let s try the first figure   said the mock turtle to the gryphon we can do it without lobsters you know which shall sing    150  the lobster   oh you sing said the gryphon  i ve forgotten the words so they began solemnly dancing round and round alice every now and then treading on her toes when they passed too close and waving their forepaws to mark the time while the mock turtle sang this very slowly and sadly   quadrille  151   will you walk a little faster   said a whiting to a snail  there s a porpoise close behind us and he s treading on my tail see how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance  they are waiting on the shinglewill you come and join the dance will you wont you will you wont you will you join the dance  will you wont you will you wont you wont you join the dance    you can really have no notion how delightful it will be when they take us up and throw us with the lobsters out to sea   but the snail replied  too far too far   and gave a look askance said he thanked the whiting kindly but he would not join the dance would not could not would not could not would not join the dance would not could not would not could not could not join the dance  152  the lobster   what matters it how far we go his scaly friend replied  there is another shore you know upon the other side the further off from england the nearer is to france then turn not pale beloved snail but come and join the dance will you wont you will you wont you will you join the dance  will you wont you will you wont you wont you join the dance    thank you it s a very interesting dance to watch said alice feeling very glad that it was over at last   and i do so like that curious song about the whiting  oh as to the whiting said the mock turtle theyyouve seen them of course  yes said alice  i ve often seen them at dinn   she checked herself hastily   i dont know where dinn may be said the mock turtle   but if you ve seen them so often  of course you know what theyre  like   i believe so  alice replied thoughtfully  quadrille  155  they have their tails in their mouthsand theyre all over crumbs  you re wrong about the crumbs said the mock turtle crumbs would all wash off in the sea but they have their tails in their mouths  and the reason is here the mock turtle yawned and shut his eyes  tell her about the reason and all that he said to the gryphon the reason is said the gryphon that they would go with the lobsters to the dance so they got thrown out to sea so they had to fall a long way so they got their tails fast in their mouths so they couldnt get them out again thats all  thank you said alice  it s very interesting i never knew so much about a whiting before  i can tell you more than that if you like said the gryphon do you know why its called a whiting    i never thought about it said alice  why    154  the lobster   it does the boots and shoes the gryphon replied very solemnly alice was thoroughly puzzled  does the boots and shoes   she repeated in a wondering tone  why what are your shoes done with   said the gryphon  i mean what makes them so shiny   alice looked down at them and considered a little before she gave her answer  they re done with blacking i believe  boots and shoes under the sea the gry phon went on in a deep voice  are done with whiting now you know and what are they made of alice asked in a tone of great curiosity  soles and eels of course the gryphon re plied rather impatiently   any shrimp could have told you that  if i d been the whiting said alice whose thoughts were still running on the song  i d have said to the porpoise  keep back please 1 we dont want you with us    quadrille  156   they were obliged to have him with them the mock turtle said  no wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise  wouldnt it really   said alice in a tone of great surprise  of course not said the mock turtle  why if a fish came to me and told me he was going a journey i should say with what porpoise     dont you mean  purpose    said alice  i mean what i say the mock turtle replied in an offended tone and the gryphon added  come let s hear some of your adventures  i could tell you my adventuresbeginning from this morning said alice a little timidly   but it s no use going back to yesterday be cause i was a different person then  explain all that said the mock turtle  no no  the adventures first said the gryphon in an impatient tone   explanations take such a dreadful time so alice began telling them her adventures  166  the l0bster  from the time when she first saw the white rabbit she was a little nervous about it just at first the two creatures got so close to her one on each side and opened their eyes and mouths so very wide  but she gained courage as she went on her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about her repeating  you are old father william to the caterpillar and the words all coming different and then the mock turtle drew a long breath and said  thats very curious    it s all about as curious as it can be said the gryphon it all came different the mock turtle repeated thoughtfully  i should like to hear her try and repeat something now tell her to begin he looked at the gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of authority over alice  stand up and repeat   tis the voice of the sluggard  said the gryphon  how the creatures order one about and make  157  quadrille  one repeat lessons   thought alice  i might just as well be at school at once however she got up and began to repeat it but her head was so full of the lobsterquad rille that she hardly knew what she was saying  and the words came very queer indeed   tis the voice of the lobster  i heard him declare  you have baked me too brown i must sugar my hair as a duck with its eyelids so he with his nose trims his belt and his buttons and turns out his toes when the sands are all dry he is gay as a lark and will talk in contemptuous tones of the shark  but when the tide rises and sharks are around his voice has a timid and tremulous sound  158  the l0bster   that s different from what i used to say when i was a child said the gryphon  well i never heard it before said the mock turtle   but it sounds uncommon nonsense alice said nothing  she had sat down with her face in her hands wondering if anything would ever happen in a natural way again  i should like to have it explained said the mock turtle  she cant explain it said the gryphon hastily go on with the next verse but about his toes the mock turtle persisted  how could he turn them out with his nose you know  it s the first position in dancing alice said  but she was dreadfully puzzled by the whole thing and longed to change the subject  go on with the next verse the gryphon repeated   it begins  i passed by his garden  alice did not dare to disobey though she felt sure it would all come wrong and she went on in a trembling voice   quadrille  158    passed by his garden and marked with one eye how the owl and the panther were sharing a pie  the panther took piecrust and gravy and meat while the owl had the dish as its share of the treat when the pie was all finished the owl as a boon was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon while the panther received knife and fork with a growl and concluded the banquet by   what is the use of repeating all that stuff the mock turtle interrupted  if you dont explain it as you go on   it s by far the most confusing  thing i ever heard    yes i think you d better leave off said the gryphon and alice was only too glad to do so  shall we try another figure of the lobsterquadrille   the gryphon went on   or would  you like the mock turtle to sing you another song  oh a song please would be so kind  if the mock turtle  alice replied  so eagerly  160  the lobster  that the gryphon said in a tone  hm   rather  offended  no accounting for tastes   sing  her  turtle soup will you old fellow   the mock turtle sighed deeply and began in a voice choked with sobs to sing this  beautiful soup so rich and green waiting in a hot tureen i who for such dainties would not stoop  soup of the evening beautiful soup i soup of the evening beautiful soup  beauootiful soooop  beauootiful soooop  soooop of the eeevening beautiful beautiful soup   beautiful soup   who cares for fish  game or any other dish who would not give all else for two p ennyworth only of beautiful soup  pennyworth only of beautiful soup t beauootiful soooop beauootiful soooop i  quadrille  161  800oop of the eeevening beautiful beautiful soup  chorus again   cried the gryphon and the mock turtle had just begun to repeat it when a cry of  the trials beginning   was heard in the distance  come on   cried the gryphon and taking alice by the hand it hurried off without wait ing for the end of the song  what trial is it   alice panted as she ran  but the gryphon only answered  come on   and ran the faster while more and more faintly came carried on the breeze that followed them the melancholy words   soooop of the eeevening beautiful beautiful soup  m  chapter xl who stole the tarts  the king and queen of hearts were seated on their throne when they arrived with a great crowd assembled about themall sorts of little birds and beasts as well as the whole pack of cards  the knave was standing before them in chains with a soldier on each side to guard him  and near the king was the white rabbit with a trumpet in one hand and a scroll of parchment in the other in the very middle of the court was a table with a large dish of  who stole the tarts  163  fcarts upon it  they looked so good  that it  made alice quite hungry to look at them i wish theyd get the trial done she thought  and hand round the refreshments    but there  seemed to be no chance of this  so she began looking at everything about her to pass away the time alice had never been in a court of justice before but she had read about them in books and she was quite pleased to find that she knew the name of nearly everything there  thats  the judge she said to herself  because of his great wig the judge by the way was the king  and as he wore his crown over the wig look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it he did not look at all comfortable and it was certainly not becoming  and that s the jurybox thought alice   and those twelve creatures she was obliged to say creatures you see because some of them were animals and some were birds  i m 2  1w  who stole  suppose they are the jurors she said this last word two or three times over to herself being rather proud of it  for she thought and rightly too that very few little girls of her age knew the meaning of it at all however jury men would have done just as well the twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates  what are they doing   alice whispered to the gryphon  they cant have anything to put down yet before the trial s begun  they re putting down their names the gryphon whispered in reply  for fear they should forget them before the end of the trial  stupid things   alice began in a loud indignant voice  but she stopped herself hastily for the white rabbit cried out silence in the court   and the king put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round to make out who was talking alice could see as well as if she were look ing over their shoulders that all the jurors were  the tarts  166  writing down  stupid things   on their slates and she could even make out that one of them didnt know how to spell stupid and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him  a nice muddle their slates ll be in before the trials over   thought alice one of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked this of course alice could not stand and she went round the court and got behind him and very soon found an opportunity of taking it away she did it so quickly that the poor little juror it was bill the lizard could not make out at all what had become of it  so after hunting all about for it he was obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day  and this was of very little use as it left no mark on the slate  herald read the accusation   said the king on this the white rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet and then unrolled the parch mentscroll and read as follows   166  who stole   the queen of hearts she made some tarts all on a summer day  tlie knave of hearts he stole those tarts and took tiiem quite away     consider your verdict the king said to the jury  the tarts  18   not yet not yet   the rabbit hastily in terrupted  there s a great deal to come before that    call the first witness said the king  and the white rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet and called out  first witness   the first witness was the hatter he came in with a teacup in one hand and a piece of breadandbutter in the other  i beg pardon your majesty he began  for bringing these in  but i hadnt quite finished my tea when i was sent for  you ought to have finished said the king  when did you begin   the hatter looked at the march hare who had followed him into the court arminarm with the dormouse  fourteenth of march i think it was he said fifteenth said the march hare  sixteenth said the dormouse  write that down the king said to the jury  and the jury eagerly wrote down all three  168  who stole  dates on their slates and then added them up and reduced the answer to shillings and pence take off your hat the king said to the hatter  it isnt mine said the hatter  stolen   the king exclaimed turning to the jury who instantly made a memorandum of the fact  i keep them to sell the hatter added as an explanation  i ve none of my own i m a hatter here the queen put on her spectacles and began staring hard at the hatter who turned pale and fidgeted  give your evidence said the king   and dont be nervous or i ll have you executed on the spot this did not seem to encourage the witness at all  he kept shifting from one foot to the other looking uneasily at the queen and in his con fusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the breadandbutter  the tarts  169  just at this moment alice felt a very curious sensation which puzzled her a good deal until she made out what it was  she was beginning to grow larger again and she thought at first she would get up and leave the court  but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was as long as there was room for her  i wish you wouldnt squeeze so said the dormouse who was sitting next to her  i can hardly breathe  i cant help it said alice very meekly   im growing  youve no right to grow here said the dor mouse  dont talk nonsense said alice more boldly   you know you re growing too  yes but i grow at a reasonable pace said the dormouse   not in that ridiculous fashion and he got up very sulkily and crossed over to the other side of the court all this time the queen had never left off staring at the hatter and just as the dormouse  170  who stole  crossed the court she said to one of the officers of the court  bring me the list of the singers in the last concert    on which the wretched hatter trembled so that he shook  off both his  shoes  give your evi dence the king re peated angrily   or  i ll have you executed whether you re ner vous or not  i m a poor man your hatter  majesty  the  began in  a  trembling voice  and i hadnt begun my teanot above a week or soand what with the breadandbutter getting so thinand the twinkling of the tea    the twinkling of what said the king  it began with the tea the hatter replied  of course twinkling begins with a t   said  the tarts  171  the king sharply  do you take me for a dunce  go on    i m a poor man the hatter went on  and most things twinkled after thatonly the march hare said  i didnt   the march hare interrupted in a great hurry you did said the hatter  i deny it   said the march hare  he denies it said the king   leave out that part  well at any rate the dormouse said  the hatter went on looking anxiously round to see if he would deny it too  but the dormouse denied nothing being fast asleep  after that continued the hatter  i cut some more breadandbutter   but what did the dormouse say   one of the jury asked that i cant remember said the hatter you must remember remarked the king  or i ll have you executed  172  who stole  the miserable hatter dropped his teacup and breadandbutter and went down on one knee  i m a poor man your majesty he began  you re a very poor speaker said the king here one of the guineapigs cheered and was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court as that is rather a hard word i will just explain to you how it was done they had a large canvas bag which tied up at the mouth with strings  into this they slipped the guineapig head first and then sat upon it  i m glad i ve seen that done thought alice ive so often read in the newspapers at the end of trials  there was some attempt at applause which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court and i never understood what it meant till now  if that s all you know about it you may stand down continued the king  i cant go no lower said the hatter   i m on the floor as it is  then you may sit down the king replied  the tarts  173  here the other guineapig cheered and was suppressed   come that finishes the guineapigs   thought alice  now we shall get on better  i d rather finish my tea said the hatter with an anxious look at the queen who was reading the list of singers  you may go said the king and the hatter hurriedly left the court without even waiting to put his shoes on  and just take his head off outside the  174  who stole  queen added to one of the officers  but the hatter was out of sight before the officer could get to the door  call the next witness   said the king the next witness was the duchesss cook she carried the pepperbox in her hand and alice guessed who it was even before she got into the court by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once  give your evidence said the king  shant said the cook the king looked anxiously at the white rabbit who said in a low voice  your majesty must crossexamine this witness well if i must i must the king said with a melancholy air and after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were nearly out of sight he said in a deep voice what are tarts made of  pepper mostly said the cook  treacle said a sleepy voice behind her  collar that dormouse   the queen shrieked  the tarts  175  out  behead that dormouse  turn that dor mouse out of court  suppress him  pinch him  off with his whiskers   for some minutes the whole court was in confusion getting the dormouse turned out and by the time they had settled down again the cook had disappeared  never mind   said the king with an air of great relief  call the next witness and he added in an undertone to the queen  really my dear you must crossexamine the next witness it quite makes my forehead ache   alice watched the white rabbit as he fumbled over the list feeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like for they havent got much evidence yet she said to herself imagine her surprise when the white rabbit read out at the top of his shrill little voice the name  alice 1  s  chapter xii alices evidence   here   cried alice quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes and she jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jurybox with the edge of her skirt upsetting all the jury men on to the heads of the crowd below and there they lay sprawling about reminding her very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset the week before  oh i beg your pardon   she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay and began picking them up again as quickly as she could for the acci  alices evidence  177  dent of the goldfish kept running in her head and she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once and put back into the jurybox or they would die n  178  alices evidence  the trial cannot proceed said the king in a very grave voice  until all the jurymen are back in their proper placesall he repeated with great emphasis looking hard at alice as he said so alice looked at the jurybox and saw that in her haste she had put the lizard in head downwards and the poor little thing was waving its tail about in a melancholy way being quite unable to move she soon got it out again and put it right   not that it signifies much she said to herself i should think it would be quite as much use in the trial one way up as the other as soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being upset and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to them they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the accident all except the lizard who seemed too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open gazing up into the roof of the court  alices evidence  179  what do you know about this business the king said to alice nothing said alice nothing whatever persisted the king nothing whatever said alice  that s very important the king said turn ing to the jury they were just beginning to write this down on their slates when the white rabbit interrupted   z7wimportant your majesty means of course he said in a very respectful tone but frowning and making faces at him as he spoke  unimportant of course i meant the king hastily said and went on to himself in an under tone  importantunimportant unimportant important  as if he were trying which word sounded best some of the jury wrote it down  important and some  unimportant alice could see this as she was near enough to look over their slates   but it doesnt matter a bit she thought to herself n2  180  alices evidence  at this moment the king who had been for some time busily writing in his notebook called out  silence   and read out from his book rule fortytwo all persons more than a mile high to leave the court everybody looked at alice  im not a mile high said alice you are said the king  nearly two miles high added the queen  well i shant go at any rate said alice   besides that s not a regular rule  you invented it just now  it s the oldest rule in the book said the king  then it ought to be number one said alice the king turned pale and shut his note book hastily  consider your verdict he said to the jury in a low trembling voice theres more evidence to come yet please your majesty said the white rabbit jumping up in a great hurry   this paper has just been picked up  alices evidence  181   what s in it   said the queen  i havent opened it yet said the white rabbit   but it seems to be a letter written by the prisoner toto somebody  it must have been that said the king  unless it was written to nobody which isnt usual you know  who is it directed to   said one of the jurymen it isnt directed at all said the white rabbit  in fact there s nothing written on the outside he unfolded the paper as he spoke and added  it isnt a letter after all  it s a set of verses  are they in the prisoners handwriting   asked another of the jurymen no theyre not said the white rabbit and thats the queerest thing about it the jury all looked puzzled  he must have imitated somebody elses hand said the king the jury all brightened up again  182  alices evidence   please your majesty said the knave  i didnt write it and they cant prove that i did  there s no name signed at the end  if you didnt sign it said the king  that only makes the matter worse you must have meant some mischief or else youd have signed your name like an honest man there was a general clapping of hands at this  it was the first really clever thing the king had said that day  that proves his guilt of course said the queen   so off with   it doesnt prove anything of the sort   said alice  why you dont even know what they re about    read them said the king the white rabbit put on his spectacles  where shall i begin please your majesty   he asked  begin at the beginning the king said very gravely  and go on till you come to the end  then stop  alices evidence  183  there was dead silence in the court whilst the white rabbit read out these verses    they told me you had been to her and mentioned me to him she gave me a good character but said i could not swim  he sent them word i had not gone we know it to be true if she should push the matter on what would become of you   i gave her one they gave him two you gave us three or more they all returned from him to you though they were mine before  if i or she should chance to be involved in this affair he trusts to you to set them free exactly as we were  184  alices evidence  my notion was that you had been before she had this fit an obstacle that came between him and ourselves and it dont let him know she liked them best for this must ever be a secret kept from all the rest between yourself and me   that s the most important piece of evidence we ve heard yet said the king rubbing hands   so now let the jury  his     if any one of them can explain it said alice she had grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasnt a bit afraid of inter rupting him  1 11 give him sixpence  i dont  believe theres an atom of meaning in it the jury all wrote down on their slates  she doesnt believe there s an atom of meaning in it but none of them attempted to explain the paper  alices evidence  185   if there s no meaning in it said the king  that saves a world of trouble you know as we neednt try to find any and yet i dont know he went on spreading out the verses on his knee and looking at them with one eye  i seem to see some meaning in them after all  said i could not swim  you cant swim can you   he added turning to the knave the knave shook his head sadly do i look like it   he said which he certainly did not being made entirely of cardboard all right so far said the king and he went on muttering over the verses to himself    we know it to be true that s the jury of course if she should push the matter on  that must be the queen what would become of you  what indeed   gave her one they gave him two why that must be what he did with the tarts you know   but it goes on  they all returned from him to you  said alice  186  alices evidence    why  are    there  they  the  king  said  triumphantly  pointing  to  on  the  table  tarts  the   nothing can be  clearer than that  then  again before she had this  fit you  had fits  never  my dear  i  think   he said to the queen  never   said the  queen furiously throw  ing an inkstand at the lizard as she spoke the unfortunate little bill had left off writing on his slate with one finger as he found it made    alices evidence  w  no mark  but he now hastily began again using the ink that was trickling down his face as long as it lasted then the words dont fit you said the king looking round the court with a smile there was a dead silence  it s a pun   the king added in an angry tone and everybody laughed   let the jury  consider their verdict the king said for about the twentieth time that day  no no   said the queen   sentence first  verdict afterwards  stuff and nonsense   said alice loudly   the  idea of having the sentence first    hold your tongue   said the queen turn ing purple  i wont   said alice  off with her head   the queen shouted at the top of her voice  nobody moved   who cares for you   said alice she had grown to her full size by this time nothing but a pack of cards i   youre  188  alices evidence  at this the whole pack rose up into the air 1 came flying down upon her she gave a  alices evidence  189  little scream half of fright and half of anger and tried to beat them off and found herself lying on the bank with her head in the lap of her sister who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face  wake up alice dear   said her sister  why what a long sleep you ve had    oh i ve had such a curious dream   said alice and she told her sister as well as she could remember them all these strange adven tures of hers that you have just been reading about  and when she had finished her sister kissed her and said  it was a curious dream dear certainly  but now run in to your tea  its getting late so alice got up and ran off thinking while she ran as well she might what a wonderful dream it had been  190  but her sister sat still just as she left her leaning her head on her hand watching the setting sun and thinking of little alice and all her wonderful adventures till she too began dreaming after a fashion and this was her dream  first she dreamed about little alice herself  once again the tiny hands were clasped upon her knee and the bright eager eyes were look ing up into hersshe could hear the very tones of her voice and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that would always get into her eyesand still as she listened or seemed to listen the whole place around her became alive with the strange creatures of her little sisters dream  191  the long grass rustled at her feet as the white rabbit hurried bythe frightened mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool she could hear the rattle of the teacups as the march hare and his friends shared their neverending meal and the shrill voice of the queen ordering off her unfortunate guests to executiononce more the pigbaby was sneezing on the duchess knee while plates and dishes crashed around itonce more the shriek of the gryphon the squeaking of the lizards slatepencil and the choking of the suppressed guineapigs filled the air mixed up with the distant sob of the miserable mock turtle so she sat on with closed eyes and half believed herself in wonderland though she knew she had but to open them again and all would change to dull realitythe grass would be only rustling in the wind and the pool rip pling to the waving of the reedsthe rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheepbells and the queens shrill cries to the voice of the  192  shepherdboyand the sneeze of the baby the shriek of the gryphon and all the other queer noises would change she knew to the con fused clamour of the busy farmyardwhile the lowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the mock turtles heavy sobs lastly she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers would in the aftertime be herself a grown woman  and how she would keep through all her riper years the simple and loving heart of her childhood  and how she would gather about her other little children and make their eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale perhaps even with the dream of wonderland of long ago  and how she would feel with all their simple sorrows and find a pleasure in all their simple joys remembering her own childlife and the happy summer days the end  printed in the united states of america  life histories of  american insects by
