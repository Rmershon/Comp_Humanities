                 meditations on first philosophy                          rene descartes                               1641  copyright 1996 internet encyclopedia of philosophy this file is of the 1911 edition of the philosophical works of descartes cambridge university press translated by elizabeth s haldane1                prefatory note to the meditations       the first edition of the meditations was published in latin by michael soly of paris at the sign of the phoenix in 1641 cum privilegio et approbatione doctorum  the royal privilege was indeed given but the approbation seems to have been of a most indefinite kind  the reason of the book being published in france and not in holland where descartes was living in a charming country house at endegeest near leiden was apparently his fear that the dutch ministers might in some way lay hold of it  his friend pere mersenne took charge of its publication in paris and wrote to him about any difficulties that occurred in the course of its progress through the press  the second edition was however published at amsterdam in 1642 by louis elzevir and this edition was accompanied by the now completed objections and replies2 the edition from which the present translation is made is the second just mentioned and is that adopted by mm adam and tannery as the more correct for reasons that they state in detail in the preface to their edition  the work was translated into french by the duc de luynes in 1642 and descartes considered the translation so excellent that he had it published some years later  clerselier to complete matters had the objections also published in french with the replies and this like the other was subject to descartes revision and correction  this revision renders the french edition specially valuable  where it seems desirable an alternative reading from the french is given in square brackets                       elizabeth s haldane               to the most wise and illustrious the                  dean and doctors of the sacred                  faculty of theology in paris       the motive which induces me to present to you this treatise is so excellent and when you become acquainted with its design i am convinced that you will also have so excellent a motive for taking it under your protection that i feel that i cannot do better in order to render it in some sort acceptable to you than in a few words to state what i have set myself to do       i have always considered that the two questions respecting god and the soul were the chief of those that ought to be demonstrated by philosophical rather than theological argument  for although it is quite enough for us faithful ones to accept by means of faith the fact that the human soul does not perish with the body and that god exists it certainly does not seem possible ever to persuade infidels of any religion indeed we may almost say of any moral virtue unless to begin with we prove these two facts by means of the natural reason  and inasmuch as often in this life greater rewards are offered for vice than for virtue few people would prefer the right to the useful were they restrained neither by the fear of god nor the expectation of another life and although it is absolutely true that we must believe that there is a god because we are so taught in the holy scriptures and on the other hand that we must believe the holy scriptures because they come from god the reason of this is that faith being a gift of god he who gives the grace to cause us to believe other things can likewise give it to cause us to believe that he exists we nevertheless could not place this argument before infidels who might accuse us of reasoning in a circle  and in truth i have noticed that you along with all the theologians did not only affirm that the existence of god may be proved by the natural reason but also that it may be inferred from the holy scriptures that knowledge about him is much clearer than that which we have of many created things and as a matter of fact is so easy to acquire that those who have it not are culpable in their ignorance  this indeed appears from the wisdom of solomon chapter xiii where it is said howbeit they are not to be excused for if their understanding was so great that they could discern the world and the creatures why did they not rather find out the lord thereof  and in romans chapter i it is said that they are without excuse and again in the same place by these words that which may be known of god is manifest in them it seems as through we were shown that all that which can be known of god may be made manifest by means which are not derived from anywhere but from ourselves and from the simple consideration of the nature of our minds hence i thought it not beside my purpose to inquire how this is so and how god may be more easily and certainly known than the things of the world       and as regards the soul although many have considered that it is not easy to know its nature and some have even dared to say that human reasons have convinced us that it would perish with the body and that faith alone could believe the contrary nevertheless inasmuch as the lateran council held under leo x in the eighth session condemns these tenets and as leo expressly ordains christian philosophers to refute their arguments and to employ all their powers in making known the truth i have ventured in this treatise to undertake the same task       more than that i am aware that the principal reason which causes many impious persons not to desire to believe that there is a god and that the human soul is distinct from the body is that they declare that hitherto no one has been able to demonstrate these two facts and although i am not of their opinion but on the contrary hold that the greater part of the reasons which have been brought forward concerning these two questions by so many great men are when they are rightly understood equal to so many demonstrations and that it is almost impossible to invent new ones it is yet in my opinion the case that nothing more useful can be accomplished in philosophy than once for all to seek with care for the best of these reasons and to set them forth in so clear and exact a manner that it will henceforth be evident to everybody that they are veritable demonstrations  and finally inasmuch as it was desired that i should undertake this task by many who were aware that i had cultivated a certain method for the resolution of difficulties of every kind in the sciences a method which it is true is not novel since there is nothing more ancient than the truth but of which they were aware that i had made use successfully enough in other matters of difficulty i have thought that it was my duty also to make trial of it in the present matter       now all that i could accomplish in the matter is contained in this treatise  not that i have here drawn together all the different reasons which might be brought forward to serve as proofs of this subject  for that never seemed to be necessary excepting when there was no one single proof that was certain  but i have treated the first and principal ones in such a manner that i can venture to bring them forward as very evident and very certain demonstrations and more than that i will say that these proofs are such that i do not think that there is any way open to the human mind by which it can ever succeed in discovering better  for the importance of the subject and the glory of god to which all this relates constrain me to speak here somewhat more freely of myself than is my habit  nevertheless whatever certainty and evidence i find in my reasons i cannot persuade myself that all the world is capable of understanding them  still just as in geometry there are many demonstrations that have been left to us by archimedes by apollonius by pappus and others which are accepted by everyone as perfectly certain and evident because they clearly contain nothing which considered by itself is not very easy to understand and as all through that which follows has an exact connection with and dependence on that which precedes nevertheless because they are somewhat lengthy and demand a mind wholly devoted tot heir consideration they are only taken in and understood by a very limited number of persons  similarly although i judge that those of which i here make use are equal to or even surpass in certainty and evidence the demonstrations of geometry i yet apprehend that they cannot be adequately understood by many both because they are also a little lengthy and dependent the one on the other and principally because they demand a mind wholly free of prejudices and one which can be easily detached from the affairs of the senses and truth to say there are not so many in the world who are fitted for metaphysical speculations as there are for those of geometry  and more than that there is still this difference that in geometry since each one is persuaded that nothing must be advanced of which there is not a certain demonstration those who are not entirely adepts more frequently err in approving what is false in order to give the impression that they understand it than in refuting the true  but the case is different in philosophy where everyone believes that all is problematical and few give themselves to the search after truth and the greater number in their desire to acquire a reputation for boldness of thought arrogantly combat the most important of truths3        that is why whatever force there may be in my reasonings seeing they belong to philosophy i cannot hope that they will have much effect on the minds of men unless you extend to them your protection  but the estimation in which you company is universally held is so great and the name of sorbonne carries with it so much authority that next to the sacred councils never has such deference been paid to the judgment of any body not only in what concerns the faith but also in what regards human philosophy as well  everyone indeed believes that it is not possible to discover elsewhere more perspicacity and solidity or more integrity and wisdom in pronouncing judgment  for this reason i have no doubt that if you deign to take the trouble in the first place of correcting this work for being conscious not only of my infirmity but also of my ignorance i should not dare to state that it was free from errors and then after adding to it these things that are lacking to it completing those which are imperfect and yourselves taking the trouble to give a more ample explanation of those things which have need of it or at least making me aware of the defects so that i may apply myself to remedy them4  when this is done and when finally the reasonings by which i prove that there is a god and that the human soul differs from the body shall be carried to that point of perspicuity to which i am sure they can be carried in order that they may be esteemed as perfectly exact demonstrations if you deign to authorize your approbation and to render public testimony to their truth and certainty i do not doubt i say that henceforward all the errors and false opinions which have ever existed regarding these two questions will soon be effaced from the minds of men  for the truth itself will easily cause all men of mind and learning to subscribe to your judgment and your authority will cause the atheists who are usually more arrogant than learned or judicious to rid themselves of their spirit of contradiction or lead them possibly themselves to defend the reasonings which they find being received as demonstrations by all persons of consideration lest they appear not to understand them  and finally all others will easily yield to such a mass of evidence and there will be none who dares to doubt the existence of god and the real and true distinction between the human soul and the body  it is for you now in your singular wisdom to judge of the importance of the establishment of such beliefs you who see the disorders produced by the doubt of them5   but it would not become me to say more in consideration of the cause of god and religion to those who have always been the most worthy supports of the catholic church                             preface to the reader              i have already slightly touched on these two questions of god and the human soul in the discourse on the method of rightly conducting the reason and seeking truth in the sciences published in french in the year 1637  not that i had the design of treating these with any thoroughness but only so to speak in passing and in order to ascertain by the judgment of the readers how i should treat them later on  for these questions have always appeared to me to be of such importance that i judged it suitable to speak of them more than once and the road which i follow in the explanation of them is so little trodden and so far removed from the ordinary path that i did not judge it to be expedient to set it forth at length in french and in a discourse which might be read by everyone in case the feebler minds should believe that it was permitted to them to attempt to follow the same path       but having in this discourse on method begged all those who have found in my writings somewhat deserving of censure to do me the favour of acquainting me with the grounds of it nothing worthy of remark has been objected to in them beyond two matters  to these two i wish here to reply in a few words before undertaking their more detailed discussion       the first objection is that it does not follow from the fact that the human mind reflecting on itself does not perceive itself to be other than a thing that thinks that its nature or its essence consists only in its being a thing that thinks in the sense that this word only excludes all other things which might also be supposed to pertain to the nature of the soul  to this objection i reply that it was not my intention in that place to exclude these in accordance with the order that looks to the truth of the matter as to which i was not then dealing but only in accordance with the order of my thought perception thus my meaning was that so far as i was aware i knew nothing clearly as belonging to my essence excepting that i was a thing that thinks or a thing that has in itself the faculty of thinking  but i shall show hereafter how from the fact that i know no other thing which pertains to my essence it follows that there is no other thing which really does belong to it       the second objection is that it does not follow from the fact that i have in myself the idea of something more perfect than i am that this idea is more perfect than i and much less that what is represented by this idea exists  but i reply that in this term idea there is here something equivocal for it may either be taken materially as an act of my understanding and in this sense it cannot be said that it is more perfect than i or it may be taken objectively as the thing which is represented by this act which although we do not suppose it to exist outside of my understanding may none the less be more perfect than i because of its essence  and in following out this treatise i shall show more fully how from the sole fact that i have in myself the idea of a thing more perfect than myself it follows that this thing truly exists       in addition to these two objections i have also seen two fairly lengthy works on this subject which however did not so much impugn my reasonings as my conclusions and this by arguments drawn from the ordinary atheistic sources  but because such arguments cannot make any impression on the minds of those who really understand my reasonings and as the judgments of many are so feeble and irrational that they very often allow themselves to be persuaded by the opinions which they have first formed however false and far removed from reason they may be rather than by a true and solid but subsequently received refutation of these opinions i do not desire to reply here to their criticisms in case of being first of all obliged to state them  i shall only say in general that all that is said by the atheist against the existence of god always depends either on the fact that we ascribe to god affections which are human or that we attribute so much strength and wisdom to our minds that we even have the presumption to desire to determine and understand that which god can and ought to do  in this way all that they allege will cause us no difficulty provided only we remember that we must consider our minds as things which are finite and limited and god as a being who is incomprehensible and infinite       now that i have once for all recognised and acknowledged the opinions of men i at once begin to treat of god and the human soul and at the same time to treat of the whole of the first philosophy without however expecting any praise from the vulgar and without the hope that my book will have many readers  on the contrary i should never advise anyone to read it excepting those who desire to meditate seriously with me and who can detach their minds from affairs of sense and deliver themselves entirely from every sort of prejudice  i know too well that such men exist in a very small number  but for those who without caring to comprehend the order and connections of my reasonings form their criticisms on detached portions arbitrarily selected as is the custom with many these i say will not obtain much profit from reading this treatise  and although they perhaps in several parts find occasion of cavilling they can for all their pains make no objection which is urgent or deserving of reply       and inasmuch as i make no promise to others to satisfy them at once and as i do not presume so much on my own powers as to believe myself capable of foreseeing all that can cause difficulty to anyone i shall first of all set forth in these meditations the very considerations by which i persuade myself that i have reached a certain and evident knowledge of the truth in order to see if by the same reasons which persuaded me i can also persuade others  and after that i shall reply to the objections which have been made to me by persons of genius and learning to whom i have sent my meditations for examination before submitting them to the press  for they have made so many objections and these so different that i venture to promise that it will be difficult for anyone to bring to mind criticisms of any consequence which have not been already touched upon  this is why i beg those who read these meditations to form no judgment upon them unless they have given themselves the trouble to read all the objections as well as the replies which i have made to them6            synopsis of the six following meditations              in the first meditation i set forth the reasons for which we may generally speaking doubt about all things and especially about material things at least so long as we have no other foundations for the sciences than those which we have hitherto possessed  but although the utility of a doubt which is so general does not at first appear it is at the same time very great inasmuch as it delivers us from every kind of prejudice and sets out for us a very simple way by which the mind may detach itself from the senses and finally it makes it impossible for us ever to doubt those things which we have once discovered to be true       in the second meditation mind which making use of the liberty which pertains to it takes for granted that all those things of whose existence it has the least doubt are non existent recognises that it is however absolutely impossible that it does not itself exist  this point is likewise of the greatest moment inasmuch as by this means a distinction is easily drawn between the things which pertain to mind that is to say to the intellectual nature and those which pertain to body       but because it may be that some expect from me in this place a statement of the reasons establishing the immortality of the soul i feel that i should here make known to them that having aimed at writing nothing in all this treatise of which i do not possess very exact demonstrations i am obliged to follow a similar order to that made use of by the geometers which is to begin by putting forward as premises all those things upon which the proposition that we seek depends before coming to any conclusion regarding it  now the first and principal matter which is requisite for thoroughly understanding the immortality of the soul is to form the clearest possible conception of it and one which will be entirely distinct from all the conceptions which we may have of body and in this meditation this has been done  in addition to this it is requisite that we may be assured that all the things which we conceive clearly and distinctly are true in the very way in which we think them and this could not be proved previously to the fourth mediation  further we must have a distinct conception of corporeal nature which is given partly in this second and partly in the fifth and sixth meditations  and finally we should conclude from all this that those things which we conceive clearly and distinctly as being diverse substances as we regard mind and body to be are really substances essentially distinct one from the other and this is the conclusion of the sixth meditation  this is further confirmed in this same meditation by the fact that we cannot conceive of body excepting in so far as it is divisible while the mind cannot be conceived of excepting as indivisible  for we are not able to conceive of the half of a mind as we can do of the smallest of all bodies so that we see that not only are their natures different but even in some respects contrary to one another  i have not however dealt further with this matter in this treatise both because what i have said is sufficient to show clearly enough that the extinction of the mind does not follow from the corruption of the body and also to give men the hope of another life after death as also because the premises from which the immortality of the soul may be deduced depend on an elucidation of a complete system of physics  this would mean to establish in the first place that all substances generally that is to say all things which cannot exist without being created by god are in their nature incorruptible and that they can never cease to exist unless god in denying to them his concurrence reduce them to nought and secondly that body regarded generally is a substance which is the reason why it also cannot perish but that the human body inasmuch as it differs from other bodies is composed only of a certain configuration of members and of other similar accidents while the human mind is not similarly composed of any accidents but is a pure substance  for although all the accidents of mind be changed although for instance it think certain things will others perceive others etc despite all this it does not emerge from these changes another mind  the human body on the other hand becomes a different thing from the sole fact that the figure or form of any of its portions is found to be changed from this it follows that the human body may indeed easily enough perish but the mind or soul of man i make no distinction between them is owing to its nature immortal       in the third meditation it seems to me that i have explained at sufficient length the principal argument of which i make use in order to prove the existence of god  but none the less because i did not wish in that place to make use of any comparisons derived from corporeal things so as to withdraw as much as i could the minds of readers from the senses there may perhaps have remained many obscurities which however will i hope be entirely removed by the replies which i have made to the objections which have been set before me  amongst others there is for example this one how the idea in us of a being supremely perfect possesses so much objective reality that is to say participates by representation in so many degrees of being and perfection that it necessarily proceeds from a cause which is absolutely perfect  this is illustrated in these replies by the comparison of a very perfect machine the idea of which is found in the mind of some workman  for as the objective contrivance of this idea must have some cause ie either the science of the workman or that of some other from whom he has received the idea it is similarly impossible that the idea of god which is in us should not have god himself as its cause       in the fourth meditation it is shown that all these things which we very clearly and distinctly perceive are true and at the same time it is explained in what the nature of error or falsity consists  this must of necessity be known both for the confirmation of the preceding truths and for the better comprehension of those that follow  but it must meanwhile be remarked that i do not in any way there treat of sin that is to say of the error which is committed in the pursuit of good and evil but only of that which arises in the deciding between the true and the false  and i do not intend to speak of matters pertaining to the faith or the conduct of life but only of those which concern speculative truths and which may be known by the sole aid of the light of nature       in the fifth meditation corporeal nature generally is explained and in addition to this the existence of god is demonstrated by a new proof in which there may possibly be certain difficulties also but the solution of these will be seen in the replies to the objections  and further i show in what sense it is true to say that the certainty of geometrical demonstrations is itself dependent on the knowledge of god       finally in the sixth i distinguish the action of the understanding7 from that of the imagination8 the marks by which this distinction is made are described  i here show that the mind of man is really distinct from the body and at the same time that the two are so closely joined together that they form so to speak a single thing  all the errors which proceed from the senses are then surveyed while the means of avoiding them are demonstrated and finally all the reasons from which we may deduce the existence of material things are set forth  not that i judge them to be very useful in establishing that which they prove to wit that there is in truth a world that men possess bodies and other such things which never have been doubted by anyone of sense but because in considering these closely we come to see that they are neither so strong nor so evident as those arguments which lead us to the knowledge of our mind and of god so that these last must be the most certain and most evident facts which can fall within the cognizance of the human mind  and this is the whole matter that i have tried to prove in these meditations for which reason i here omit to speak of many other questions which i dealt incidentally in this discussion                      meditations on the first philosophy                  in which the existence of god                 and the distinction between mind                   and body are demonstrated9                                                             meditation i                                      of the things which may be brought within the sphere of the                            doubtful                                        it is now some years since i detected how many were the false beliefs that i had from my earliest youth admitted as true and how doubtful was everything i had since constructed on this basis and from that time i was convinced that i must once for all seriously undertake to rid myself of all the opinions which i had formerly accepted and commence to build anew from the foundation if i wanted to establish any firm and permanent structure in the sciences  but as this enterprise appeared to be a very great one i waited until i had attained an age so mature that i could not hope that at any later date i should be better fitted to execute my design this reason caused me to delay so long that i should feel that i was doing wrong were i to occupy in deliberation the time that yet remains to me for action  today then since very opportunely for the plan i have in view i have delivered my mind from every care and am happily agitated by no passions and since i have procured for myself an assured leisure in a peaceable retirement i shall at last seriously and freely address myself to the general upheaval of all my former opinions       now for this object it is not necessary that i should show that all of these are false i shall perhaps never arrive at this end  but inasmuch as reason already persuades me that i ought no less carefully to withhold my assent from matters which are not entirely certain and indubitable than from those which appear to me manifestly to be false if i am able to find in each one some reason to doubt this will suffice to justify my rejecting the whole  and for that end it will not be requisite that i should examine each in particular which would be an endless undertaking for owing to the fact that the destruction of the foundations of necessity brings with it the downfall of the rest of the edifice i shall only in the first place attack those principles upon which all my former opinions rested       all that up to the present time i have accepted as most true and certain i have learned either from the senses or through the senses but it is sometimes proved to me that these senses are deceptive and it is wiser not to trust entirely to anything by which we have once been deceived       but it may be that although the senses sometimes deceive us concerning things which are hardly perceptible or very far away there are yet many others to be met with as to which we cannot reasonably have any doubt although we recognise them by their means  for example there is the fact that i am here seated by the fire attired in a dressing gown having this paper in my hands and other similar matters  and how could i deny that these hands and this body are mine were it not perhaps that i compare myself to certain persons devoid of sense whose cerebella are so troubled and clouded by the violent vapours of black bile that they constantly assure us that they think they are kings when they are really quite poor or that they are clothed in purple when they are really without covering or who imagine that they have an earthenware head or are nothing but pumpkins or are made of glass  but they are mad and i should not be any the less insane were i to follow examples so extravagant       at the same time i must remember that i am a man and that consequently i am in the habit of sleeping and in my dreams representing to myself the same things or sometimes even less probable things than do those who are insane in their waking moments  how often has it happened to me that in the night i dreamt that i found myself in this particular place that i was dressed and seated near the fire whilst in reality i was lying undressed in bed  at this moment it does indeed seem to me that it is with eyes awake that i am looking at this paper that this head which i move is not asleep that it is deliberately and of set purpose that i extend my hand and perceive it what happens in sleep does not appear so clear nor so distinct as does all this  but in thinking over this i remind myself that on many occasions i have in sleep been deceived by similar illusions and in dwelling carefully on this reflection i see so manifestly that there are no certain indications by which we may clearly distinguish wakefulness from sleep that i am lost in astonishment  and my astonishment is such that it is almost capable of persuading me that i now dream       now let us assume that we are asleep and that all these particulars eg that we open our eyes shake our head extend our hands and so on are but false delusions and let us reflect that possibly neither our hands nor our whole body are such as they appear to us to be  at the same time we must at least confess that the things which are represented to us in sleep are like painted representations which can only have been formed as the counterparts of something real and true and that in this way those general things at least ie eyes a head hands and a whole body are not imaginary things but things really existent  for as a matter of fact painters even when they study with the greatest skill to represent sirens and satyrs by forms the most strange and extraordinary cannot give them natures which are entirely new but merely make a certain medley of the members of different animals or if their imagination is extravagant enough to invent something so novel that nothing similar has ever before been seen and that then their work represents a thing purely fictitious and absolutely false it is certain all the same that the colours of which  this is composed are necessarily real  and for the same reason although these general things to with a body eyes a head hands and such like may be imaginary we are bound at the same time to confess that there are at least some other objects yet more simple and more universal which are real and true and of these just in the same way as with certain real colours all these images of things which dwell in our thoughts whether true and real or false and fantastic are formed       to such a class of things pertains corporeal nature in general and its extension the figure of extended things their quantity or magnitude and number as also the place in which they are the time which measures their duration and so on       that is possibly why our reasoning is not unjust when we conclude from this that physics astronomy medicine and all other sciences which have as their end the consideration of composite things are very dubious and uncertain but that arithmetic geometry and other sciences of that kind which only treat of things that are very simple and very general without taking great trouble to ascertain whether they are actually existent or not contain some measure of certainty and an element of the indubitable  for whether i am awake or asleep two and three together always form five and the square can never have more than four sides and it does not seem possible that truths so clear and apparent can be suspected of any falsity or uncertainty       nevertheless i have long had fixed in my mind the belief that an allpowerful god existed by whom i have been created such as i am  but how do i know that he has not brought it to pass that there is no earth no heaven no extended body no magnitude no place and that nevertheless i possess the perceptions of all these things and that they seem to me to exist just exactly as i now see them  and besides as i sometimes imagine that others deceive themselves in the things which they think they know best how do i know that i am not deceived every time that i add two and three or count the sides of a square or judge of things yet simpler if anything simpler can be imagined  but possibly god has not desired that i should be thus deceived for he is said to be supremely good  if however it is contrary to his goodness to have made me such that i constantly deceive myself it would also appear to be contrary to his goodness to permit me to be sometimes deceived and nevertheless i cannot doubt that he does permit this       there may indeed be those who would prefer to deny the existence of a god so powerful rather than believe that all other things are uncertain  but let us not oppose them for the present and grant that all that is here said of a god is a fable nevertheless in whatever way they suppose that i have arrived at the state of being that i have reached whether they attribute it to fate or to accident or make out that it is by a continual succession of antecedents or by some other method since to err and deceive oneself is a defect it is clear that the greater will be the probability of my being so imperfect as to deceive myself ever as is the author to whom they assign my origin the less powerful  to these reasons i have certainly nothing to reply but at the end i feel constrained to confess that there is nothing in all that i formerly believed to be true of which i cannot in some measure doubt and that not merely through want of thought or through levity but for reasons which are very powerful and maturely considered so that henceforth i ought not the less carefully to refrain from giving credence to these opinions than to that which is manifestly false if i desire to arrive at any certainty in the sciences       but it is not sufficient to have made these remarks we must also be careful to keep them in mind  for these ancient and commonly held opinions still revert frequently to my mind long and familiar custom having given them the right to occupy my mind against my inclination and rendered them almost masters of my belief nor will i ever lose the habit of deferring to them or of placing my confidence in them so long as i consider them as they really are ie opinions in some measure doubtful as i have just shown and at the same time highly probable so that there is much more reason to believe in than to deny them  that is why i consider that i shall not be acting amiss if taking of set purpose a contrary belief i allow myself to be deceived and for a certain time pretend that all these opinions are entirely false and imaginary until at last having thus balanced my former prejudices with my latter so that they cannot divert my opinions more to one side than to the other my judgment will no longer be dominated by bad usage or turned away from the right knowledge of the truth  for i am assured that there can be neither peril nor error in this course and that i cannot at present yield too much to distrust since i am not considering the question of action but only of knowledge       i shall then suppose not that god who is supremely good and the fountain of truth but some evil genius not less powerful than deceitful has employed his whole energies in deceiving me i shall consider that the heavens the earth colours figures sound and all other external things are nought but the illusions and dreams of which this genius has availed himself in order to lay traps for my credulity i shall consider myself as having no hands no eyes no flesh no blood nor any senses yet falsely believing myself to possess all these things i shall remain obstinately attached to this idea and if by this means it is not in my power to arrive at the knowledge of any truth i may at least do what is in my power ie suspend my judgment and with firm purpose avoid giving credence to any false thing or being imposed upon by this arch deceiver however powerful and deceptive he may be  but this task is a laborious one and insensibly a certain lassitude leads me into the course of my ordinary life  and just as a captive who in sleep enjoys an imaginary liberty when he begins to suspect that his liberty is but a dream fears to awaken and conspires with these agreeable illusions that the deception may be prolonged so insensibly of my own accord i fall back into my former opinions and i dread awakening from this slumber lest the laborious wakefulness which would follow the tranquillity of this repose should have to be spent not in daylight but in the excessive darkness of the difficulties which have just been discussed                                 meditation ii                                      of the nature of the human mind and that it is more easily                       known than the body                                        the meditation of yesterday filled my mind with so many doubts that it is no longer in my power to forget them  and yet i do not see in what manner i can resolve them and just as if i had all of a sudden fallen into very deep water i am so disconcerted that i can neither make certain of setting my feet on the bottom nor can i swim and so support myself on the surface  i shall nevertheless make an effort and follow anew the same path as that on which i yesterday entered ie i shall proceed by setting aside all that in which the least doubt could be supposed to exist just as if i had discovered that it was absolutely false and i shall ever follow in this road until i have met with something which is certain or at least if i can do nothing else until i have learned for certain that there is nothing in the world that is certain archimedes in order that he might draw the terrestrial globe out of its place and transport it elsewhere demanded only that one point should be fixed and immoveable in the same way i shall have the right to conceive high hopes if i am happy enough to discover one thing only which is certain and indubitable       i suppose then that all the things that i see are false i persuade myself that nothing has ever existed of all that my fallacious memory represents to me  i consider that i possess no senses i imagine that body figure extension movement and place are but the fictions of my mind  what then can be esteemed as true  perhaps nothing at all unless that there is nothing in the world that is certain       but how can i know there is not something different from those things that i have just considered of which one cannot have the slightest doubt  is there not some god or some other being by whatever name we call it who puts these reflections into my mind  that is not necessary for is it not possible that i am capable of producing them myself  i myself am i not at least something  but i have already denied that i had senses and body  yet i hesitate for what follows from that  am i so dependent on body and senses that i cannot exist without these  but i was persuaded that there was nothing in all the world that there was no heaven no earth that there were no minds nor any bodies  was i not then likewise persuaded that i did not exist  not at all of a surety i myself did exist since i persuaded myself of something or merely because i thought of something  but there is some deceiver or other very powerful and very cunning who ever employs his ingenuity in deceiving me  then without doubt i exist also if he deceives me and let him deceive me as much as he will he can never cause me to be nothing so long as i think that i am something  so that after having reflected well and carefully examined all things we must come to the definite conclusion that this proposition  i am i exist is necessarily true each time that i pronounce it or that i mentally conceive it       but i do not yet know clearly enough what i am i who am certain that i am and hence i must be careful to see that i do not imprudently take some other object in place of myself and thus that i do not go astray in respect of this knowledge that i hold to be the most certain and most evident of all that i have formerly learned  that is why i shall now consider anew what i believed myself to be before i embarked upon these last reflections and of my former opinions i shall withdraw all that might even in a small degree be invalidated by the reasons which i have just brought forward in order that there may be nothing at all left beyond what is absolutely certain and indubitable       what then did i formerly believe myself to be undoubtedly i believed myself to be a man  but what is a man shall i say a reasonable animal  certainly not for then i should have to inquire what an animal is and what is reasonable and thus from a single question i should insensibly fall into an infinitude of others more difficult and i should not wish to waste the little time and leisure remaining to me in trying to unravel subtleties like these but i shall rather stop here to consider the thoughts which of themselves spring up in my mind and which were not inspired by anything beyond my own nature alone when i applied myself to the consideration of my being  in the first place the i considered myself as having a face hands arms and all that system of members composed on bones and flesh as seen in a corpse which i designated by the name of body  in addition to this i considered that i was nourished that i walked that i felt and that i thought and i referred all these actions to the soul  but i did not stop to consider what the soul was or if i did stop i imagined that it was something extremely rare and subtle like a wind a flame or an ether which was spread throughout my grosser parts  as to body i had no manner of doubt about its nature but thought i had a very clear knowledge of it and if i had desired to explain it according to the notions that i had then formed of it i should have described it thus  by the body i understand all that which can be defined by a certain figure  something which can be confined in a certain place and which can fill a given space in such a way that every other body will be excluded from it which can be perceived either by tough or by sight or by hearing or by taste or by smell  which can be moved in many ways not in truth by itself but by something which is foreign to it by which it is touched and from which it receives impressions  for to have the power of selfmovement as also of feeling or of thinking i did not consider to appertain to the nature of body  on the contrary i was rather astonished to find that faculties similar to them existed in some bodies       but what am i now that i suppose that there is a certain genius which is extremely powerful and if i may say so malicious who employs all his powers in deceiving me  can i affirm that i possess the least of all those things which i have just said pertain to the nature of body  i pause to consider i revolve all these things in my mind and i find none of which i can say that it pertains to me  it would be tedious to stop to enumerate them  let us pass to the attributes of soul and see if there is any one which is in me what of nutrition or walking the first mentioned  but if it is so that i have no body it is also true that i can neither walk nor take nourishment  another attribute is sensation but one cannot feel without body and besides i have thought i perceived many things during sleep that i recognised in my waking moments as not having been experienced at all  what of thinking  i find here that thought is an attribute that belongs to me it alone cannot be separated from me  i am i exist that is certain  but how often  just when i think for it might possibly be the case if i ceased entirely to think that i should likewise cease altogether to exist  i do not now admit anything which is not necessarily true  to speak accurately i am not more than a thing which thinks that is to say a mind or a soul or an understanding or a reason which are terms whose significance was formerly unknown to me i am however a real thing and really exist but what thing i have answered  a thing which thinks       and what more  i shall exercise my imagination in order to see if i am not something more  i am not a collection of members which we call the human body  i am not a subtle air distributed through these members i am not a wind a fire a vapour a breath nor anything at all which i can imagine or conceive because i have assumed that all these were nothing without changing that supposition i find that i only leave myself certain of the fact that i am somewhat  but perhaps it is true that these same things which i supposed were non existent because they are unknown to me are really not different from the self which i know  i am not sure about this i shall not dispute about it now i can only give judgment on things that are known to me  i know that i exist and i inquire what i am i whom i know to exist  but it is very certain that the knowledge of my existence taken in its precise significance does not depend on things whose existence is not yet known to me consequently it does not depend on those which i can feign in imagination  and indeed the very term feign in imagination10 proves to me my error for i really do this if i image myself a something since to imagine is nothing else than to contemplate the figure or image of a corporeal thing  but i already know for certain that i am and that it may be that all these images and speaking generally all things that relate to the nature of body are nothing but dreams and chimeras  for this reason i see clearly that i have as little reason to say i shall stimulate my imagination in order to know more distinctly what i am than if i were to say i am now awake and i perceive somewhat that is real and true  but because i do not yet perceive it distinctly enough i shall go to sleep of express purpose so that my dreams may represent the perception with greatest truth and evidence  and thus i know for certain that nothing of all that i can understand by means of my imagination belongs to this knowledge which i have of myself and that it is necessary to recall the mind from this mode of thought with the utmost diligence in order that it may be able to know its own nature with perfect distinctness       but what then am i  a thing which thinks  what is a thing which thinks  it is a thing which doubts understands conceives affirms denies wills refuses which also imagines and feels       certainly it is no small matter if all these things pertain to my nature  but why should they not so pertain  am i not that being who now doubts nearly everything who nevertheless understands certain things who affirms that one only is true who denies all the others who desires to know more is averse from being deceived who imagines many things sometimes indeed despite his will and who perceives many likewise as by the intervention of the bodily organs  is there nothing in all this which is as true as it is certain that i exist even though i should always sleep and though  he who has given me being employed all his ingenuity in deceiving me  is there likewise any one of these attributes which can be distinguished from my thought or which might be said to be separated from myself  for it is so evident of itself that it is i who doubts who understands and who desires that there is no reason here to add anything to explain it  and i have certainly the power of imagining likewise for although it may happen as i formerly supposed that none of the things which i imagine are true nevertheless this power of imagining does not cease to be really in use and it forms part of my thought  finally i am the same who feels that is to say who perceives certain things as by the organs of sense since it truth i see light i hear noise i feel heat  but it will be said that these phenomena are false and that i am dreaming let it be so still it is at least quite certain that it seems to me that i see light that i hear noise and that i feel heat  that cannot be false properly speaking it is what is in me called feeling11 and used in this precise sense that is no other thing than thinking       from this time i begin to know what i am with a little more clearness and distinction than before but nevertheless it still seems to me and i cannot prevent myself from thinking that corporeal things whose images are framed by thought which are tested by the senses are much more distinctly known than that obscure part of me which does not come under the imagination  although really it is very strange to say that i know and understand more distinctly these things whose existence seems to me dubious which are unknown to me and which do not belong to me than others of the truth of which i am convinced which are known to me and which pertain to my real nature in a word than myself  but i see clearly how the case stands  my mind loves to wander and cannot yet suffer itself to be retained within the just limits of truth  very good let us once more give it the freest rein so that when afterwards we seize the proper occasion for pulling up it may the more easily be regulated and controlled       let us begin by considering the commonest matters those which we believe to be the most distinctly comprehended to wit the bodies which we touch and see not indeed bodies in general for these general ideas are usually a little more confused but let us consider one body in particular  let us take for example this piece of wax  it has been taken quite freshly from the hive and it has not yet lost the sweetness of the honey which it contains it still retains somewhat of the odour of the flowers from which it has been culled its colour its figure its size are apparent it is hard cold easily handled and if you strike it with the finger it will emit a sound  finally all the things which are requisite to cause us distinctly to recognise a body are met with in it but notice that while i speak and approach the fire what remained of the taste is exhaled the smell evaporates the colour alters the figure is destroyed the size increases it becomes liquid it heats scarcely can one handle it and when one strikes it now sound is emitted  does the same wax remain after this change  we must confess that it remains none would judge otherwise  what then did i know so distinctly in this piece of wax  it could certainly be nothing of all that the senses brought to my notice since all these things which fall under taste smell sight touch and hearing are found to be changed and yet the same wax remains       perhaps it was what i now think viz that this wax was not that sweetness of honey nor that agreeable scent of flowers nor that particular whiteness nor that figure nor that sound but simply a body which a little while before appeared tome as perceptible under these forms and which is now perceptible under others  but what precisely is it that i imagine when i form such conceptions  let us attentively consider this and abstracting from all that does not belong to the wax let us see what remains  certainly nothing remains excepting a certain extended thing which is flexible and movable  but what is the meaning of flexible and movable is it not that i imagine that this piece of wax being round is capable of becoming square and of passing from a square to a triangular figure  no certainly it is not that since i imagine it admits of an infinitude of similar changes and i nevertheless do not know how to compass the infinitude by my imagination and consequently this conception which i have of the wax is not brought about by the faculty of imagination what now is this extension  is it not also unknown  for it becomes greater when the wax is melted greater when it is boiled and greater still when the heat increases and i should not conceive clearly according to truth what wax is if i did not think that even this piece that we are considering is capable of receiving more variations in extension than i have ever imagined  we must then grant that i could not even understand through the imagination what this piece of wax is and that it is my mind12 alone which perceives it  i say this piece of wax in particular for as to wax in general it is yet clearer  but what is this piece of wax which cannot be understood excepting by the understanding or mind  it is certainly the same that i see touch imagine and finally it is the same which i have always believed it to be from the beginning  but what must particularly be observed is that its perception is neither an act of vision nor of touch nor of imagination and has never been such although it may have appeared formerly to be so but only an intuition13 of the mind which may be imperfect and confused as it was formerly or clear and distinct as it is at present according as my attention is more or less directed to the elements which are found in it and of which it is composed       yet in the meantime i am greatly astonished when i consider the great feebleness of mind and its proneness to fall insensibly into error for although without giving expression to my thought i consider all this in my own mind words often impede me and i am almost deceived by the terms of ordinary language  for we say that we see the same wax if it is present and not that we simply judge that it is the same from its having the same colour and figure  from this i should conclude that i knew the wax by means of vision and not simply by the intuition of the mind unless by chance i remember that when looking from a window and saying i see men who pass in the street i really do not see them but infer that what i see is men just as i say that i see wax  and yet what do i see from the window but hats and coats which may cover automatic machines  yet i judge these to be men  and similarly solely by the faculty of judgment which rests in my mind i comprehend that which i believed i saw with my eyes       a man who makes it his aim to raise his knowledge above the common should be ashamed to derive the occasion for doubting from the forms of speech invented by the vulgar i prefer to pass on and consider whether i had a more evident and perfect conception of what the wax was when i first perceived it and when i believed i knew it by means of the external senses or at least by the common sense14 as it is called that is to say by the imaginative faculty or whether my present conception is clearer now that i have most carefully examined what it is and in what way it can be known  it would certainly be absurd to doubt as to this  for what was there in this first perception which was distinct what was there which might not as well have been perceived by any of the animals  but when i distinguish the wax from its external forms and when just as if i had taken from it its vestments i consider it quite naked it is certain that although some error may still be found in my judgment i can nevertheless not perceive it thus without a human mind       but finally what shall i say of this mind that is of myself for up to this point i do not admit in myself anything but mind  what then i who seem to perceive this piece of wax so distinctly do i not know myself not only with much more truth and certainty but also with much more distinctness and clearness  for if i judge that the wax is or exists from the fact that i see it it certainly follows much more clearly that i am or that i exist myself from the fact that i see it for it may be that what i see is not really wax it may also be that i do not possess eyes with which to see anything but it cannot be that when i see or for i no longer take account of the distinction when i think i see that i myself who think am nought  so if i judge that the wax exists from the fact that i touch it the same thing will follow to wit that i am and if i judge that my imagination or some other cause whatever it is persuades me that the wax exists i shall still conclude the same  and what i have here remarked of wax may be applied to all other things which are external to me and which are met with outside of me  and further if the notion or perception of wax has seemed to me clearer and more distinct not only after the sight or the touch but also after many other causes have rendered it quite manifest to me with how much more evidence and distinctness must it be said that i now know myself since all the reasons which contribute to the knowledge of wax or any other body whatever are yet better proofs of the nature of my mind  and there are so many other things in the mind itself which may contribute to the elucidation of its nature that those which depend on body such as these just mentioned hardly merit being taken into account       but finally here i am having insensibly reverted to the point i desired for since it is now manifest to me that even bodies are not properly speaking known by the senses or by the faculty of imagination but by the understanding only and since they are not known from the fact that they are seen or touched but only because they are understood i see clearly that there is nothing which is easier for me to know than my mind  but because it is difficult to rid oneself so promptly of an opinion to which one was accustomed for so long it will be well that i should halt a little at this point so that by the length of my meditation i may more deeply imprint on my memory this new knowledge                                meditation iii                                                        of god  that he exists              i shall now close my eyes i shall stop my ears i shall call away all my senses i shall efface even from my thoughts all the images of corporeal things or at least for that is hardly possible i shall esteem them as vain and false and thus holding converse only with myself and considering my own nature i shall try little by little to reach a better knowledge of and a more familiar acquaintanceship with myself i am a thing that thinks that is to say that doubts affirms denies that knows a few things that is ignorant of many that loves that hates that wills that desires that also imagines and perceives for as i remarked before although the things which i perceive and imagine are perhaps nothing at all apart from me and in themselves i am nevertheless assured that these modes of thought that i call perceptions and imaginations inasmuch only as they are modes of thought certainly reside and are met with in me       and in the little that i have just said i think i have summed up all that i really know or at least all that hitherto i was aware that i knew  in order to try to extend my knowledge further i shall now look around more carefully and see whether i cannot still discover in myself some other things which i have not hitherto perceived  i am certain that i am a thing which thinks but do i not then likewise know what is requisite to render me certain of a truth  certainly in this first knowledge there is nothing that assures me of its truth excepting the clear and distinct perception of that which i state which would not indeed suffice to assure me that what i say is true if it could ever happen that a thing which i conceived so clearly and distinctly could be false and accordingly it seems to me that already i can establish as a general rule that all things which i perceive15 very clearly and very distinctly are true       at the same time i have before received and admitted many things to be very certain and manifest which yet i afterwards recognised as being dubious  what then were these things they were the earth sky stars and all other objects which i apprehended by means of the senses  but what did i clearly and distinctly perceive in them  nothing more than that the ideas or thoughts of these things were presented to my mind and not even now do i deny that these ideas are met with in me  but there was yet another thing which i affirmed and which owing to the habit which i had formed of believing it i thought i perceived very clearly although in truth i did not perceive it at all to wit that there were objects outside of me from which these ideas proceeded and to which they were entirely similar  and it was in this that i erred or if perchance my judgment was correct this was not due to any knowledge arising from my perception       but when i took anything very simple and easy in the sphere of arithmetic or geometry into consideration eg that two and three together made five and other things of the sort were not these present to my mind so clearly as to enable me to affirm that they were true  certainly if i judged that since such matters could be doubted this would not have been so for any other reason than that it came into my mind that perhaps a god might have endowed me with such a nature that i may have been deceived even concerning things which seemed to me most manifest  but every time that this preconceived opinion of the sovereign power of a god presents itself to my thought i am constrained to confess that it is easy to him if he wishes it to cause me to err even in matters in which i believe myself to have the best evidence and on the other hand always when i direct my attention to things which i believe myself to perceive very clearly i am so persuaded of their truth that i let myself break out into words such as these  let who will deceive me he can never cause me to be nothing while i think that i am or some day cause it to be true to say that i have never been it being true now to say that i am or that two and three make more or less than five or any such thing in which i see a manifest contradiction  and certainly since i have no reason to believe that there is a god who is a deceiver and as i have not yet satisfied myself that there is a god at all the reason for doubt which depends on this opinion alone is very slight and so to speak metaphysical  but in order to be able altogether to remove it i must inquire whether there is a god as soon as the occasion presents itself and if i find that there is a god i must also inquire whether he may be a deceiver for without a knowledge of these two truths i do not see that i can ever be certain of anything       and in order that i may have an opportunity of inquiring into this in an orderly way without interrupting the order of meditation which i have proposed to myself and which is little by little to pass from the notions which i find first of all in my mind to those which i shall later on discover in it it is requisite that i should here divide my thoughts into certain kinds and that i should consider in which of these kinds there is properly speaking truth or error to be found of my thoughts some are so to speak images of the things and to these alone is the title idea properly applied examples are my thought of a man or of a chimera of heaven of an angel or even of god  but other thoughts possess other forms as well  for example in willing fearing approving denying though i always perceive something as the subject of the action of my mind16 yet by this action i always add something else to the idea17 which i have of that thing and of the thoughts of this kind some are called volitions or affections and others judgments       now as to what concerns ideas if we consider them only in themselves and do not relate them to anything else beyond themselves they cannot properly speaking be false for whether i imagine a goat or a chimera it is not less true that i imagine the one that the other  we must not fear likewise that falsity can enter into will and into affections for although i may desire evil things or even things that never existed it is not the less true that i desire them thus there remains no more than the judgments which we make in which i must take the greatest care not o deceive myself but the principal error and the commonest which we may meet with in them consists in my judging that the ideas which are in me are similar or conformable to the things which are outside me for without doubt if i considered the ideas only as certain modes of my thoughts without trying to relate them to anything beyond they could scarcely give me material for error       but among these ideas some appear to me to be innate some adventitious and others to be formed or invented by myself for as i have the power of understanding what is called a thing or a truth or a thought it appears to me that i hold this power from no other source than my own nature  but if i now hear some sound if i see the sun or feel heat i have hitherto judged that these sensations proceeded from certain things that exist outside of me and finally it appears to me that sirens hippogryphs and the like are formed out of my own mind  but again i may possibly persuade myself that all these ideas are of the nature of those which i term adventitious or else that they are all innate or all fictitious  for i have not yet clearly discovered their true origin       and my principal task in this place is to consider in respect to those ideas which appear to me to proceed from certain objects that are outside me what are the reasons which cause me to think them similar to these objects  it seems indeed in the first place that i am taught this lesson by nature and secondly i experience in myself that these ideas do not depend on my will nor therefore on myself for they often present themselves to my mind in spite of my will just now for instance whether i will or whether i do not will i feel heat and thus i persuade myself that this feeling or at least this idea of heat is produced in me by something which is different from me ie by the heat of the fire near which i sit  and nothing seems to me more obvious than to judge that this object imprints its likeness rather than anything else upon me       now i must discover whether these proofs are sufficiently strong and convincing  when i say that i am so instructed by nature i merely mean a certain spontaneous inclination which impels me to believe in this connection and not a natural light which makes me recognise that it is true  but these two things are very different for i cannot doubt that which the natural light causes me to believe to be true as for example it has shown me that i am from the fact that i doubt or other facts of the same kind  and i possess no other faculty whereby to distinguish truth from falsehood which can teach me that what this light shows me to be true is not really true and no other faculty that is equally trustworthy but as far as apparently natural impulses are concerned i have frequently remarked when i had to make active choice between virtue and vice that they often enough led me to the part that was worse and this is why i do not see any reason for following them in what regards truth and error       and as to the other reason which is that these ideas must proceed from objects outside me since they do not depend on my will i do not find it any the more convincing  for just as these impulses of which i have spoken are found in me notwithstanding that they do not always concur with my will so perhaps there is in me some faculty fitted to produce these ideas without the assistance of any external things even though it is not yet known by me just as apparently they have hitherto always been found in me during sleep without the aid of any external objects       and finally though they did proceed from objects different from myself it is not a necessary consequence that they should resemble these  on the contrary i have noticed that in many cases there was a great difference between the object and its idea  i find for example two completely diverse ideas of the sun in my mind the one derives its origin from the senses and should be placed in the category of adventitious ideas according to this idea the sun seems to be extremely small but the other is derived from astronomical reasonings ie is elicited from certain notions that are innate in me or else it is formed by me in some other manner in accordance with it the sun appears to be several times greater than the earth  these two ideas cannot indeed both resemble the same sun and reason makes me believe that the one which seems to have originated directly from the sun itself is the one which is most dissimilar to it       all this causes me to believe that until the present time it has not been by a judgment that was certain or premeditated but only by a sort of blind impulse that i believed that things existed outside of and different from me which by the organs of my senses or by some other method whatever it might be conveyed these ideas or images to me and imprinted on me their similitudes       but there is yet another method of inquiring whether any of the objects of which i have ideas within me exist outside of me  if ideas are only taken as certain modes of thought i recognise amongst them no difference or inequality and all appear to proceed from me in the same manner but when we consider them as images one representing one thing and the other another it is clear that they are very different one from the other  there is no doubt that those which represent to me substances are something more and contain so to speak more objective reality within them that is to say by representation participate in a higher degree of being or perfection than those that simply represent modes or accidents and that idea again by which i understand a supreme god eternal infinite immutable omniscient omnipotent and creator of all things which are outside of himself has certainly more objective reality in itself than those ideas by which finite substances are represented       now it is manifest by the natural light that there must at least be as much reality in the efficient and total cause as in its effect  for pray whence can the effect derive its reality if not from its cause  and in what way can this cause communicate this reality to it unless it possessed it in itself  and from this it follows not only that something cannot proceed from nothing but likewise that what is more perfect that is to say which has more reality within itself cannot proceed from the less perfect  and this is not only evidently true of those effects which possess actual or formal reality but also of the ideas in which we consider merely what is termed objective reality  to take an example the stone which has not yet existed not only cannot now commence to be unless it has been produced by something which possesses within itself either formally or eminently all that enters into the composition of the stone ie it must possess the same things or other more excellent things than those which exist in the stone and heat can only be produced in a subject in which it did not previously exist by a cause that is of an order degree or kind at least as perfect as heat and so in all other cases  but further the idea of heat or of a stone cannot exist in me unless it has been placed within me by some cause which possesses within it at least as much reality as that which i conceive to exist in the heat or the stone  for although this cause does not transmit anything of its actual or formal reality to my idea we must not for that reason imagine that it is necessarily a less real cause we must remember that since every idea is a work of the mind its nature is such that it demands of itself no other formal reality than that which it borrows from my thought of which it is only a mode ie a manner or way of thinking  but in order that an idea should contain some one certain objective reality rather than another it must without doubt derive it from some cause in which there is at least as much formal reality as this idea contains of objective reality  for if we imagine that something is found in an idea which is not found in the cause it must then have been derived from nought but however imperfect may be this mode of being by which a thing is objectively or by representation in the understanding by its idea we cannot certainly say that this mode of being is nothing nor consequently that the idea derives its origin from nothing       nor must i imagine that since the reality that i consider in these ideas is only objective it is not essential that this reality should be formally in the causes of my ideas but that it is sufficient that it should be found objectively  for just as this mode of objective existence pertains to ideas by their proper nature so does the mode of formal existence pertain tot he causes of those ideas this is at least true of the first and principal by the nature peculiar to them  and although it may be the case that one idea gives birth to another idea that cannot continue to be so indefinitely for in the end we must reach an idea whose cause shall be so to speak an archetype in which the whole reality or perfection which is so to speak objectively or by representation in these ideas is contained formally and really  thus the light of nature causes me to know clearly that the ideas in me are like pictures or images which can in truth easily fall short of the perfection of the objects from which they have been derived but which can never contain anything greater or more perfect       and the longer and the more carefully that i investigate these matters the more clearly and distinctly do i recognise their truth  but what am i to conclude from it all in the end  it is this that if the objective reality of any one of my ideas is of such a nature as clearly to make me recognise that it is not in me either formally or eminently and that consequently i cannot myself be the cause of it it follows of necessity that i am not alone in the world but that there is another being which exists or which is the cause of this idea  on the other hand had no such an idea existed in me i should have had no sufficient argument to convince me of the existence of any being beyond myself for i have made very careful investigation everywhere and up to the present time have been able to find no other ground       but of my ideas beyond that which represents me to myself as to which there can here be no difficulty there is another which represents a god and there are others representing corporeal and inanimate things others angels others animals and others again which represent to me men similar to myself       as regards the ideas which represent to me other men or animals or angels i can however easily conceive that they might be formed by an admixture of the other ideas which i have of myself of corporeal things and of god even although there were apart from me neither men nor animals nor angels in all the world       and in regard to the ideas of corporeal objects i do not recognise in them anything so great or so excellent that they might not have possibly proceeded from myself for if i consider them more closely and examine them individually as i yesterday examined the idea of wax i find that there is very little in them which i perceive clearly and distinctly magnitude or extension in length breadth or depth i do so perceive also figure which results from a termination of this extension the situation which bodies of different figure preserve in relation to one another and movement or change of situation to which we may also add substance duration and number  as to other things such as light colours sounds scents tastes heat cold and the other tactile qualities they are thought by me with so much obscurity and confusion that i do not even know if they are true or false ie whether the ideas which i form of these qualities are actually the ideas of real objects or not or whether they only represent chimeras which cannot exist in fact  for although i have before remarked that it is only in judgments that falsity properly speaking or formal falsity can be met with a certain material falsity may nevertheless be found in ideas ie when these ideas represent what is nothing as though it were something  for example the ideas which i have of cold and heat are so far from clear and distinct that by their means i cannot tell whether cold is merely a privation of heat or heat a privation of cold or whether both are real qualities or are not such  and inasmuch as since ideas resemble images there cannot be any ideas which do not appear to represent some things if it is correct to say that cold is merely a privation of heat the idea which represents it to me as something real and positive will not be improperly termed false and the same holds good of other similar ideas       to these it is certainly not necessary that i should attribute any author other than myself  for if they are false ie if they represent things which do not exist the light of nature shows me that they issue from nought that is to say that they are only in me so far as something is lacking to the perfection of my nature  but if they are true nevertheless because they exhibit so little reality to me that i cannot even clearly distinguish the thing represented from nonbeing i do not see any reason why they should not be produced by myself       as to the clear and distinct idea which i have of corporeal things some of them seem as though i might have derived them from the idea which i possess of myself as those which i have of substance duration number and such like for even when i think that a stone is a substance or at least a thing capable of existing of itself and that i am a substance also although i conceive that i am a thing that thinks and not one that is extended and that the stone on the other hand is an extended thing which does not think and that thus there is a notable difference between the two conceptions they seem nevertheless to agree in this that both represent substances  in the same way when i perceive that i now exist and further recollect that i have in former times existed and when i remember that i have various thoughts of which i can recognise the number i acquire ideas of duration and number which i can afterwards transfer to any object that i please  but as to all the other qualities of which the ideas of corporeal things are composed to wit extension figure situation and motion it is true that they are not formally in me since i am only a thing that thinks but because they are merely certain modes of substance and so to speak the vestments under which corporeal substance appears to us and because i myself am also a substance it would seem that they might be contained in me eminently       hence there remains only the idea of god concerning which we must consider whether it is something which cannot have proceeded from me myself  by the name god i understand a substance that is infinite eternal immutable independent allknowing allpowerful and by which i myself and everything else if anything else does exist have been created  now all these characteristics are such that the more diligently i attend to them the less do they appear capable of proceeding from me alone hence from what has been already said we must conclude that god necessarily exists       for although the idea of substance is within me owing to the fact that i am substance nevertheless i should not have the idea of an infinite substance since i am finite if it had not proceeded from some substance which was veritably infinite       nor should i imagine that i do not perceive the infinite by a true idea but only by the negation of the finite just as i perceive repose and darkness by the negation of movement and of light for on the contrary i see that there is manifestly more reality in infinite substance than in finite and therefore that in some way i have in me the notion of the infinite earlier then the finite to wit the notion of god before that of myself  for how would it be possible that i should know that i doubt and desire that is to say that something is lacking to me and that i am not quite perfect unless i had within me some idea of a being more perfect than myself in comparison with which i should recognise the deficiencies of my nature       and we cannot say that this idea of god is perhaps materially false and that consequently i can derive it from nought ie that possibly it exists in me because i am imperfect as i have just said is the case with ideas of heat cold and other such things for on the contrary as this idea is very clear and distinct and contains within it more objective reality than any other there can be none which is of itself more true nor any in which there can be less suspicion of falsehood  the idea i say of this being who is absolutely perfect and infinite is entirely true for although perhaps we can imagine that such a being does not exist we cannot nevertheless imagine that his idea represents nothing real to me as i have said of the idea of cold  this idea is also very clear and distinct since all that i conceive clearly and distinctly of the real and the true and of what conveys some perfection is in its entirety contained in this idea  and this does not cease to be true although i do not comprehend the infinite or though in god there is an infinitude of things which i cannot comprehend nor possibly even reach in any way by thought for it is of the nature of the infinite that my nature which is finite and limited should not comprehend it and it is sufficient that i should understand this and that i should judge that all things which i clearly perceive and in which i know that there is some perfection and possibly likewise an infinitude of properties of which i am ignorant are in god formally or eminently so that the idea which i have of him may become the most true most clear and most distinct of all the ideas that are in my mind       but possibly i am something more than i suppose myself to be and perhaps all those perfections which i attribute to god are in some way potentially in me although they do not yet disclose themselves or issue in action  as a matter of fact i am already sensible that my knowledge increases and perfects itself little by little and i see nothing which can prevent it from increasing more and more into infinitude nor do i see after it has thus been increased or perfected anything to prevent my being able to acquire by its means all the other perfections of the divine nature nor finally why the power i have of acquiring these perfections if it really exists in me shall not suffice to produce the ideas of them       at the same time i recognise that this cannot be  for in the first place although it were true that every day my knowledge acquired new degrees of perfection and that there were in my nature many things potentially which are not yet there actually nevertheless these excellences do not pertain to or make the smallest approach to the idea which i have of god in whom there is nothing merely potential but in whom all is present really and actually for it is an infallible token of imperfection in my knowledge that it increases little by little  and further although my knowledge grows more and more nevertheless i do not for that reason believe that it can ever be actually infinite since it can never reach a point so high that it will be unable to attain to any greater increase  but i understand god to be actually infinite so that he can add nothing to his supreme perfection  and finally i perceive that the objective being of an idea cannot be produced by a being that exists potentially only which properly speaking is nothing but only by a being which is formal or actual       to speak the truth i see nothing in all that i have just said which by the light of nature is not manifest to anyone who desires to think attentively on the subject but when i slightly relax my attention my mind finding its vision somewhat obscured and so to speak blinded by the images of sensible objects i do not easily recollect the reason why the idea that i possess of a being more perfect then i must necessarily have been placed in me by a being which is really more perfect and this is why i wish here to go on to inquire whether i who have this idea can exist if no such being exists       and i ask from whom do i then derive my existence perhaps from myself or from my parents or from some other source less perfect than god for we can imagine nothing more perfect than god or even as perfect as he is       but were i independent of every other and were i myself the author of my being i should doubt nothing and i should desire nothing and finally no perfection would be lacking to me for i should have bestowed on myself every perfection of which i possessed any idea and should thus be god  and it must not be imagined that those things that are lacking to me are perhaps more difficult of attainment than those which i already possess for on the contrary it is quite evident that it was a matter of much greater difficulty to bring to pass that i that is to say a thing or a substance that thinks should emerge out of nothing than it would be to attain to the knowledge of many things of which i am ignorant and which are only the accidents of this thinking substance but it is clear that if i had of myself possessed this greater perfection of which i have just spoken that is to say if i had been the author of my own existence i should not at least have denied myself the things which are the more easy to acquire to wit many branches of knowledge of which my nature is destitute nor should i have deprived myself of any of the things contained in the idea which i form of god because there are none of them which seem to me specially difficult to acquire  and if there were any that were more difficult to acquire they would certainly appear to me to be such supposing i myself were the origin of the other things which i possess since i should discover in them that my powers were limited       but though i assume that perhaps i have always existed just as i am at present neither can i escape the force of this reasoning and imagine that the conclusion to be drawn from this is that i need not seek for any author of my existence  for all the course of my life may be divided into an infinite number of parts none of which is in any way dependent on the other and thus from the fact that i was in existence a short time ago it does not follow that i must be in existence now unless some cause at this instant so to speak produces me anew that is to say conserves me  it is as a matter of fact perfectly clear and evident to all those who consider with attention the nature of time that in order to be conserved in each moment in which it endures a substance has need of the same power and action as would be necessary to produce and create it anew supposing it did not yet exist so that the light of nature shows us clearly that the distinction between creation and conservation is solely a distinction of the reason       all that i thus require here is that i should interrogate myself if i wish to know whether i possess a power which is capable of bringing it to pass that i who now am shall still be in the future for since i am nothing but a thinking thing or at least since thus far it is only this portion of myself which is precisely in question at present if such a power did reside in me i should certainly be conscious of it  but i am conscious of nothing of the kind and by this i know clearly that i depend on some being different from myself       possibly however this being on which i depend is not that which i call god and i am created either by my parents or by some other cause less perfect than god  this cannot be because as i have just said it is perfectly evident that there must be at least as much reality in the cause as in the effect and thus since i am a thinking thing and possess an idea of god within me whatever in the end be the cause assigned to my existence it must be allowed that it is likewise a thinking thing and that it possesses in itself the idea of all the perfections which i attribute to god  we may again inquire whether this cause derives its origin from itself or from some other thing  for if from itself it follows by the reasons before brought forward that this cause must itself be god for since it possesses the virtue of self existence it must also without doubt have the power of actually possessing all the perfections of which it has the idea that is all those which i conceive as existing in god but if it derives its existence from some other cause than itself we shall again ask for the same reason whether this second cause exists by itself or through another until from one step to another we finally arrive at an ultimate cause which will be god       and it is perfectly manifest that in this there can be no regression into infinity since what is in question is not so much the cause which formerly created me as that which conserves me at the present time       nor can we suppose that several causes may have concurred in my production and that from one i have received the idea of one of the perfections which i attribute to god and from another the idea of some other so that all these perfections indeed exist somewhere in the universe but not as complete in one unity which is god  on the contrary the unity the simplicity or the inseparability of all things which are in god is one of the principal perfections which i conceive to be in him  and certainly the idea of this unity of all divine perfections cannot have been placed in me by any cause from which i have not likewise received the ideas of all the other perfections for this cause could not make me able to comprehend them as joined together in an inseparable unity without having at the same time caused me in some measure to know what they are and in some way to recognise each one of them       finally so far as my parents from whom it appears i have sprung are concerned although all that i have ever been able to believe of them were true that does not make it follow that it is they who conserve me nor are they even the authors of my being in any sense in so far as i am a thinking being since what they did was merely to implant certain dispositions in that matter in which the self ie the mind which alone i at present identify with myself is by me deemed to exist  and thus there can be no difficulty in their regard but we must of necessity conclude from the fact alone that i exist or that the idea of a being supremely perfect that is of god is in me that the proof of gods existence is grounded on the highest evidence       it only remains to me to examine into the manner in which i have acquired this idea from god for i have not received it through the senses and it is never presented to me unexpectedly as is usual with the ideas of sensible things when these things present themselves or seem to present themselves to the external organs of my senses nor is it likewise a fiction of my mind for it is not in my power to take from or to add anything to it and consequently the only alternative is that it is innate in me just as the idea of myself is innate in me       and one certainly ought not to find it strange that god in creating me placed this idea within me to be like the mark of the workman imprinted on his work and it is likewise not essential that the mark shall be something different from the work itself  for from the sole fact that god created me it is most probable that in some way he has placed his image and similitude upon me and that i perceive this similitude in which the idea of god is contained by means of the same faculty by which i perceive myself that is to say when i reflect on myself i not only know that i am something imperfect incomplete and dependent on another which incessantly aspires after something which is better and greater than myself but i also know that he on whom i depend possesses in himself all the great things towards which i aspire and the ideas of which i find within myself and that not indefinitely or potentially alone but really actually and infinitely and that thus he is god  and the whole strength of the argument which i have here made use of to prove the existence of god consists in this that i recognise that it is not possible that my nature should be what it is and indeed that i should have in myself the idea of a god if god did not veritably exist a god i say whose idea is in me ie who possesses all those supreme perfections of which our mind may indeed have some idea but without understanding them all who is liable to no errors or defect and who has none of all those marks which denote imperfection  from this it is manifest that he cannot be a deceiver since the light of nature teaches us that fraud and deception necessarily proceed from some defect       but before i examine this matter with more care and pass on to the consideration of other truths which may be derived from it it seems to me right to pause for a while in order to contemplate god himself to ponder at leisure his marvellous attributes to consider and admire and adore the beauty of this light so resplendent at least as far as the strength of my mind which is in some measure dazzled by the sight will allow me to do so  for just as faith teaches us that the supreme felicity of the other life consists only in this contemplation of the divine majesty so we continue to learn by experience that a similar meditation though incomparably less perfect causes us to enjoy the greatest satisfaction of which we are capable in this life                                 meditation iv                                                       of the true and the false              i have been well accustomed these past days to detach my mind from my senses and i have accurately observed that there are very few things that one knows with certainty respecting corporeal objects that there are many more which are known to us respecting the human mind and yet more still regarding god himself so that i shall now without any difficulty abstract my thoughts from the consideration of sensible or imaginable objects and carry them to those which being withdrawn from all contact with matter are purely intelligible  and certainly the idea which i possess of the human mind inasmuch as it is a thinking thing and not extended in length width and depth nor participating in anything pertaining to body is incomparably more distinct than is the idea of any corporeal thing  and when i consider that i doubt that is to say that i am an incomplete and dependent being the idea of a being that is complete and independent that is of god presents itself to my mind with so much distinctness and clearness and from the fact alone that this idea is found in me or that i who possess this idea exist i conclude so certainly that god exists and that my existence depends entirely on him in every moment of my life that i do not think that the human mind is capable of knowing anything with more evidence and certitude  and it seems to me that i now have before me a road which will lead us from the contemplation of the true god in whom all the treasures of science and wisdom are contained to the knowledge of the other objects of the universe       for first of all i recognise it to be impossible that he should ever deceive me for in all fraud and deception some imperfection is to be found and although it may appear that the power of deception is a mark of subtilty or power yet the desire to deceive without doubt testifies to malice or feebleness and accordingly cannot be found in god       in the next place i experienced in myself a certain capacity for judging which i have doubtless received from god like all the other things that i possess and as he could not desire to deceive me it is clear that he has not given me a faculty that will lead me to err if i use it aright       and no doubt respecting this matter could remain if it were not that the consequence would seem to follow that i can thus never be deceived for if i hold all that i possess from god and if he has not placed in me the capacity for error it seems as though i could never fall into error  and it is true that when i think only of god and direct my mind wholly to him18 i discover in myself no cause of error or falsity yet directly afterwards when recurring to myself experience shows me that i am nevertheless subject to an infinitude of errors as to which when we come to investigate them more closely i notice that not only is there a real and positive idea of god or of a being of supreme perfection present to my mind but also so to speak a certain negative idea of nothing that is of that which is infinitely removed from any kind of perfection and that i am in a sense something intermediate between god and nought ie placed in such a manner between the supreme being and nonbeing that there is in truth nothing in me that can lead to error in so far as a sovereign being has formed me but that as i in some degree participate likewise in nought or in nonbeing ie in so far as i am not myself the supreme being and as i find myself subject to an infinitude of imperfections i ought not to be astonished if i should fall into error  thus do i recognise that error in so far as it is such is not a real thing depending on god but simply a defect and therefore in order to fall into it that i have no need to possess a special faculty given me by god for this very purpose but that i fall into error from the fact that the power given me by god for the purpose of distinguishing truth from error is not infinite       nevertheless this does not quite satisfy me for error is not a pure negation ie is not the dimple defect or want of some perfection which ought not to be mine but it is a lack of some knowledge which it seems that i ought to possess  and on considering the nature of god it does not appear to me possible that he should have given me a faculty which is not perfect of its kind that is which is wanting in some perfection due to it  for if it is true that the more skilful the artizan the more perfect is the work of his hands what can have been produced by this supreme creator of all things that is not in all its parts perfect  and certainly there is no doubt that god could have created me so that i could never have been subject to error it is also certain that he ever wills what is best is it then better that i should be subject to err than that i should not       in considering this more attentively it occurs to me in the first place that i should not be astonished if my intelligence is not capable of comprehending why god acts as he does and that there is thus no reason to doubt of his existence from the fact that i may perhaps find many other things besides this as to which i am able to understand neither for what reason nor how god has produced them  for in the first place knowing that my nature is extremely feeble and limited and that the nature of god is on the contrary immense incomprehensible and infinite i have no further difficulty in recognising that there is an infinitude of matter in his power the causes of which transcend my knowledge and this reason suffices to convince me that the species of cause termed final finds no useful employment in physical or natural things for it does not appear to me that i can without temerity seek to investigate the inscrutable ends of god       it further occurs to me that we should not consider one single creature separately when we inquire as to whether the works of god are perfect but should regard all his creations together  for the same thing which might possibly seem very imperfect with some semblance of reason if regarded by itself is found to be very perfect if regarded as part of the whole universe and although since i resolved to doubt all things i as yet have only known certainly my own existence and that of god nevertheless since i have recognised the infinite power of god i cannot deny that he may have produced many other things or at least that he has the power of producing them so that i may obtain a place as a part of a great universe       whereupon regarding myself more closely and considering what are my errors for they alone testify to there being any imperfection in me i answer that they depend on a combination of two causes to wit on the faculty of knowledge that rests in me and on the power of choice or of free will that is to say of the understanding and at the same time of the will  for by the understanding alone i neither assert nor deny anything but apprehend19 the ideas of things as to which i can form a judgment  but no error is properly speaking found in it provided the word error is taken in its proper signification and though there is possibly an infinitude of things in the world of which i have no idea in my understanding we cannot for all that say that it is deprived of these ideas as we might say of something which is required by its nature but simply it does not possess these because in truth there is no reason to prove that god should have given me a greater faculty of knowledge than he has given me and however skillful a workman i represent him to be i should not for all that consider that he was bound to have placed in each of his works all the perfections which he may have been able to place in some  i likewise cannot complain that god has not given me a free choice or a will which is sufficient ample and perfect since as a matter of fact i am conscious of a will so extended as to be subject to no limits and what seems to me very remarkable in this regard is that of all the qualities which i possess there is no one so perfect and so comprehensive that i do not very clearly recognise that it might be yet greater and more perfect  for to take an example if i consider the faculty of comprehension which i possess i find that it is of very small extent and extremely limited and at the same time i find the idea of another faculty much more ample and even infinite and seeing that i can form the idea of it i recognise from this very fact that it pertains to the nature of god  if in the same way i examine the memory the imagination or some other faculty i do not find any which is not small and circumscribed while in god it is immense or infinite  it is freewill alone or liberty of choice which i find to be so great in me that i can conceive no other idea to be more great it is indeed the case that it is for the most part this will that causes me to know that in some manner i bear the image and similitude of god for although the power of will is incomparably greater in god than in me both by reason of the knowledge and the power which conjoined with it render it stronger and more efficacious and by reason of its object inasmuch as in god it extends to a great many things it nevertheless does not seem to me greater if i consider it formally and precisely in itself  for the faculty of will consists alone in our having the power of choosing to do a thing or choosing not to do it that is to affirm or deny to pursue or to shun it or rather it consists alone in the fact that in order to affirm or deny pursue or shun those things placed before us by the understanding we act so that we are unconscious that any outside force constrains us in doing so  for in order that i should be free it is not necessary that i should be indifferent as to the choice of one or the other of two contraries but contrariwise the more i lean to the one whether i recognise clearly that the reasons of the good and true are to be found in it or whether god so disposes my inward thought the more freely do i choose and embrace it and undoubtedly both divine grace and natural knowledge far from diminishing my liberty rather increase it and strengthen it  hence this indifference which i feel when i am not swayed to one side rather than to the other by lack of reason is the lowest grade of liberty and rather evinces a lack or negation in knowledge than a perfection of will  for if i always recognised clearly what was true and good i should never have trouble in deliberating as to what judgment or choice i should make and then i should be entirely free without ever being indifferent       from all this i recognise that the power of will which i have received from god is not of itself the source of my errors for it is very ample and very perfect of its kind any more than is the power of understanding for since i understand nothing but by the power which god has given me for understanding there is no doubt that all that i understand i understand as i ought and it is not possible that i err in this  whence then come my errors  they come from the sole fact that since the will is much wider in its range and compass than the understanding i do not restrain it within the same bounds but extend it also to things which i do not understand  and as the will is of itself indifferent to these it easily falls into error and sin and chooses the evil for the good or the false for the true       for example when i lately examined whether anything existed in the world and found that from the very fact that i considered this question it followed very clearly that i myself existed i could not prevent myself from believing that a thing i so clearly conceived was true  not that i found myself compelled to do so by some external cause but simply because from great clearness in my mind there followed a great inclination of my will and i believed this with so much the greater freedom or spontaneity as i possessed the less indifference towards it  now on the contrary i not only know that i exist inasmuch as i am a thinking thing but a certain representation of corporeal nature is also presented to my mind and it comes to pass that i doubt whether this thinking nature which is in me or rather by which i am what i am differs from this corporeal nature or whether both are not simply the same thing and i here suppose that i do not yet know any reason to persuade me to adopt the one belief rather than the other  from this it follows that i am entirely indifferent as to which of the two i affirm or deny or even whether i abstain from forming any judgment in the matter       and this indifference does not only extend to matters as to which the understanding has no knowledge but also in general to all those which are not apprehended with perfect clearness at the moment when the will is deliberating upon them  for however probable are the conjectures which render me disposed to form a judgment respecting anything the simple knowledge that i have that those are conjectures alone and not certain and indubitable reasons suffices to occasion me to judge the contrary  of this i have had great experience of late when i set aside as false all that i had formerly held to be absolutely true for the sole reason that i remarked that it might in some measure be doubted       but if i abstain from giving my judgment on any thing when i do not perceive it with sufficient clearness and distinctness it is plain that i act rightly and am not deceived  but if i determine to deny or affirm i no longer make use as i should of my free will and if i affirm what is not true it is evident that i deceive myself even though i judge according to truth this comes about only by chance and i do not escape the blame of misusing my freedom for the light of nature teaches us that the knowledge of the understanding should always precede the determination of the will  and it is in the misuse of the free will that the privation which constitutes the characteristic nature of error is met with  privation i say is found in the act in so far as it proceeds from me but it is not found in the faculty which i have received from god nor even in the act in so far as it depends on him       for i have certainly no cause to complain that god has not given me an intelligence which is more powerful or a natural light which is stronger than that which i have received from him since it is proper to the finite understanding not to comprehend a multitude of things and it is proper to a created understanding to be finite on the contrary i have every reason to render thanks to god who owes me nothing and who has given me all the perfections i possess and i should be far from charging him with injustice and with having deprived me of or wrongfully withheld from me these perfections which he has not bestowed upon me       i have further no reason to complain that he has given me a will more ample than my understanding for since the will consists only of one single element and is so to speak indivisible it appears that its nature is such that nothing can be abstracted from it without destroying it and certainly the more comprehensive it is found to be the more reason i have to render gratitude to the giver       and finally i must also not complain that god concurs with me in forming the acts of the will that is the judgment in which i go astray because these acts are entirely true and good inasmuch as they depend on god and in a certain sense more perfection accrues to my nature from the fact that i can form them than if i could not do so  as to the privation in which alone the formal reason of error or sin consists it has no need of any concurrence from god since it is not a thing or an existence and since it is not related to god as to a cause but should be termed merely a negation according to the significance given to these words in the schools  for in fact it is not an imperfection in god that he has given me the liberty to give or withhold my assent from certain things as to which he has not placed a clear and distinct knowledge in my understanding but it is without doubt an imperfection in me not to make a good use of my freedom and to give my judgment readily on matters which i only understand obscurely i nevertheless perceive that god could easily have created me so that i never should err although i still remained free and endowed with a limited knowledge viz by giving to my understanding a clear and distinct intelligence of all things as to which i should ever have to deliberate or simply by his engraving deeply in my memory the resolution never to form a judgment on anything without having a clear and distinct understanding of it so that i could never forget it  and it is easy for me to understand that in so far as i consider myself alone and as if there were only myself in the world i should have been much more perfect than i am if god had created me so that i could never err  nevertheless i cannot deny that in some sense it is a greater perfection in the whole universe that certain parts should not be exempt from error as others are than that all parts should be exactly similar  and i have no right to complain if god having placed me in the world has not called upon me to play a part that excels all others in distinction and perfection       and further i have reason to be glad on the ground that if he has not given me the power of never going astray by the first means pointed out above which depends on a clear and evident knowledge of all the things regarding which i can deliberate he has at least left within my power the other means which is firmly to adhere to the resolution never to give judgment on matters whose truth is not clearly known to me for although i notice a certain weakness in my nature in that i cannot continually concentrate my mind on one single thought i can yet by attentive and frequently repeated meditation impress it so forcibly on my memory that i shall never fail to recollect it whenever i have need of it and thus acquire the habit of never going astray       and inasmuch as it is in this that the greatest and principal perfection of man consists it seems to me that i have not gained little by this days meditation since i have discovered the source of falsity and error  and certainly there can be no other source than that which i have explained for as often as i so restrain my will within the limits of my knowledge that it forms no judgment except on matters which are clearly and distinctly represented to it by the understanding i can never be deceived for every clear and distinct conception20 is without doubt something and hence cannot derive its origin from what is nought but must of necessity have god as its author god i say who being supremely perfect cannot be the cause of any error and consequently we must conclude that such a conception or such a judgment is true  nor have i only learned today what i should avoid in order that i may not err but also how i should act in order to arrive at a knowledge of the truth for without doubt i shall arrive at this end if i devote my attention sufficiently to those things which i perfectly understand and if i separate from these that which i only understand confusedly and with obscurity  to these i shall henceforth diligently give heed                                 meditation v                                    of the essence of material things and again of god that he                             exists       many other matters respecting the attributes of god and my own nature or mind remain for consideration but i shall possibly on another occasion resume the investigation of these  now after first noting what must be done or avoided in order to arrive at a knowledge of the truth my principal task is to endeavour to emerge from the state of doubt into which i have these last days fallen and to see whether nothing certain can be known regarding material things       but before examining whether any such objects as i conceive exist outside of me i must consider the ideas of them in so far as they are in my thought and see which of them are distinct and which confused       in the first place i am able distinctly to imagine that quantity which philosophers commonly call continuous or the extension in length breadth or depth that is in this quantity or rather in the object to which it is attributed further i can number in it many different parts and attribute to each of its parts many sorts of size figure situation and local movement and finally i can assign to each of these movements all degrees of duration       and not only do i know these things with distinctness when i consider them in general but likewise however little i apply my attention to the matter i discover an infinitude of particulars respecting numbers figures movements and other such things whose truth is so manifest and so well accords with my nature that when i begin to discover them it seems to me that i learn nothing new or recollect what i formerly knew that is to say that i for the first time perceive things which were already present to my mind although i had not as yet applied my mind to them       and what i here find to be most important is that i discover in myself an infinitude of ideas of certain things which cannot be esteemed as pure negations although they may possibly have no existence outside of my thought and which are not framed by me although it is within my power either to think or not to think them but which possess natures which are true and immutable  for example when i imagine a triangle although there may nowhere in the world be such a figure outside my thought or ever have been there is nevertheless in this figure a certain determinate nature form or essence which is immutable and eternal which i have not invented and which in no wise depends on my mind as appears from the fact that diverse properties of that triangle can be demonstrated viz that its three angles are equal to two right angles that the greatest side is subtended by the greatest angle and the like which now whether i wish it or do not wish it i recognise very clearly as pertaining to it although i never thought of the matter at all when i imagined a triangle for the first time and which therefore cannot be said to have been invented by me       nor does the objection hold good that possibly this idea of a triangle has reached my mind through the medium of my senses since i have sometimes seen bodies triangular in shape because i can form in my mind an infinitude of other figures regarding which we cannot have the least conception of their ever having been objects of sense and i can nevertheless demonstrate various properties pertaining to their nature as well as to that of the triangle and these must certainly all be true since i conceive them clearly hence they are something and not pure negation for it is perfectly clear that all that is true is something and i have already fully demonstrated that all that i know clearly is true  and even although i had not demonstrated this the nature of my mind is such that i could not prevent myself from holding them to be true so long as i conceive them clearly and i recollect that even when i was still strongly attached to the objects of sense i counted as the most certain those truths which i conceived clearly as regards figures numbers and the other matters which pertain to arithmetic and geometry and in general to pure and abstract mathematics       but now if just because i can draw the idea of something from my thought it follows that all which i know clearly and distinctly as pertaining to this object does really belong to it may i not derive from this an argument demonstrating the existence of god  it is certain that i no less find the idea of god that is to say the idea of a supremely perfect being in me than that of any figure or number whatever it is and i do not know any less clearly and distinctly that an actual and eternal existence pertains to this nature than i know that all that which i am able to demonstrate of some figure or number truly pertains to the nature of this figure or number and therefore although all that i concluded in the preceding meditations were found to be false the existence of god would pass with me as at least as certain as i have ever held the truths of mathematics which concern only numbers and figures to be       this indeed is not at first manifest since it would seem to present some appearance of being a sophism  for being accustomed in all other things to make a distinction between existence and essence i easily persuade myself that the existence can be separated from the essence of god and that we can thus conceive god as not actually existing  but nevertheless when i think of it with more attention i clearly see that existence can no more be separated from the essence of god than can its having its three angles equal to two right angles be separated from the essence of a rectilinear triangle or the idea of a mountain from the idea of a valley and so there is not any less repugnance to our conceiving a god that is a being supremely perfect to whom existence is lacking that is to say to whom a certain perfection is lacking than to conceive of a mountain which has no valley       but although i cannot really conceive of a god without existence any more than a mountain without a valley still from the fact that i conceive of a mountain with a valley it does not follow that there is such a mountain in the world similarly although i conceive of god as possessing existence it would seem that it does not follow that there is a god which exists for my thought does not impose any necessity upon things and just as i may imagine a winged horse although no horse with wings exists so i could perhaps attribute existence to god although no god existed       but a sophism is concealed in this objection for from the fact that i cannot conceive a mountain without a valley it does not follow that there is any mountain or any valley in existence but only that the mountain and the valley whether they exist or do not exist cannot in any way be separated one from the other  while from the fact that i cannot conceive god without existence it follows that existence is inseparable from him and hence that he really exists not that my thought can bring this to pass or impose any necessity on things but on the contrary because the necessity which lies in the thing itself ie the necessity of the existence of god determines me to think in this way for it is not within my power to think of god without existence that is of a supremely perfect being devoid of a supreme perfection though it is in my power to imagine a horse either with wings or without wings       and we must not here object that it is in truth necessary for me to assert that god exists after having presupposed that he possesses every sort of perfection since existence is one of these but that as a matter of fact my original supposition was not necessary just as it is not necessary to consider that all quadrilateral figures can be inscribed in the circle for supposing i thought this i should be constrained to admit that the rhombus might be inscribed in the circle since it is a quadrilateral figure which however is manifestly false we must not i say make any such allegations because although it is not necessary that i should at any time entertain the notion of god nevertheless whenever it happens that i think of a first and a sovereign being and so to speak derive the idea of him from the storehouse of my mind it is necessary that i should attribute to him every sort of perfection although i do not get so far as to enumerate them all or to apply my mind to each one in particular  and this necessity suffices to make me conclude after having recognised that existence is a perfection that this first and sovereign being really exists just as though it is not necessary for me ever to imagine any triangle yet whenever i wish to consider a rectilinear figure composed only of three angles it is absolutely essential that i should attribute to it all those properties which serve to bring about the conclusion that its three angles are not greater than two right angles even although i may not then be considering this point in particular  but when i consider which figures are capable of being inscribed in the circle it is in no wise necessary that i should think that all quadrilateral figures are of this number on the contrary i cannot even pretend that this is the case so long as i do not desire to accept anything which i cannot conceive clearly and distinctly  and in consequence there is a great difference between the false suppositions such as this and the true ideas born within me the first and principal of which is that of god  for really i discern in many ways that this idea is not something factitious and depending solely on my thought but that it is the image of a true and immutable nature first of all because i cannot conceive anything but god himself to whose essence existence necessarily pertains in the second place because it is not possible for me to conceive two or more gods in this same position and granted that there is one such god who now exists i see clearly that it is necessary that he should have existed from all eternity and that he must exist eternally and finally because i know an infinitude of other properties in god none of which i can either diminish or change       for the rest whatever proof or argument i avail myself of we must always return to the point that it is only those things which we conceive clearly and distinctly that have the power of persuading me entirely  and although amongst the matters which i conceive of in this way some indeed are manifestly obvious to all while others only manifest themselves to those who consider them closely and examine them attentively still after they have once been discovered the latter are not esteemed as any less certain than the former for example in the case of every rightangled triangle although it does not so manifestly appear that the square of the base is equal to the squares of the two other sides as that this base is opposite to the greatest angle still when this has once been apprehended we are just as certain of its truth as of the truth of the other  and as regards god if my mind were not preoccupied with prejudices and if my thought did not find itself on all hands diverted by the continual pressure of sensible things there would be nothing which i could know more immediately and more easily than him  for is there anything more manifest than that there is a god that is to say a supreme being to whose essence alone existence pertains21       and although for a firm grasp of this truth i have need of a strenuous application of mind at present i not only feel myself to be as assured of it as of all that i hold as most certain but i also remark that the certainty of all other things depends on it so absolutely that without this knowledge it is impossible ever to know anything perfectly       for although i am of such a nature that as long as22 i understand anything very clearly and distinctly i am naturally impelled to believe it to be true yet because i am also of such a nature that i cannot have my mind constantly fixed on the same object in order to perceive it clearly and as i often recollect having formed a past judgment without at the same time properly recollecting the reasons that led me to make it it may happen meanwhile that other reasons present themselves to me which would easily cause me to change my opinion if i were ignorant of the facts of the existence of god and thus i should have no true and certain knowledge but only vague and vacillating opinions  thus for example when i consider the nature of a rectilinear triangle i who have some little knowledge of the principles of geometry recognise quite clearly that the three angles are equal to two right angles and it is not possible for me not to believe this so long as i apply my mind to its demonstration but so soon as i abstain from attending to the proof although i still recollect having clearly comprehended it it may easily occur that i come to doubt its truth if i am ignorant of there being a god  for i can persuade myself of having been so constituted by nature that i can easily deceive myself even in those matters which i believe myself to apprehend with the greatest evidence and certainty especially when i recollect that i have frequently judged matters to be true and certain which other reasons have afterwards impelled me to judge to be altogether false       but after i have recognised that there is a god because at the same time i have also recognised that all things depend upon him and that he is not a deceiver and from that have inferred that what i perceive clearly and distinctly cannot fail to be true although i no longer pay attention to the reasons for which i have judged this to be true provided that i recollect having clearly and distinctly perceived it no contrary reason can be brought forward which could ever cause me to doubt of its truth and thus i have a true and certain knowledge of it  and this same knowledge extends likewise to all other things which i recollect having formerly demonstrated such as the truths of geometry and the like for what can be alleged against them to cause me to place them in doubt  will it be said that my nature is such as to cause me to be frequently deceived  but i already know that i cannot be deceived in the judgment whose grounds i know clearly will it be said that i formerly held many things to be true and certain which i have afterwards recognised to be false but i had not had any clear and distinct knowledge of these things and not as yet knowing the rule whereby i assure myself of the truth i had been impelled to give my assent from reasons which i have since recognised to be less strong than i had at the time imagined them to be  what further objection can then be raised  that possibly i am dreaming an objection i myself made a little while ago or that all the thoughts which i now have are no more true than the phantasies of my dreams  but even though i slept the case would be the same for all that is clearly present to my mind is absolutely true       and so i very clearly recognise that the certainty and truth of all knowledge depends alone on the knowledge of the true god in so much that before i knew him i could not have a perfect knowledge of any other thing  and now that i know him i have the means of acquiring a perfect knowledge of an infinitude of things not only of those which relate to god himself and other intellectual matters but also of those which pertain to corporeal nature in so far as it is the object of pure mathematics which have no concern with whether it exists or not                                 meditation vi                                          of the existence of material things and of the real          distinction between the soul and body of man       nothing further now remains but to inquire whether material things exist  and certainly i at least know that these may exist in so far as they are considered as the objects of pure mathematics since in this aspect i perceive them clearly and distinctly  for there is no doubt that god possesses the power to produce everything that i am capable of perceiving with distinctness and i have never deemed that anything was impossible for him unless i found a contradiction in attempting to conceive it clearly  further the faculty of imagination which i possess and of which experience tells me i make use when i apply myself to the consideration of material things is capable of persuading me of their existence for when i attentively consider what imagination is i find that it is nothing but a certain application of the faculty of knowledge to the body which is immediately present to it and which therefore exists       and to render this quite clear i remark in the first place the difference that exists between the imagination and pure intellection or conception23  for example when i imagine a triangle i do not conceive it only as a figure comprehended by three lines but i also apprehend24 these three lines as present by the power and inward vision of my mind25 and this is what i call imagining  but if i desire to think of a chiliagon i certainly conceive truly that it is a figure composed of a thousand sides just as easily as i conceive of a triangle that it is a figure of three sides only but i cannot in any way imagine the thousand sides of a chiliagon as i do the three sides of a triangle nor do i so to speak regard them as present with the eyes of my mind  and although in accordance with the habit i have formed of always employing the aid of my imagination when i think of corporeal things it may happen that in imagining a chiliagon i confusedly represent to myself some figure yet it is very evident that this figure is not a chiliagon since it in no way differs from that which i represent to myself when i think of a myriagon or any other manysided figure nor does it serve my purpose in discovering the properties which go to form the distinction between a chiliagon and other polygons but if the question turns upon a pentagon it is quite true that i can conceive its figure as well as that of a chiliagon without the help of my imagination but i can also imagine it by applying the attention of my mind to each of its five sides and at the same time to the space which they enclose and thus i clearly recognise that i have need of a particular effort of mind in order to effect the act of imagination such as i do not require in order to understand and this particular effort of mind clearly manifests the difference which exists between imagination and pure intellection26       i remark besides that this power of imagination which is in one inasmuch as it differs from the power of understanding is in no wise a necessary element in my nature or in my essence that is to say in the essence of my mind for although i did not possess it i should doubtless ever remain the same as i now am from which it appears that we might conclude that it depends on something which differs from me  and i easily conceive that if some body exists with which my mind is conjoined and united in such a way that it can apply itself to consider it when it pleases it may be that by this means it can imagine corporeal objects so that this mode of thinking differs from pure intellection only inasmuch as mind in its intellectual activity in some manner turns on itself and considers some of the ideas which it possesses in itself while in imagining it turns towards the body and there beholds in it something conformable to the idea which it has either conceived of itself or perceived by the senses  i easily understand i say that the imagination could be thus constituted if it is true that body exists and because i can discover no other convenient mode of explaining it i conjecture with probability that body does exist but this is only with probability and although i examine all things with care i nevertheless do not find that from this distinct idea of corporeal nature which i have in my imagination i can derive any argument from which there will necessarily be deduced the existence of body       but i am in the habit of imagining many other things besides this corporeal nature which is the object of pure mathematics to wit the colours sounds scents pain and other such things although less distinctly  and inasmuch as i perceive these things much better through the senses by the medium of which and by the memory they seem to have reached my imagination i believe that in order to examine them more conveniently it is right that i should at the same time investigate the nature of sense perception and that i should see if from the ideas which i apprehend by this mode of thought which i call feeling i cannot derive some certain proof of the existence of corporeal objects       and first of all i shall recall to my memory those matters which i hitherto held to be true as having perceived them through the senses and the foundations on which my belief has rested in the next place i shall examine the reasons which have since obliged me to place them in doubt in the last place i shall consider which of them i must now believe       first of all then i perceived that i had a head hands feet and all other members of which this body which i considered as a part or possibly even as the whole of myself is composed  further i was sensible that this body was placed amidst many others from which it was capable of being affected in many different ways beneficial and hurtful and i remarked that a certain feeling of pleasure accompanied those that were beneficial and pain those which were harmful  and in addition to this pleasure and pain i also experienced hunger thirst and other similar appetites as also certain corporeal inclinations towards joy sadness anger and other similar passions  and outside myself in addition to extension figure and motions of bodies i remarked in them hardness heat and all other tactice qualities and further light and colour and scents and sounds the variety of which gave me the means of distinguishing the sky the earth the sea and generally all the other bodies one from the other and certainly considering the ideas of all these qualities which presented themselves to my mind and which alone i perceived properly or immediately it was not without reason that i believed myself to perceive objects quite different from my thought to wit bodies from which those ideas proceeded for i found by experience that these ideas presented themselves to me without my consent being requisite so that i could not perceive any object however desirous i might be unless it were present to the organs of sense and it was not in my power not to perceive it when it was present  and because the ideas which i received through the senses were much more lively more clear and even in their own way more distinct than any of those which i could of myself frame in meditation or than those i found impressed on my memory it appeared as though they could not have proceeded from my mind so that they must necessarily have been produced in me by some other things  and having no knowledge of those objects excepting the knowledge which the ideas themselves gave me nothing was more likely to occur to my mind than that the objects were similar to the ideas which were caused  and because i likewise remembered that i had formerly made use of my senses rather than my reason and recognised that the ideas which i formed of myself were not so distinct as those which i perceived through the senses and that they were most frequently even composed of portions of these last i persuaded myself easily that i had no idea in my mind which had not formerly come to me through the senses  nor was it without some reason that i believed that this body which be a certain special right i call my own belonged to me more properly and more strictly than any other for in fact i could never be separated from it as from other bodies i experienced in it and on account of it all my appetites and affections and finally i was touched by the feeling of pain and the titillation of pleasure in its parts and not in the parts of other bodies which were separated from it  but when i inquired why from some i know not what painful sensation there follows sadness of mind and from the pleasurable sensation there arises joy or why this mysterious pinching of the stomach which i call hunger causes me to desire to eat and dryness of throat causes a desire to drink and so on i could give no reason excepting that nature taught me so for there is certainly no affinity that i at least can understand between the craving of the stomach and the desire to eat any more than between the perception of whatever causes pain and the thought of sadness which arises from this perception  and in the same way it appeared to me that i had learned from nature all the other judgments which i formed regarding the objects of my senses since i remarked that these judgments were formed in me before i had the leisure to weigh and consider any reasons which might oblige me to make them       but afterwards many experiences little by little destroyed all the faith which i had rested in my senses for i from time to time observed that those towers which from afar appeared to me to be round more closely observed seemed square and that colossal statues raised on the summit of these towers appeared as quite tiny statues when viewed from the bottom and so in an infinitude of other cases i found error in judgments founded on the external senses  and not only in those founded on the external senses but even in those founded on the internal as well for is there anything more intimate or more internal than pain  and yet i have learned from some persons whose arms or legs have been cut off that they sometimes seemed to feel pain in the part which had been amputated which made me think that i could not be quite certain that it was a certain member which pained me even although i felt pain in it  and to those grounds of doubt i have lately added two others which are very general the first is that i never have believed myself to feel anything in waking moments which i cannot also sometimes believe myself to feel when i sleep and as i do not think that these things which i seem to feel in sleep proceed from objects outside of me i do not see any reason why i should have this belief regarding objects which i seem to perceive while awake  the other was that being still ignorant or rather supposing myself to be ignorant of the author of my being i saw nothing to prevent me from having been so constituted by nature that i might be deceived even in matters which seemed to me to be most certain  and as to the grounds on which i was formerly persuaded of the truth of sensible objects i had not much trouble in replying to them  for since nature seemed to cause me to lean towards many things from which reason repelled me i did not believe that i should trust much to the teachings of nature  and although the ideas which i receive by the senses do not depend on my will i did not think that one should for that reason conclude that they proceeded from things different from myself since possibly some faculty might be discovered in me though hitherto unknown to me which produced them       but now that i begin to know myself better and to discover more clearly the author of my being i do not in truth think that i should rashly admit all the matters which the senses seem to teach us but on the other hand i do not think that i should doubt them all universally       and first of all because i know that all things which i apprehend clearly and distinctly can be created by god as i apprehend them it suffices that i am able to apprehend one thing apart from another clearly and distinctly in order to be certain that the one is different from the other since they may be made to exist in separation at least by the omnipotence of god and it does not signify by what power this separation is made in order to compel me to judge them to be different and therefore just because i know certainly that i exist and that meanwhile i do not remark that any other thing necessarily pertains to my nature or essence excepting that i am a thinking thing i rightly conclude that my essence consists solely in the fact that i am a thinking thin or a substance whose whole essence or nature is to think  and although possibly or rather certainly as i shall say in a moment i possess a body with which i am very intimately conjoined yet because on the one side i have a clear and distinct idea of myself inasmuch as i am only a thinking and unextended thing and as on the other i possess a distinct idea of body inasmuch as it is only an extended and unthinking thing it is certain that this i that is to say my soul by which i am what i am is entirely and absolutely distinct from my body and can exist without it       i further find in myself faculties imploying modes of thinking peculiar to themselves to wit the faculties of imagination and feeling without which i can easily conceive myself clearly and distinctly as a complete being while on the other hand they cannot be so conceived apart from me that is without an intelligent substance in which they reside for in the notion we have of these faculties or to use the language of the schools in their formal concept some kind of intellection is comprised from which i infer that they are distinct from me as its modes are from a thing  i observe also in me some other faculties such as that of change of position the assumption of different figures and such like which cannot be conceived any more than can the preceding apart from some substance to which they are attached and consequently cannot exist without it but it is very clear that these faculties if it be true that they exist must be attached to some corporeal or extended substance and not to an intelligent substance since in the clear and distinct conception of these there is some sort of extension found to be present but no intellection at all  there is certainly further in me a certain passive faculty of perception that is of receiving and recognising the ideas of sensible things but this would be useless to me and i could in no way avail myself of it if there were not either in me or in some other thing another active faculty capable of forming and producing these ideas  but this active faculty cannot exist in me inasmuch as i am a thing that thinks seeing that it does not presuppose thought and also that those ideas are often produced in me without my contributing in any way to the same and often even against my will it is thus necessarily the case that the faculty resides in some substance different from me in which all the reality which is objectively in the ideas that are produced by this faculty is formally or eminently contained as i remarked before  and this substance is either a body that is a corporeal nature in which there is contained formally and really all that which is objectively and by representation in those ideas or it is god himself or some other creature more noble than body in which that same is contained eminently  but since god is no deceiver it is very manifest that he does not communicate to me these ideas immediately and by himself nor yet by the intervention of some creature in which their reality is not formally but only eminently contained  for since he has given me no faculty to recognise that this is the case but on the other hand a very great inclination to believe that they are sent to me or that they are conveyed to me by corporeal objects i do not see how he could be defended from the accusation of deceit if these ideas were produced by causes other than corporeal objects  hence we must allow that corporeal things exist however they are perhaps not exactly what we perceive by the senses since this comprehension by the senses is in many instances very obscure and confused but we must at least admit that all things which i conceive in them clearly and distinctly that is to say all things which speaking generally are comprehended in the object of pure mathematics are truly to be recognised as external objects       as to other things however which are either particular only as for example that the sun is of such and such a figure etc or which are less clearly and distinctly conceived such as light sound pain and the like it is certain that although they are very dubious and uncertain yet on the sole ground that god is not a deceiver and that consequently he has not permitted any falsity to exist in my opinion which he has not likewise given me the faculty of correcting i may assuredly hope to conclude that i have within me the means of arriving at the truth even here  and first of all there is no doubt that in all things which nature teaches me there is some truth contained for by nature considered in general i now understand no other thing than either god himself or else the order and disposition which god has established in created things and by my nature in particular i understand no other thing than the complexus of all the things which god has given me       but there is nothing which this nature teaches me more expressly nor more sensibly than that i have a body which is adversely affected when i feel pain which has need of food or drink when i experience the feelings of hunger and thirst and so on nor can i doubt there being some truth in all this       nature also teaches me by these sensations of pain hunger thirst etc that i am not only lodged in my body as a pilot in a vessel but that i am not only lodged in my body as a pilot in a vessel but that i am very closely united to it and so to speak so intermingled with it that i seem to compose with it one whole  for if that were not the case when my body is hurt i who am merely a thinking thing should not feel pain for i should perceive this wound by the understanding only just as the sailor perceives by sight when something is damaged in his vessel and when my body has need of drink or food i should clearly understand the fact without being warned of it by confused feelings of hunger and thirst for all these sensations of hunger thirst pain etc are in truth none other than certain confused modes of thought which are produced by the union and apparent intermingling of mind and body       moreover nature teaches me that many other bodies exist around mine of which some are to be avoided and others sought after  and certainly from the fact that i am sensible of different sorts of colours sounds scents tastes heat hardness etc i very easily conclude that there are in the bodies from which all these diverse senseperceptions proceed certain variations which answer to them although possibly these are not really at all similar to them  and also from the fact that amongst these different senseperceptions some are very agreeable to me and others disagreeable it is quite certain that my body or rather myself in my entirety inasmuch as i am formed of body and soul may receive different impressions agreeable and disagreeable from the other bodies which surround it       but there are many other things which nature seems to have taught me but which at the same time i have never really received from her but which have been brought about in my mind by a certain habit which i have of forming inconsiderate judgments on things and thus it may easily happen that these judgments contain some error  take for example the opinion which i hold that all space in which there is nothing that affects or makes an impression on my senses is void that in a body which is warm there is something entirely similar to the idea of heat which is in me that in a white or green body there is the same whiteness or greenness that i perceive that in a bitter or sweet body there is the same taste and so on in other instances that the stars the towers and all other distant bodies are of the same figure and size as they appear from far off to our eyes etc  but in order that in this there should be nothing which i do not conceive distinctly i should define exactly what i really understand when i say that i am taught somewhat by nature  for here i take nature in a more limited signification than when i term it the sum of all the things given me by god since in this sum many things are comprehended which only pertain to mind and to these i do not refer in speaking of nature such as the notion which i have of the fact that what has once been done cannot ever be undone and an infinitude of such things which i know by the light of nature without the help of the body and seeing that it comprehends many other matters besides which only pertain to body and are no longer here contained under the name of nature such as the quality of weight which it possesses and the like with which i also do not deal for in talking of nature i only treat of those things given by god to me as a being composed of mind and body  but the nature here described truly teaches me to flee from things which cause the sensation of pain and seek after the things which communicate to me the sentiment of pleasure and so forth but i do not see that beyond this it teaches me that from those diverse sense perceptions we should ever form any conclusion regarding things outside of us without having carefully and maturely mentally examined them beforehand  for it seems to me that it is mind alone and not mind and body in conjunction that is requisite to a knowledge of the truth in regard to such things  thus although a star makes no larger an impression on my eye than the flame of a little candle there is yet in me no real or positive propensity impelling me to believe that it is not greater than that flame but i have judged it to be so from my earliest years without any rational foundation  and although in approaching fire i feel heat and in approaching it a little too near i even feel pain there is at the same time no reason in this which could persuade me that there is in the fire something resembling this heat any more than there is in it something resembling the pain all that i have any reason to believe from this is that there is something in it whatever it may be which excites in me these sensations of heat or of pain  so also although there are spaces in which i find nothing which excites my senses i must not from that conclude that these spaces contain no body for i see in this as in other similar things that i have been in the habit of perverting the order of nature because these perceptions of sense having bee placed within me by nature merely for the purpose of signifying to my mind what things are beneficial or hurtful to the composite whole of which it forms a part and being up to that point sufficiently clear and distinct i yet avail myself of them as though they were absolute rules by which i might immediately determine the essence of the bodies which are outside me as to which in fact they can teach me nothing but what is most obscure and confused       but i have already sufficiently considered how notwithstanding the supreme goodness of god falsity enters into the judgments i make  only here a new difficulty is presented one respecting those things the pursuit or avoidance of which is taught me by nature and also respecting the internal sensations which i possess and in which i seem to have sometimes detected error and thus to be directly deceived by my own nature  to take an example the agreeable taste of some food in which poison has been intermingled may induce me to partake of the poison and thus deceive me  it is true at the same time that in this case nature may be excused for it only induces me to desire food in which i find a pleasant taste and not to desire the poison which is unknown to it and thus i can infer nothing from this fact except that my nature is not omniscient at which there is certainly no reason to be astonished since man being finite in nature can only have knowledge the perfectness of which is limited       but we not unfrequently deceive ourselves even in those things to which we are directly impelled by nature as happens with those who when they are sick desire to drink or eat things hurtful to them  it will perhaps be said here that the cause of their deceptiveness is that their nature is corrupt but that does not remove the difficulty because a sick man is none the less truly gods creature than he who is in health and it is therefore as repugnant to gods goodness for the one to have a deceitful nature as it is for the other  and as a clock composed of wheels and counterweights no less exactly observes the laws of nature when it is badly made and does not show the time properly than when it entirely satisfies the wishes of its maker and as if i consider the body of a man as being a sort of machine so built up and composed of nerves muscles veins blood and skin that though there were no mind in it at all it would not cease to have the same motions as at present exception being made of those movements which are due to the direction of the will and in consequence depend upon the mind as apposed to those which operate by the disposition of its organs i easily recognise that it would be as natural to this body supposing it to be for example dropsical to suffer the parchedness of the throat which usually signifies to the mind the feeling of thirst and to be disposed by this parched feeling to move the nerves and other parts in the way requisite for drinking and thus to augment its malady and do harm to itself as it is natural to it when it has no indisposition to be impelled to drink for its good by a similar cause  and although considering the use to which the clock has been destined by its maker i may say that it deflects from the order of its nature when it does not indicate the hours correctly and as in the same way considering the machine of the human body as having been formed by god in order to have in itself all the movements usually manifested there i have reason for thinking that it does not follow the order of nature when if the throat is dry drinking does harm to the conservation of health nevertheless i recognise at the same time that this last mode of explaining nature is very different from the other  for this is but a purely verbal characterisation depending entirely on my thought which compares a sick man and a badly constructed clock with the idea which i have of a healthy man and a well made clock and it is hence extrinsic to the things to which it is applied but according to the other interpretation of the term nature i understand something which is truly found in things and which is therefore not without some truth       but certainly although in regard to the dropsical body it is only so to speak to apply an extrinsic term when we say that its nature is corrupted inasmuch as apart from the need to drink the throat is parched yet in regard to the composite whole that is to say to the mind or soul united to this body it is not a purely verbal predicate but a real error of nature for it to have thirst when drinking would be hurtful to it  and thus it still remains to inquire how the goodness of god does not prevent the nature of man so regarded from being fallacious       in order to begin this examination then i here say in the first place that there is a great difference between mind and body inasmuch as body is by nature always divisible and the mind is entirely indivisible  for as a matter of fact when i consider the mind that is to say myself inasmuch as i am only a thinking thing i cannot distinguish in myself any parts but apprehend myself to be clearly one and entire and although the whole mind seems to be united to the whole body yet if a foot or an arm or some other part is separated from my body i am aware that nothing has been taken away from my mind  and the faculties of willing feeling conceiving etc cannot be properly speaking said to be its parts for it is one and the same mind which employs itself in willing and in feeling and understanding  but it is quite otherwise with corporeal or extended objects for there is not one of these imaginable by me which my mind cannot easily divide into parts and which consequently i do not recognise as being divisible this would be sufficient to teach me that the mind or soul of man is entirely different from the body if i had not already learned it from other sources       i further notice that the mind does not receive the impressions from all parts of the body immediately but only from the brain or perhaps even from one of its smallest parts to wit from that in which the common sense27 is said to reside which whenever it is disposed in the same particular way conveys the same thing to the mind although meanwhile the other portions of the body may be differently disposed as is testified by innumerable experiments which it is unnecessary here to recount       i notice also that the nature of body is such that none of its parts can be moved by another part a little way off which cannot also be moved in the same way by each one of the parts which are between the two although this more remote part does not act at all  as for example in the cord abcd which is in tension if we pull the last part d the first part a will not be moved in any way differently from what would be the case if one of the intervening parts b or c were pulled and the last part d were to remain unmoved  and in the same way when i feel pain in my foot my knowledge of physics teaches me that this sensation is communicated by means of nerves dispersed through the foot which being extended like cords from there to the brain when they are contracted in the foot at the same time contract the inmost portions of the brain which is their extremity and place of origin and then excite a certain movement which nature has established in order to cause the mind to be affected by a sensation of pain represented as existing in the foot  but because these nerves must pass through the tibia the thigh the loins the back and the neck in order to reach from the leg to the brain it may happen that although their extremities which are in the foot are not affected but only certain ones of their intervening parts which pass by the loins or the neck this action will excite the same movement in the brain that might have been excited there by a hurt received in the foot in consequence of which the mind will necessarily feel in the foot the same pain as if it had received a hurt  and the same holds good of all the other perceptions of our senses       i notice finally that since each of the movements which are in the portion of the brain by which the mind is immediately affected brings about one particular sensation only we cannot under the circumstances imagine anything more likely than that this movement amongst all the sensations which it is capable of impressing on it causes mind to be affected by that one which is best fitted and most generally useful for the conservation of the human body when it is in health  but  experience makes us aware that all the feelings with which nature inspires us are such as i have just spoken of and there is therefore nothing in them which does not give testimony to the power and goodness of the god who has produced them28  thus for example when the nerves which are in the feet are violently or more than usually moved their movement passing through the medulla of the spine29 to the inmost parts of the brain gives a sign to the mind which makes it feel somewhat to wit pain as though in the foot by which the mind is excited to do its utmost to remove the cause of the evil as dangerous and hurtful to the foot  it is true that god could have constituted the nature of man in such a way that this same movement in the brain would have conveyed something quite different to the mind for example it might have produced consciousness of itself either in so far as it is in the brain or as it is in the foot or as it is in some other place between the foot and the brain or it might finally have produced consciousness of anything else whatsoever but none of all this would have contributed so well to the conservation of the body  similarly when we desire to drink a certain dryness of the throat is produced which moves its nerves and by their means the internal portions of the brain and this movement causes in the mind the sensation of thirst because in this case there is nothing more useful to us than to become aware that we have need to drink for the conservation o our health and the same holds good in other instances       from this it is quite clear that notwithstanding the supreme goodness of god the nature of man inasmuch as it is composed of mind and body cannot be otherwise than sometimes a source of deception  for if there is any cause which excites not in the foot but in some part of the nerves which are extended between the foot and the brain or even in the brain itself the same movement which usually is produced when the foot is detrimentally affected pain will be experienced as though it were in the foot and the sense will thus naturally be deceived for since the same movement in the brain is capable of causing but one sensation in the mind and this sensation is much more frequently excited by a cause which hurts the foot than by another existing in some other quarter it is reasonable that it should convey to the mind pain in the foot rather than in any other part of the body and although the parchedness of the throat does not always proceed as it usually does from the fact that drinking is necessary for the health of the body but sometimes comes from quite a different cause as is the case with dropsical patients it is yet much better that it should mislead on this occasion than if on the other hand it were always to deceive us when the body is in good health and so on in similar cases       and certainly this consideration is of great service to me not only in enabling me to recognise all the errors to which my nature is subject but also in enabling me to avoid them or to correct them more easily  for knowing that all my senses more frequently indicate to me truth than falsehood respecting the things which concern that which is beneficial to the body and being able almost always to avail myself of many of them in order to examine one particular thing and besides that being able to make use of my memory in order to connect the present with the past and of my understanding which already has discovered all the causes of my errors i ought no longer to fear that falsity may be found in matters every day presented to me by my senses  and i ought to set aside all the doubts of these past days as hyperbolical and ridiculous particularly that very common uncertainty respecting sleep which i could not distinguish from the waking state for at present i find a very notable difference between the two inasmuch as our memory can never connect our dreams one with the other or with the whole course of our lives as it unites events which happen to us while we are awake  and as a matter of fact if someone while i was awake quite suddenly appeared to me and disappeared as fast as do the images which i see in sleep so that i could not know from whence the form came nor whither it went it would not be without reason that i should deem it a spectre or a phantom formed by my brain and similar to those which i form in sleep rather than a real man  but when i perceive things as to which i know distinctly both the place from which they proceed and that in which they are and the time at which they appeared to me and when without any interruption i can connect the perceptions which i have of them with the whole course of my life i am perfectly assured that these perceptions occur while i am waking and not during sleep  and i ought in no wise to doubt the truth of such matters if after having called up all my senses my memory and my understanding to examine them nothing is brought to evidence by any one of them which is repugnant to what is set forth by the others  for because god is in no wise a deceiver it follows that i am not deceived in this  but because the exigencies of action often oblige us to make up our minds before having leisure to examine matters carefully we must confess that the life of man is very frequently subject to error in respect to individual objects and we must in the end acknowledge the infirmity of our nature  1copyright 1996 james fieser jfieserutmedu all rights reserved unaltered copies of this computer text
