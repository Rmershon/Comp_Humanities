few feet of rock and began to pick his way toward the lagoon though he had taken off his school sweater and trailed it now from one hand his grey shirt stuck to him and his hair was plastered to his forehead all round him the long scar smashed into the jungle was a bath of heat he was clambering heavily among the creepers and broken trunks when a bird a vision of red and yellow flashed upwards with a witchlike cry and this cry was echoed by another 	hi it said wait a minute 	the undergrowth at the side of the scar was shaken and a multitude of raindrops fell pattering 	wait a minute the voice said i got caught up 	the fair boy stopped and jerked his stockings with an automatic gesture that made the jungle seem for a moment like the home counties 	the voice spoke again 	i cant hardly move with all these creeper things 	the owner of the voice came backing out of the undergrowth so that twigs scratched on a greasy windbreaker the naked crooks of his knees were plump caught and scratched by thorns he bent down removed the thorns carefully and turned around he was shorter than the fair boy and very fat he came forward searching out safe lodgments for his feet and then looked up through thick spectacles 	wheres the man with the megaphone 	the fair boy shook his head 	this is an island at least i think its an island thats a reef out in the sea perhaps there arent any grownups anywhere 	the fat boy looked startled 	there was that pilot but he wasnt in the passenger cabin he was up in front 	the fair boy was peering at the reef through screwedup eyes 	all them other kids the fat boy went on some of them must have got out they must have mustnt they 	the fair boy began to pick his way as casually as possible toward the water he tried to be offhand and not too obviously uninterested but the fat boy hurried after him 	arent there any grownups at all 	i dont think so 	the fair boy said this solemnly but then the delight of a realized ambition overcame him in the middle of the scar he stood on his head and grinned at the reversed fat boy 	no grownups 	the fat boy thought for a moment 	that pilot 	the fair boy allowed his feet to come down and sat on the steamy earth 	he must have flown off after he dropped us he couldnt land here not in a place with wheels 	we was attacked 	hell be back all right 	the fat boy shook his head 	when we was coming down i looked through one of them windows i saw the other part of the plane there were flames coming out of it 	he looked up and down the scar 	and this is what the cabin done 	the fair boy reached out and touched the jagged end of a trunk for a moment he looked interested 	what happened to it he asked wheres it got to now 	that storm dragged it out to sea it wasnt half dangerous with all them tree trunks falling there must have been some kids still in it 	he hesitated for a moment then spoke again 	whats your name 	ralph 	the fat boy waited to be asked his name in turn but this proffer of acquaintance was not made the fair boy called ralph smiled vaguely stood up and began to make his way once more toward the lagoon the fat boy hung steadily at his shoulder 	i expect theres a lot more of us scattered about you havent seen any others have you 	ralph shook his head and increased his speed then he tripped over a branch and came down with a crash 	the fat boy stood by him breathing hard 	my auntie told me not to run he explained on account of my asthma 	assmar 	thats right cant catch my breath i was the only boy in our school what had asthma said the fat boy with a touch of pride and ive been wearing specs since i was three 	he took off his glasses and held them out to ralph blinking and smiling and then started to wipe them against his grubby windbreaker an expression of pain and inward concentration altered the pale contours of his face he smeared the sweat from his cheeks and quickly adjusted the spectacles on his nose 	them fruit 	he glanced round the scar 	them fruit he said i expect 	he put on his glasses waded away from ralph and crouched down among the tangled foliage 	ill be out again in just a minute 	ralph disentangled himself cautiously and stole away through the branches in a few seconds the fat boys grunts were behind him and he was hurrying toward the screen that still lay between him and the lagoon he climbed over a broken trunk and was out of the jungle 	the shore was fledged with palm trees these stood or leaned or reclined against the light and their green feathers were a hundred feet up in the air the ground beneath them was a bank covered with coarse grass torn everywhere by the upheavals of fallen trees scattered with decaying coconuts and palm saplings behind this was the darkness of the forest proper and the open space of the scar ralph stood one hand against a grey trunk and screwed up his eyes against the shimmering water out there perhaps a mile away the white surf flinked on a coral reef and beyond that the open sea was dark blue within the irregular arc of coral the lagoon was still as a mountain lakeblue of all shades and shadowy green and purple the beach between the palm terrace and the water was a thin stick endless apparently for to ralphs left the perspectives of palm and beach and water drew to a point at infinity and always almost visible was the heat 	he jumped down from the terrace the sand was thick over his black shoes and the heat hit him he became conscious of the weight of clothes kicked his shoes off fiercely and ripped off each stocking with its elastic garter in a single movement then he leapt back on the terrace pulled off his shirt and stood there among the skulllike coconuts with green shadows from the palms and the forest sliding over his skin he undid the snakeclasp of his belt lugged off his shorts and pants and stood there naked looking at the dazzling beach and the water 	he was old enough twelve years and a few months to have lost the prominent tummy of childhood and not yet old enough for adolescence to have made him awkward you could see now that he might make a boxer as far as width and heaviness of shoulders went but there was a mildness about his mouth and eyes that proclaimed no devil he patted the palm trunk softly and forced at last to believe in the reality of the island laughed delightedly again and stood on his head he turned neatly on to his feet jumped down to the beach knelt and swept a double armful of sand into a pile against his chest then he sat back and looked at the water with bright excited eyes 	ralph 	the fat boy lowered himself over the terrace and sat down carefully using the edge as a seat 	im sorry i been such a time them fruit 	he wiped his glasses and adjusted them on his button nose the frame had made a deep pink v on the bridge he looked critically at ralphs golden body and then down at his own clothes he laid a hand on the end of a zipper that extended down his chest 	my auntie 	then he opened the zipper with decision and pulled the whole windbreaker over his head 	there 	ralph looked at him sidelong and said nothing 	i expect well want to know all their names said the fat boy and make a list we ought to have a meeting 	ralph did not take the hint so the fat boy was forced to continue 	i dont care what they call me he said confidentially so long as they dont call me what they used to call me at school 	ralph was faintly interested 	what was that 	the fat boy glanced over his shoulder then leaned toward ralph 	he whispered 	they used to call me piggy 	ralph shrieked with laughter he jumped up 	piggy piggy 	ralphplease 	piggy clasped his hands in apprehension 	i said i didnt want 	piggy piggy 	ralph danced out into the hot air of the beach and then returned as a fighterplane with wings swept back and machinegunned piggy 	scheaaow 	he dived in the sand at piggys feet and lay there laughing 	piggy 	piggy grinned reluctantly pleased despite himself at even this much recognition 	so long as you dont tell the others 	ralph giggled into the sand the expression of pain and concentration returned to piggys face 	half a sec 	he hastened back into the forest ralph stood up and trotted along to the right 	here the beach was interrupted abruptly by the square motif of the landscape a great platform of pink granite thrust up uncompromisingly through forest and terrace and sand and lagoon to make a raised jetty four feet high the top of this was covered with a thin layer of soil and coarse grass and shaded with young palm trees there was not enough soil for them to grow to any height and when they reached perhaps twenty feet they fell and dried forming a crisscross pattern of trunks very convenient to sit on the palms that still stood made a green roof covered on the underside with a quivering tangle of reflections from the lagoon ralph hauled himself onto this platform noted the coolness and shade shut one eye and decided that the shadows on his body were really green he picked his way to the seaward edge of the platform and stood looking down into the water it was clear to the bottom and bright with the efflorescence of tropical weed and coral a school of tiny glittering fish flicked hither and thither ralph spoke to himself sounding the bass strings of delight 	whizzoh 	beyond the platform there was more enchantment some act of goda typhoon perhaps or the storm that had accompanied his own arrivalhad banked sand inside the lagoon so that there was a long deep pool in the beach with a high ledge of pink granite at the further end ralph had been deceived before now by the specious appearance of depth in a beach pool and he approached this one preparing to be disappointed but the island ran true to form and the incredible pool which clearly was only invaded by the sea at high tide was so deep at one end as to be dark green ralph inspected the whole thirty yards carefully and then plunged in the water was warmer than his blood and he might have been swimming in a huge bath 	piggy appeared again sat on the rocky ledge and watched ralphs green and white body enviously 	you cant half swim 	piggy 	piggy took off his shoes and socks ranged them carefully on the ledge and tested the water with one toe 	its hot 	what did you expect 	i didnt expect nothing my auntie 	sucks to your auntie 	ralph did a surface dive and swam under water with his eyes open the sandy edge of the pool loomed up like a hillside he turned over holding his nose and a golden light danced and shattered just over his face piggy was looking determined and began to take off his shorts presently he was palely and fatly naked he tiptoed down the sandy side of the pool and sat there up to his neck in water smiling proudly at ralph 	arent you going to swim 	piggy shook his head 	i cant swim i wasnt allowed my asthma 	sucks to your assmar 	piggy bore this with a sort of humble patience you cant half swim well 	ralph paddled backwards down the slope immersed his mouth and blew a jet of water into the air then he lifted his chin and spoke 	i could swim when i was five daddy taught me hes a commander in the navy when he gets leave hell come and rescue us whats your father 	piggy flushed suddenly 	my dads dead he said quickly and my mum 	he took off his glasses and looked vainly for something with which to clean them 	i used to live with my auntie she kept a candy store i used to get ever so many candies as many as i liked whenll your dad rescue us 	soon as he can 	piggy rose dripping from the water and stood naked cleaning his glasses with a sock the only sound that reached them now through the heat of the morning was the long grinding roar of the breakers on the reef 	how does he know were here 	ralph lolled in the water sleep enveloped him like the swathing mirages that were wrestling with the brilliance of the lagoon 	how does he know were here 	because thought ralph because because the roar from the reef became very distant 	theyd tell him at the airport 	piggy shook his head put on his flashing glasses and looked down at ralph 	not them didnt you hear what the pilot said about the atom bomb theyre all dead 	ralph pulled himself out of the water stood facing piggy and considered this unusual problem 	piggy persisted 	this an island isnt it 	i climbed a rock said ralph slowly and i think this is an island 	theyre all dead said piggy an this is an island nobody dont know were here your dad dont know nobody dont know 	his lips quivered and the spectacles were dimmed with mist 	we may stay here till we die 	with that word the heat seemed to increase till it became a threatening weight and the lagoon attacked them with a blinding effulgence 	get my clothes muttered ralph along there 	he trotted through the sand enduring the suns enmity crossed the platform and found his scattered clothes to put on a grey shirt once more was strangely pleasing then he climbed the edge of the platform and sat in the green shade on a convenient trunk piggy hauled himself up carrying most of his clothes under his arms then he sat carefully on a fallen trunk near the little cliff that fronted the lagoon and the tangled reflections quivered over him 	presently he spoke 	we got to find the others we got to do something 	ralph said nothing here was a coral island protected from the sun ignoring piggys illomened talk he dreamed pleasantly 	piggy insisted 	how many of us are there 	ralph came forward and stood by piggy 	i dont know 	here and there little breezes crept over the polished waters beneath the haze of heat when these breezes reached the platform the palm fronds would whisper so that spots of blurred sunlight slid over their bodies or moved like bright winged things in the shade 	piggy looked up at ralph all the shadows on ralphs face were reversed green above bright below from the lagoon a blur of sunlight was crawling across his hair 	we got to do something 	ralph looked through him here at last was the imagined but never fully realized place leaping into real life ralphs lips parted in a delighted smile and piggy taking this smile to himself as a mark of recognition laughed with pleasure 	if it really is an island 	whats that 	ralph had stopped smiling and was pointing into the lagoon something creamy lay among the ferny weeds 	a stone 	no a shell 	suddenly piggy was abubble with decorous excitement 	sright its a shell i seen one like that before on someones back wall a conch he called it he used to blow it and then his mum would come its ever so valuable 	near to ralphs elbow a palm sapling leaned out over the lagoon indeed the weight was already pulling a lump from the poor soil and soon it would fall he tore out the stem and began to poke about in the water while the brilliant fish flicked away on this side and that piggy leaned dangerously 	careful youll break it 	shut up 	ralph spoke absently the shell was interesting and pretty and a worthy plaything but the vivid phantoms of his daydream still interposed between him and piggy who in this context was an irrelevance the palm sapling bending pushed the shell across the weeds ralph used one hand as a fulcrum and pressed down with the other till the shell rose dripping and piggy could make a grab 	now the shell was no longer a thing seen but not to be touched ralph too became excited piggy babbled 	a conch ever so expensive i bet if you wanted to buy one youd have to pay pounds and pounds and poundshe had it on his garden wall and my auntie 	ralph took the shell from piggy and a little water ran down his arm in color the shell was deep cream touched here and there with fading pink between the point worn away into a little hole and the pink lips of the mouth lay eighteen inches of shell with a slight spiral twist and covered with a delicate embossed pattern ralph shook sand out of the deep tube 	mooed like a cow he said he had some white stones too an a bird cage with a green parrot he didnt blow the white stones of course an he said 	piggy paused for breath and stroked the glistening thing that lay in ralphs hands 	ralph 	ralph looked up 	we can use this to call the others have a meeting theyll come when they hear us 	he beamed at ralph 	that was what you meant didnt you thats why you got the conch out of the water 	ralph pushed back his fair hair 	how did your friend blow the conch 	he kind of spat said piggy my auntie wouldnt let me blow on account of my asthma he said you blew from down here piggy laid a hand on his jutting abdomen you try ralph youll call the others 	doubtfully ralph laid the small end of the shell against his mouth and blew there came a rushing sound from its mouth but nothing more ralph wiped the salt water off his lips and tried again but the shell remained silent 	he kind of spat 	ralph pursed his lips and squirted air into the shell which emitted a low farting noise this amused both boys so much that ralph went on squirting for some minutes between bouts of laughter 	he blew from down here 	ralph grasped the idea and hit the shell with air from his diaphragm immediately the thing sounded a deep harsh note boomed under the palms spread through the intricacies of the forest and echoed back from the pink granite of the mountain clouds of birds rose from the treetops and something squealed and ran in the undergrowth 	ralph took the shell away from his lips 	gosh 	his ordinary voice sounded like a whisper after the harsh note of the conch he laid the conch against his lips took a deep breath and blew once more the note boomed again and then at his firmer pressure the note fluking up an octave became a strident blare more penetrating than before piggy was shouting something his face pleased his glasses flashing the birds cried small animals scuttered ralphs breath failed the note dropped the octave became a low wubber was a rush of air 	the conch was silent a gleaming tusk ralphs face was dark with breathlessness and the air over the island was full of birdclamor and echoes ringing 	i bet you can hear that for miles 	ralph found his breath and blew a series of short blasts 	piggy exclaimed theres one 	a child had appeared among the palms about a hundred yards along the beach he was a boy of perhaps six years sturdy and fair his clothes torn his face covered with a sticky mess of fruit his trousers had been lowered for an obvious purpose and had only been pulled back halfway he jumped off the palm terrace into the sand and his trousers fell about his ankles he stepped out of them and trotted to the platform piggy helped him up meanwhile ralph continued to blow till voices shouted in the forest the small boy squatted in front of ralph looking up brightly and vertically as he received the reassurance of something purposeful being done he began to look satisfied and his only clean digit a pink thumb slid into his mouth 	piggy leaned down to him 	whats yer name 	johnny 	piggy muttered the name to himself and then shouted it to ralph who was not interested because he was still blowing his face was dark with the violent pleasure of making this stupendous noise and his heart was making the stretched shirt shake the shouting in the forest was nearer 	signs of life were visible now on the beach the sand trembling beneath the heat haze concealed many figures in its miles of length boys were making their way toward the platform through the hot dumb sand three small children no older than johnny appeared from startlingly close at hand where they had been gorging fruit in the forest a dark little boy not much younger than piggy parted a tangle of undergrowth walked on to the platform and smiled cheerfully at everybody more and more of them came taking their cue from the innocent johnny they sat down on the fallen palm trunks and waited ralph continued to blow short penetrating blasts piggy moved among the crowd asking names and frowning to remember them the children gave him the same simple obedience that they had given to the men with megaphones some were naked and carrying their clothes others halfnaked or more or less dressed in school uniforms grey blue fawn jacketed or jerseyed there were badges mottoes even stripes of color in stockings and pullovers their heads clustered above the trunks in the green shade heads brown fair black chestnut sandy mousecolored heads muttering whispering heads full of eyes that watched ralph and speculated something was being done 	the children who came along the beach singly or in twos leapt into visibility when they crossed the line from heat haze to nearer sand here the eye was first attracted to a black batlike creature that danced on the sand and only later perceived the body above it the bat was the childs shadow shrunk by the vertical sun to a patch between the hurrying feet even while he blew ralph noticed the last pair of bodies that reached the platform above a fluttering patch of black the two boys bulletheaded and with hair like tow flung themselves down and lay grinning and panting at ralph like dogs they were twins and the eye was shocked and incredulous at such cheery duplication they breathed together they grinned together they were chunky and vital they raised wet lips at ralph for they seemed provided with not quite enough skin so that their profiles were blurred and their mouths pulled open piggy bent his flashing glasses to them and could be heard between the blasts repeating their names 	sam eric sam eric 	then he got muddled the twins shook their heads and pointed at each other and the crowd laughed 	at last ralph ceased to blow and sat there the conch trailing from one hand his head bowed on his knees as the echoes died away so did the laughter and there was silence 	within the diamond haze of the beach something dark was fumbling along ralph saw it first and watched till the intentness of his gaze drew all eyes that way then the creature stepped from mirage on to clear sand and they saw that the darkness was not all shadow but mostly clothing the creature was a party of boys marching approximately in step in two parallel lines and dressed in strangely eccentric clothing shorts shirts and different garments they carried in their hands but each boy wore a square black cap with a silver badge on it their bodies from throat to ankle were hidden by black cloaks which bore a long silver cross on the left breast and each neck was finished off with a hambone frill the heat of the tropics the descent the search for food and now this sweaty march along the blazing beach had given them the complexions of newly washed plums the boy who controlled them was dressed in the same way though his cap badge was golden when his party was about ten yards from the platform he shouted an order and they halted gasping sweating swaying in the fierce light the boy himself came forward vaulted on to the platform with his cloak flying and peered into what to him was almost complete darkness 	wheres the man with the trumpet 	ralph sensing his sunblindness answered him 	theres no man with a trumpet only me 	the boy came close and peered down at ralph screwing up his face as he did so what he saw of the fairhaired boy with the creamy shell on his knees did not seem to satisfy him he turned quickly his black cloak circling 	isnt there a ship then 	inside the floating cloak he was tall thin and bony and his hair was red beneath the black cap his face was crumpled and freckled and ugly without silliness out of this face stared two light blue eyes frustrated now and turning or ready to turn to anger 	isnt there a man here 	ralph spoke to his back 	no were having a meeting come and join in 	the group of cloaked boys began to scatter from close line the tall boy shouted at them 	choir stand still 	wearily obedient the choir huddled into line and stood there swaying in the sun none the less some began to protest faintly 	but merridew please merridew    cant we 	then one of the boys flopped on his face in the sand and the line broke up they heaved the fallen boy to the platform and let him lie merridew his eyes staring made the best of a bad job 	all right then sit down let him alone 	but merridew 	hes always throwing a faint said merridew he did in gib and addis and at matins over the precentor 	this last piece of shop brought sniggers from the choir who perched like black birds on the crisscross trunks and examined ralph with interest piggy asked no names he was intimidated by this uniformed superiority and the offhand authority in merridews voice he shrank to the other side of ralph and busied himself with his glasses 	merridew turned to ralph 	arent there any grownups 	no 	merridew sat down on a trunk and looked round the circle 	then well have to look after ourselves  	secure on the other side of ralph piggy spoke timidly  	thats why ralph made a meeting so as we can decide what to do weve heard names thats johnny those twotheyre twins sam n eric which is eric you noyoure sam 	im sam 	n im eric 	wed better all have names said ralph so im ralph 	we got most names said piggy got em just now 	kids names said merridew why should i be jack im merridew 	ralph turned to him quickly this was the voice of one who knew his own mind 	then went on piggy that boyi forget 	youre talking too much said jack merridew shut up fatty 	laughter arose 	hes not fatty cried ralph his real names piggy 	piggy 	piggy 	oh piggy 	a storm of laughter arose and even the tiniest child joined in for the moment the boys were a closed circuit of sympathy with piggy outside he went very pink bowed his head and cleaned his glasses again 	finally the laughter died away and the naming continued there was maurice next in size among the choir boys to jack but broad and grinning all the time there was a slight furtive boy whom no one knew who kept to himself with an inner intensity of avoidance and secrecy he muttered that his name was roger and was silent again bill robert harold henry the choir boy who had fainted sat up against a palm trunk smiled pallidly at ralph and said that his name was simon 	jack spoke 	weve got to decide about being rescued 	there was a buzz one of the small boys henry said that he wanted to go home 	shut up said ralph absently he lifted the conch seems to me we ought to have a chief to decide things 	a chief a chief 	i ought to be chief said jack with simple arrogance because im chapter chorister and head boy i can sing c sharp 	another buzz 	well then said jack i 	he hesitated the dark boy roger stirred at last and spoke up 	lets have a vote 	yes 	vote for chief 	lets vote 	this toy of voting was almost as pleasing as the conch jack started to protest but the clamor changed from the general wish for a chief to an election by acclaim of ralph himself none of the boys could have found good reason for this what intelligence had been shown was traceable to piggy while the most obvious leader was jack but there was a stillness about ralph as he sat that marked him out there was his size and attractive appearance and most obscurely yet most powerfully there was the conch the being that had blown that had sat waiting for them on the platform with the delicate thing balanced on his knees was set apart 	him with the shell 	ralph ralph 	let him be chief with the trumpetthing 	ralph raised a hand for silence 	all right who wants jack for chief 	with dreary obedience the choir raised their hands 	who wants me 	every hand outside the choir except piggys was raised immediately then piggy too raised his hand grudgingly into the air 	ralph counted 	im chief then 	the circle of boys broke into applause even the choir applauded and the freckles on jacks face disappeared under a blush of mortification he started up then changed his mind and sat down again while the air rang ralph looked at him eager to offer something 	the choir belongs to you of course 	they could be the army 	or hunters 	they could be 	the suffusion drained away from jacks face ralph waved again for silence 	jacks in charge of the choir they can bewhat do you want them to be 	hunters 	jack and ralph smiled at each other with shy liking the rest began to talk eagerly 	jack stood up 	all right choir take off your togs 	as if released from class the choir boys stood up chattered piled their black cloaks on the grass jack laid his on the trunk by ralph his grey shorts were sticking to him with sweat ralph glanced at them admiringly and when jack saw his glance he explained 	i tried to get over that hill to see if there was water all round but your shell called us 	ralph smiled and held up the conch for silence 	listen everybody ive got to have time to think things out i cant decide what to do straight off if this isnt an island we might be rescued straight away so weve got to decide if this is an island everybody must stay round here and wait and not go away three of usif we take more wed get all mixed and lose each otherthree of us will go on an expedition and find out ill go and jack and and    	he looked round the circle of eager faces there was no lack of boys to choose from 	and simon 	the boys round simon giggled and he stood up laughing a little now that the pallor of his faint was over he was a skinny vivid little boy with a glance coming up from under a hut of straight hair that hung down black and coarse 	he nodded at ralph 	ill come 	and i 	jack snatched from behind him a sizable sheathknife and clouted it into a trunk the buzz rose and died away 	piggy stirred 	ill come 	ralph turned to him 	youre no good on a job like this 	all the same 	we dont want you said jack flatly threes enough 	piggys glasses flashed 	i was with him when he found the conch i was with him before anyone else was 	jack and the others paid no attention there was a general dispersal ralph jack and simon jumped off the platform and walked along the sand past the bathing pool piggy hung bumbling behind them 	if simon walks in the middle of us said ralph then we could talk over his head 	the three of them fell into step this meant that every now and then simon had to do a double shuffle to catch up with the others presently ralph stopped and turned back to piggy 	look 	jack and simon pretended to notice nothing they walked on  	you cant come 	piggys glasses were misted againthis time with humiliation 	you told em after what i said 	his face flushed his mouth trembled 	after i said i didnt want 	what on earth are you talking about 	about being called piggy i said i didnt care as long as they didnt call me piggy an i said not to tell and then you went an said straight out 	stillness descended on them ralph looking with more understanding at piggy saw that he was hurt and crushed he hovered between the two courses of apology or further insult 	better piggy than fatty he said at last with the directness of genuine leadership and anyway im sorry if you feel like that now go back piggy and take names thats your job so long 	he turned and raced after the other two piggy stood and the rose of indignation faded slowly from his cheeks he went back to the platform 	the three boys walked briskly on the sand the tide was low and there was a strip of weedstrewn beach that was almost as firm as a road a kind of glamour was spread over them and the scene and they were conscious of the glamour and made happy by it they turned to each other laughing excitedly talking not listening the air was bright ralph faced by the task of translating all this into an explanation stood on his head and fell over when they had done laughing simon stroked ralphs arm shyly and they had to laugh again 	come on said jack presently were explorers 	well go to the end of the island said ralph and look round the corner 	if it is an island 	now toward the end of the afternoon the mirages were settling a little they found the end of the island quite distinct and not magicked out of shape or sense there was a jumble of the usual squareness with one great block sitting out in the lagoon sea birds were nesting there 	like icing said ralph on a pink cake 	we shant see round this corner said jack because there isnt one only a slow curveand you can see the rocks get worse 	ralph shaded his eyes and followed the jagged outline of the crags up toward the mountain this part of the beach was nearer the mountain than any other that they had seen 	well try climbing the mountain from here he said i should think this is the easiest way theres less of that jungly stuff and more pink rock come on 	the three boys began to scramble up some unknown force had wrenched and shattered these cubes so that they lay askew often piled diminishingly on each other the most usual feature of the rock was a pink cliff surmounted by a skewed block and that again surmounted and that again till the pinkness became a stack of balanced rock projecting through the looped fantasy of the forest creepers where the pink cliffs rose out of the ground there were often narrow tracks winding upwards they could edge along them deep in the plant world their faces to the rock 	what made this track 	jack paused wiping the sweat from his face ralph stood by him breathless 	men 	jack shook his head 	animals 	ralph peered into the darkness under the trees the forest minutely vibrated 	come on 	the difficulty was not the steep ascent round the shoulders of rock but the occasional plunges through the undergrowth to get to the next path here the roots and stems of creepers were in such tangles that the boys had to thread through them like pliant needles their only guide apart from the brown ground and occasional flashes of light through the foliage was the tendency of slope whether this hole laced as it was with the cables of creeper stood higher than that 	somehow they moved up 	immured in these tangles at perhaps their most difficult moment ralph turned with shining eyes to the others 	wacco 	wizard 	smashing 	the cause of their pleasure was not obvious all three were hot dirty and exhausted ralph was badly scratched the creepers were as thick as their thighs and left little but tunnels for further penetration ralph shouted experimentally and they listened to the muted echoes 	this is real exploring said jack i bet nobodys been here before 	we ought to draw a map said ralph only we havent any paper 	we could make scratches on bark said simon and rub black stuff in 	again came the solemn communion of shining eyes in the gloom 	wacco 	wizard 	there was no place for standing on ones head this time ralph expressed the intensity of his emotion by pretending to knock simon down and soon they were a happy heaving pile in the underdusk 	when they had fallen apart ralph spoke first 	got to get on 	the pink granite of the next cliff was further back from the creepers and trees so that they could trot up the path this again led into more open forest so that they had a glimpse of the spread sea with openness came the sun it dried the sweat that had soaked their clothes in the dark damp heat at last the way to the top looked like a scramble over pink rock with no more plunging through darkness the boys chose their way through defiles and over heaps of sharp stone 	look look 	high over this end of the island the shattered rocks lifted up their stacks and chimneys this one against which jack leaned moved with a grating sound when they pushed 	come on 	but not come on to the top the assault on the summit must wait while the three boys accepted this challenge the rock was as large as a small motor car 	heave 	sway back and forth catch the rhythm 	heave 	increase the swing of the pendulum increase increase come up and bear against that point of furthest balance increaseincrease  	heave 	the great rock loitered poised on one toe decided not to return moved through the air fell struck turned over leapt droning through the air and smashed a deep hole in the canopy of the forest echoes and birds flew white and pink dust floated the forest further down shook as with the passage of an enraged monster and then the island was still 	wacco 	like a bomb 	wheeaaoo 	not for five minutes could they drag themselves away from this triumph but they left at last 	the way to the top was easy after that as they reached the last stretch ralph stopped 	golly 	they were on the lip of a circular hollow in the side of the mountain this was filled with a blue flower a rock plant of some sort and the overflow hung down the vent and spilled lavishly among the canopy of the forest the air was thick with butterflies lifting fluttering settling 	beyond the hollow was the square top of the mountain and soon they were standing on it 	they had guessed before that this was an island clambering among the pink rocks with the sea on either side and the crystal heights of air they had known by some instinct that the sea lay on every side but there seemed something more fitting in leaving the last word till they stood on the top and could see a circular horizon of water 	ralph turned to the others 	this belongs to us 	it was roughly boatshaped humped near this end with behind them the jumbled descent to the shore on either side rocks cliffs treetops and a steep slope forward there the length of the boat a tamer descent treeclad with hints of pink and then the jungly flat of the island dense green but drawn at the end to a pink tail there where the island petered out in water was another island a rock almost detached standing like a fort facing them across the green with one bold pink bastion 	the boys surveyed all this then looked out to sea they were high up and the afternoon had advanced the view was not robbed of sharpness by mirage 	thats a reef a coral reef ive seen pictures like that 	the reef enclosed more than one side of the island lying perhaps a mile out and parallel to what they now thought of as their beach the coral was scribbled in the sea as though a giant had bent down to reproduce the shape of the island in a flowing chalk line but tired before he had finished inside was peacock water rocks and weeds showing as in an aquarium outside was the dark blue of the sea the tide was running so that long streaks of foam tailed away from the reef and for a moment they felt that the boat was moving steadily astern 	jack pointed down 	thats where we landed 	beyond falls and cliffs there was a gash visible in the trees there were the splintered trunks and then the drag leaving only a fringe of palm between the scar and the sea there too jutting into the lagoon was the platform with insectlike figures moving near it 	ralph sketched a twining line from the bald spot on which they stood down a slope a gully through flowers round and down to the rock where the scar started 	thats the quickest way back 	eyes shining mouths open triumphant they savored the right of domination they were lifted up were friends 	theres no village smoke and no boats said ralph wisely well make sure later but i think its uninhabited 	well get food cried jack hunt catch things until they fetch us 	simon looked at them both saying nothing but nodding till his black hair flopped backwards and forwards his face was glowing 	ralph looked down the other way where there was no reef 	steeper said jack 	ralph made a cupping gesture 	that bit of forest down there    the mountain holds it up 	every point of the mountain held up treesflowers and trees now the forest stirred roared flailed the nearer acres of rock flowers fluttered and for half a minute the breeze blew cool on their faces 	ralph spread his arms 	all ours 	they laughed and tumbled and shouted on the mountain 	im hungry 	when simon mentioned his hunger the others became aware of theirs 	come on said ralph weve found out what we wanted to know 	they scrambled down a rock slope dropped among flowers and made their way under the trees here they paused and examined the bushes round them curiously 	simon spoke first 	like candles candle bushes candle buds 	the bushes were dark evergreen and aromatic and the many buds were waxen green and folded up against the light jack slashed at one with his knife and the scent spilled over them 	candle buds 	you couldnt light them said ralph they just look like candles 	green candles said jack contemptuously we cant eat them come on 	they were in the beginnings of the thick forest plonking with weary feet on a track when they heard the noisessqueakingsand the hard strike of hoofs on a path as they pushed forward the squeaking increased till it became a frenzy they found a piglet caught in a curtain of creepers throwing itself at the elastic traces in all the madness of extreme terror its voice was thin needlesharp and insistent the three boys rushed forward and jack drew his knife again with a flourish he raised his arm in the air there came a pause a hiatus the pig continued to scream and the creepers to jerk and the blade continued to flash at the end of a bony arm the pause was only long enough for them to understand what an enormity the downward stroke would be then the piglet tore loose from the creepers and scurried into the undergrowth they were left looking at each other and the place of terror jacks face was white under the freckles he noticed that he still held the knife aloft and brought his arm down replacing the blade in the sheath then they all three laughed ashamedly and began to climb back to the track 	i was choosing a place said jack i was just waiting for a moment to decide where to stab him 	you should stick a pig said ralph fiercely they always talk about sticking a pig 	you cut a pigs throat to let the blood out said jack otherwise you cant eat the meat 	why didnt you 	they knew very well why he hadnt because of the enormity of the knife descending and cutting into living flesh because of the unbearable blood 	i was going to said jack he was ahead of them and they could not see his face i was choosing a place next time 	he snatched his knife out of the sheath and slammed it into a tree trunk next time there would be no mercy he looked round fiercely daring them to contradict then they broke out into the sunlight and for a while they were busy finding and devouring food as they moved down the scar toward the platform and the meeting   chapter two  fire on the mountain  	by the time ralph finished blowing the conch the platform was crowded there were differences between this meeting and the one held in the morning the afternoon sun slanted in from the other side of the platform and most of the children feeling too late the smart of sunburn had put their clothes on the choir less of a group had discarded their cloaks 	ralph sat on a fallen trunk his left side to the sun on his right were most of the choir on his left the larger boys who had not known each other before the evacuation before him small children squatted in the grass 	silence now ralph lifted the cream and pink shell to his knees and a sudden breeze scattered light over the platform he was uncertain whether to stand up or remain sitting he looked sideways to his left toward the bathing pool piggy was sitting near but giving no help 	ralph cleared his throat 	well then 	all at once he found he could talk fluently and explain what he had to say he passed a hand through his fair hair and spoke 	were on an island weve been on the mountain top and seen water all round we saw no houses no smoke no footprints no boats no people were on an uninhabited island with no other people on it 	jack broke in 	all the same you need an armyfor hunting hunting pigs 	yes there are pigs on the island 	all three of them tried to convey the sense of the pink live thing struggling in the creepers 	we saw  	squealing 	it broke away 	before i could kill itbutnext time 	jack slammed his knife into a trunk and looked round challengingly 	the meeting settled down again 	so you see said ralph we need hunters to get us meat and another thing 	he lifted the shell on his knees and looked round the sunslashed faces 	there arent any grownups we shall have to look after ourselves 	the meeting hummed and was silent 	and another thing we cant have everybody talking at once well have to have hands up like at school 	he held the conch before his face and glanced round the mouth 	then ill give him the conch 	conch 	thats what this shells called ill give the conch to the next person to speak he can hold it when hes speaking 	but 	look 	and he wont be interrupted except by me 	jack was on his feet 	well have rules he cried excitedly lots of rules then when anyone breaks em 	wheeoh 	wacco 	bong 	doink 	ralph felt the conch lifted from his lap then piggy was standing cradling the great cream shell and the shouting died down jack left on his feet looked uncertainly at ralph who smiled and patted the log jack sat down piggy took off his glasses and blinked at the assembly while he wiped them on his shirt 	youre hindering ralph youre not letting him get to the most important thing 	he paused effectively 	who knows were here eh 	they knew at the airport 	the man with a trumpetthing 	my dad 	piggy put on his glasses 	nobody knows where we are said piggy he was paler than before and breathless perhaps they knew where we was going to and perhaps not but they dont know where we are cos we never got there he gaped at them for a moment then swayed and sat down ralph took the conch from his hands 	thats what i was going to say he went on when you all all    he gazed at their intent faces the plane was shot down in flames nobody knows where we are we may be here a long time 	the silence was so complete that they could hear the unevenness of piggys breathing the sun slanted in and lay golden over half the platform the breezes that on the lagoon had chased their tails like kittens were finding their way across the platform and into the forest ralph pushed back the tangle of fair hair that hung on his forehead 	so we may be here a long time 	nobody said anything he grinned suddenly 	but this is a good island wejack simon and me we climbed the mountain its wizard theres food and drink and 	rocks 	blue flowers 	piggy partly recovered pointed to the conch in ralphs hands and jack and simon fell silent ralph went on 	while were waiting we can have a good time on this island 	he gesticulated widely 	its like in a book 	at once there was a clamor 	treasure island 	swallows and amazons 	coral island 	ralph waved the conch 	this is our island its a good island until the grownups come to fetch us well have fun 	jack held out his hand for the conch 	theres pigs he said theres food and bathing water in that little stream along thereand everything didnt anyone find anything else 	he handed the conch back to ralph and sat down apparently no one had found anything 	the older boys first noticed the child when he resisted there was a group of little boys urging him forward and he did not want to go he was a shrimp of a boy about six years old and one side of his face was blotted out by a mulberrycolored birthmark he stood now warped out of the perpendicular by the fierce light of publicity and he bored into the coarse grass with one toe he was muttering and about to cry 	the other little boys whispering but serious pushed him toward ralph 	all right said ralph come on then 	the small boy looked round in panic 	speak up 	the small boy held out his hands for the conch and the assembly shouted with laughter at once he snatched back his hands and started to cry 	let him have the conch shouted piggy let him have it 	at last ralph induced him to hold the shell but by then the blow of laughter had taken away the childs voice piggy knelt by him one hand on the great shell listening and interpreting to the assembly 	he wants to know what youre going to do about the snakething 	ralph laughed and the other boys laughed with him the small boy twisted further into himself 	tell us about the snakething  	now he says it was a beastie 	beastie 	a snakething ever so big he saw it 	where 	in the woods 	either the wandering breezes or perhaps the decline of the sun allowed a little coolness to lie under the trees the boys felt it and stirred restlessly 	you couldnt have a beastie a snakething on an island this size ralph explained kindly you only get them in big countries like africa or india 	murmur and the grave nodding of heads 	he says the beastie came in the dark 	then he couldnt see it 	laughter and cheers 	did you hear that says he saw the thing in the dark 	he still says he saw the beastie it came and went away again an came back and wanted to eat him 	he was dreaming 	laughing ralph looked for confirmation round the ring of faces the older boys agreed but here and there among the little ones was the doubt that required more than rational assurance 	he must have had a nightmare stumbling about among all those creepers 	more grave nodding they knew about nightmares he says he saw the beastie the snakething and will it come back tonight 	but there isnt a beastie 	he says in the morning it turned into them things like ropes in the trees and hung in the branches he says will it come back tonight 	but there isnt a beastie 	there was no laughter at all now and more grave watching ralph pushed both hands through his hair and looked at the little boy in mixed amusement and exasperation 	jack seized the conch 	ralphs right of course there isnt a snakething but if there was a snake wed hunt it and kill it were going to hunt pigs to get meat for everybody and well look for the snake too 	but there isnt a snake 	well make sure when we go hunting 	ralph was annoyed and for the moment defeated he felt himself facing something ungraspable the eyes that looked so intently at him were without humor 	but there isnt a beast 	something he had not known was there rose in him and compelled him to make the point loudly and again 	but i tell you there isnt a beast 	the assembly was silent 	ralph lifted the conch again and his good humor came back as he thought of what he had to say next 	now we come to the most important thing ive been thinking i was thinking while we were climbing the mountain he flashed a conspiratorial grin at the other two and on the beach just now this is what i thought we want to have fun and we want to be rescued 	the passionate noise of agreement from the assembly hit him like a wave and he lost his thread he thought again 	we want to be rescued and of course we shall be rescued 	voices babbled the simple statement unbacked by any proof but the weight of ralphs new authority brought light and happiness he had to wave the conch before he could make them hear him 	my fathers in the navy he said there arent any unknown islands left he says the queen has a big room full of maps and all the islands in the world are drawn there so the queens got a picture of this island 	again came the sounds of cheerfulness and better heart 	and sooner or later a ship will put in here it might even be daddys ship so you see sooner or later we shall be rescued 	he paused with the point made the assembly was lifted toward safety by his words they liked and now respected him spontaneously they began to clap and presently the platform was loud with applause ralph flushed looking sideways at piggys open admiration and then the other way at jack who was smirking and showing that he too knew how to clap 	ralph waved the conch 	shut up wait listen 	he went on in the silence borne on his triumph 	theres another thing we can help them to find us if a ship comes near the island they may not notice us so we must make smoke on top of the mountain we must make a fire 	a fire make a fire 	at once half the boys were on their feet jack clamored among them the conch forgotten 	come on follow me 	the space under the palm trees was full of noise and movement ralph was on his feet too shouting for quiet but no one heard him all at once the crowd swayed toward the island and was gonefollowing jack even the tiny children went and did their best among the leaves and broken branches ralph was left holding the conch with no one but piggy 	piggys breathing was quite restored 	like kids he said scornfully acting like a crowd of kids 	ralph looked at him doubtfully and laid the conch on the tree trunk 	i bet its gone teatime said piggy what do they think theyre going to do on that mountain 	he caressed the shell respectfully then stopped and looked up 	ralph hey where you going 	ralph was already clambering over the first smashed swathes of the scar a long way ahead of him was crashing and laughter 	piggy watched him in disgust 	like a crowd of kids 	he sighed bent and laced up his shoes the noise of the errant assembly faded up the mountain then with the martyred expression of a parent who has to keep up with the senseless ebullience of the children he picked up the conch turned toward the forest and began to pick his way over the tumbled scar  	below the other side of the mountain top was a platform of forest once more ralph found himself making the cupping gesture 	down there we could get as much wood as we want  	jack nodded and pulled at his underlip starting perhaps a hundred feet below them on the steeper side of the mountain the patch might have been designed expressly for fuel trees forced by the damp heat found too little soil for full growth fell early and decayed creepers cradled them and new saplings searched a way up 	jack turned to the choir who stood ready their black caps of maintenance were slid over one ear like berets 	well build a pile come on 	they found the likeliest path down and began tugging at the dead wood and the small boys who had reached the top came sliding too till everyone but piggy was busy most of the wood was so rotten that when they pulled it broke up into a shower of fragments and woodlice and decay but some trunks came out in one piece the twins sam n eric were the first to get a likely log but they could do nothing till ralph jack simon roger and maurice found room for a handhold then they inched the grotesque dead thing up the rock and toppled it over on top each party of boys added a quota less or more and the pile grew at the return ralph found himself alone on a limb with jack and they grinned at each other sharing this burden once more amid the breeze the shouting the slanting sunlight on the high mountain was shed that glamour that strange invisible light of friendship adventure and content 	almost too heavy 	jack grinned back 	not for the two of us 	together joined in an effort by the burden they staggered up the last steep of the mountain together they chanted one two three and crashed the log on to the great pile then they stepped back laughing with triumphant pleasure so that immediately ralph had to stand on his head below them boys were still laboring though some of the small ones had lost interest and were searching this new forest for fruit now the twins with unsuspected intelligence came up the mountain with armfuls of dried leaves and dumped them against the pile one by one as they sensed that the pile was complete the boys stopped going back for more and stood with the pink shattered top of the mountain around them breath came evenly by now and sweat dried 	ralph and jack looked at each other while society paused about them the shameful knowledge grew in them and they did not know how to begin confession 	ralph spoke first crimson in the face 	will you 	he cleared his throat and went on 	will you light the fire 	now the absurd situation was open jack blushed too he began to mutter vaguely 	you rub two sticks you rub 	he glanced at ralph who blurted out the last confession of incompetence  	has anyone got any matches 	you make a bow and spin the arrow said roger he rubbed his hands in mime psss psss 	a little air was moving over the mountain piggy came with it in shorts and shirt laboring cautiously out of the forest with the evening sunlight gleaming from his glasses he held the conch under his arm 	ralph shouted at him 	piggy have you got any matches 	the other boys took up the cry till the mountain rang piggy shook his head and came to the pile 	my youve made a big heap havent you 	jack pointed suddenly 	his specsuse them as burning glasses 	piggy was surrounded before he could back away 	herelet me go his voice rose to a shriek of terror as jack snatched the glasses off his face mind out give em back i can hardly see youll break the conch 	ralph elbowed him to ne side and knelt by the pile  	stand out of the light 	there was pushing and pulling and officious cries ralph moved the lenses back and forth this way and that till a glossy white image of the declining sun lay on a piece of rotten wood almost at once a thin trickle of smoke rose up and made him cough jack knelt too and blew gently so that the smoke drifted away thickening and a tiny flame appeared the flame nearly invisible at first in that bright sunlight enveloped a small twig grew was enriched with color and reached up to a branch which exploded with a sharp crack the flame flapped higher and the boys broke into a cheer 	my specs howled piggy give me my specs 	ralph stood away from the pile and put the glasses into piggys groping hands his voice subsided to a mutter 	jus blurs thats all hardly see my hand 	the boys were dancing the pile was so rotten and now so tinderdry that whole limbs yielded passionately to the yellow flames that poured upwards and shook a great beard of flame twenty feet in the air for yards round the fire the heat was like a blow and the breeze was a river of sparks trunks crumbled to white dust 	ralph shouted 	more wood all of you get more wood 	life became a race with the fire and the boys scattered through the upper forest to keep a clean flag of flame flying on the mountain was the immediate end and no one looked further even the smallest boys unless fruit claimed them brought little pieces of wood and threw them in the air moved a little faster and became a light wind so that leeward and windward side were clearly differentiated on one side the air was cool but on the other the fire thrust out a savage arm of heat that crinkled hair on the instant boys who felt the evening wind on their damp faces paused to enjoy the freshness of it and then found they were exhausted they flung themselves down in the shadows that lay among the shattered rocks the beard of flame diminished quickly then the pile fell inwards with a soft cindery sound and sent a great tree of sparks upwards that leaned away and drifted downwind the boys lay panting like dogs 	ralph raised his head off his forearms 	that was no good 	roger spat efficiently into the hot dust 	what dyou mean 	there wasnt any smoke only flame 	piggy had settled himself in a space between two rocks and sat with the conch on his knees 	we havent made a fire he said whats any use we couldnt keep a fire like that going not if we tried 	a fat lot you tried said jack contemptuously you just sat 	we used his specs said simon smearing a black cheek with his forearm he helped that way 	i got the conch said piggy indignantly you let me speak  	the conch doesnt count on top of the mountain said jack so you shut up 	i got the conch in my hand 	put on green branches said maurice thats the best way to make smoke  	i got the conch 	jack turned fiercely 	you shut up 	piggy wilted ralph took the conch from him and looked round the circle of boys 	weve got to have special people for looking after the fire any day there may be a ship out therehe waved his arm at the taut wire of the horizonand if we have a signal going theyll come and take us off and another thing we ought to have more rules where the conch is thats a meeting the same up here as down there 	they assented piggy opened his mouth to speak caught jacks eye and shut it again jack held out his hands for the conch and stood up holding the delicate thing carefully in his sooty hands 	i agree with ralph weve got to have rules and obey them after all were not savages were english and the english are best at everything so weve got to do the right things 	he turned to ralph 	ralph ill split up the choirmy hunters that isinto groups and well be responsible for keeping the fire going 	this generosity brought a spatter of applause from the boys so that jack grinned at them then waved the conch for silence 	well let the fire burn out now who would see smoke at nighttime anyway and we can start the fire again whenever we like altos you can keep the fire going this week and trebles the next 	the assembly assented gravely 	and well be responsible for keeping a lookout too if we see a ship out therethey followed the direction of his bony arm with their eyeswell put green branches on then therell be more smoke 	they gazed intently at the dense blue of the horizon as if a little silhouette might appear there at any moment 	the sun in the west was a drop of burning gold that slid nearer and nearer the sill of the world all at once they were aware of the evening as the end of light and warmth 	roger took the conch and looked round at them gloomily 	ive been watching the sea there hasnt been the trace of a ship perhaps well never be rescued 	a murmur rose and swept away ralph took back the conch 	i said before well be rescued sometime weve just got to wait thats all 	daring indignant piggy took the conch 	thats what i said i said about our meetings and things and then you said shut up 	his voice lifted into the whine of virtuous recrimination they stirred and began to shout him down 	you said you wanted a small fire and you been and built a pile like a hayrick if i say anything cried piggy with bitter realism you say shut up but if jack or maurice or simon 	he paused in the tumult standing looking beyond them and down the unfriendly side of the mountain to the great patch where they had found dead wood then he laughed so strangely that they were hushed looking at the flash of his spectacles in astonishment they followed his gaze to find the sour joke 	you got your small fire all right 	smoke was rising here and there among the creepers that festooned the dead or dying trees as they watched a flash of fire appeared at the root of one wisp and then the smoke thickened small flames stirred at the trunk of a tree and crawled away through leaves and brushwood dividing and increasing one patch touched a tree trunk and scrambled up like a bright squirrel the smoke increased sifted rolled outwards the squirrel leapt on the wings of the wind and clung to another standing tree eating downwards beneath the dark canopy of leaves and smoke the fire laid hold on the forest and began to gnaw acres of black and yellow smoke rolled steadily toward the sea at the sight of the flames and the irresistible course of the fire the boys broke into shrill excited cheering the flames as though they were a kind of wild life crept as a jaguar creeps on its belly toward a line of birchlike saplings that fledged an outcrop of the pink rock they flapped at the first of the trees and the branches grew a brief foliage of fire the heart of flame leapt nimbly across the gap between the trees and then went swinging and flaring along the whole row of them beneath the capering boys a quarter of a mile square of forest was savage with smoke and flame the separate noises of the fire merged into a drumroll that seemed to shake the mountain 	you got your small fire all right 	startled ralph realized that the boys were falling still and silent feeling the beginnings of awe at the power set free below them the knowledge and the awe made him savage 	oh shut up 	i got the conch said piggy in a hurt voice i got a right to speak 	they looked at him with eyes that lacked interest in what they saw and cocked ears at the drumroll of the fire piggy glanced nervously into hell and cradled the conch 	we got to let that burn out now and that was our firewood 	he licked his lips 	there aint nothing we can do we ought to be more careful im scared 	jack dragged his eyes away from the fire 	youre always scared yahfatty 	i got the conch said piggy bleakly he turned to ralph i got the conch aint i ralph 	unwillingly ralph turned away from the splendid awful sight 	whats that 	the conch i got a right to speak 	the twins giggled together 	we wanted smoke	 	now look 	a pall stretched for miles away from the island all the boys except piggy started to giggle presently they were shrieking with laughter 	piggy lost his temper 	i got the conch just you listen the first thing we ought to have made was shelters down there by the beach it wasnt half cold down there in the night but the first time ralph says fire you goes howling and screaming up this here mountain like a pack of kids 	by now they were listening to the tirade 	how can you expect to be rescued if you dont put first things first and act proper 	he took off his glasses and made as if to put down the conch but the sudden motion toward it of most of the older boys changed his mind he tucked the shell under his arm and crouched back on a rock 	then when you get here you build a bonfire that isnt no use now you been and set the whole island on fire wont we look funny if the whole island burns up cooked fruit thats what well have to eat and roast pork and thats nothing to laugh at you said ralph was chief and you dont give him time to think then when he says something you rush off like like 	he paused for breath and the fire growled at them 	and thats not all them kids the little uns who took any notice of em who knows how many we got 	ralph took a sudden step forward 	i told you to i told you to get a list of names 	how could i cried piggy indignantly all by myself they waited for two minutes then they fell in the sea they went into the forest they just scattered everywhere how was i to know which was which 	ralph licked pale lips 	then you dont know how many of us there ought to be 	how could i with them little uns running round like insects then when you three came back as soon as you said make a fire they all ran away and i never had a chance 	thats enough said ralph sharply and snatched back the conch if you didnt you didnt 	then you come up here an pinch my specs 	jack turned on him 	you shut up 	and them little uns was wandering about down there where the fire is how dyou know they arent still there 	piggy stood up and pointed to the smoke and flames a murmur rose among the boys and died away something strange was happening to piggy for he was gasping for breath 	that little un gasped piggyhim with the mark on his face i dont see him where is he now 	the crowd was as silent as death 	him that talked about the snakes he was down there 	a tree exploded in the fire like a bomb tall swathes of creepers rose for a moment into view agonized and went down again the little boys screamed at them 	snakes snakes look at the snakes 	in the west and unheeded the sun lay only an inch or two above the sea their faces were lit redly from beneath piggy fell against a rock and clutched it with both hands 	that little un that had a mark on his facewhere ishe now i tell you i dont see him 	the boys looked at each other fearfully unbelieving 	where is he now 	ralph muttered the reply as if in shame perhaps he went back to the the beneath them on the unfriendly side of the mountain the drumroll continued   chapter three  huts on the beach  	jack was bent double he was down like a sprinter his nose only a few inches from the humid earth the tree trunks and the creepers that festooned them lost themlves in a green dusk thirty feet above him and all about was the undergrowth there was only the faintest indication of a trail here a cracked twig and what might be the impression of one side of a hoof he lowered his chin and stared at the traces as though he would force them to speak to him then doglike uncomfortably on all fours yet unheeding his discomfort he stole forward five yards and stopped here was loop of creeper with a tendril pendant from a node the tendril was polished on the underside pigs passing through the loop brushed it with their bristly hide 	jack crouched with his face a few inches away from this clue then stared forward into the semidarkness of the undergrowth his sandy hair considerably longer than it had been when they dropped in was lighter now and his bare back was a mass of dark freckles and peeling sunburn a sharpened stick about five feet long trailed from his right hand and except for a pair of tattered shorts held up by his knifebelt he was naked he closed his eyes raised his head and breathed in gently with flared nostrils assessing the current of warm air for information the forest and he were very still 	at length he let out his breath in a long sigh and opened his eyes they were bright blue eyes that in this frustration seemed bolting and nearly mad he passed his tongue across dry lips and scanned the uncommunicative forest then again he stole forward and cast this way and that over the ground 	the silence of the forest was more oppressive than the heat and at this hour of the day there was not even the whine of insects only when jack himself roused a gaudy bird from a primitive nest of sticks was the silence shattered and echoes set ringing by a harsh cry that seemed to come out of the abyss of ages jack himself shrank at this cry with a hiss of indrawn breath and for a minute became less a hunter than a furtive thing apelike among the tangle of trees then the trail the frustration claimed him again and he searched the ground avidly by the trunk of a vast tree that grew pale flowers on its grey bark he checked closed his eyes and once more drew in the warm air and this time his breath came short there was even a passing pallor in his face and then the surge of blood again he passed like a shadow under the darkness of the tree and crouched looking down at the trodden ground at his feet 	the droppings were warm they lay piled among turned earth they were olive green smooth and they steamed a little jack lifted his head and stared at the inscrutable masses of creeper that lay across the trail then he raised his spear and sneaked forward beyond the creeper the trail joined a pigrun that was wide enough and trodden enough to be a path the ground was hardened by an accustomed tread and as jack rose to his full height he heard something moving on it he swung back his right arm and hurled the spear with all his strength from the pigrun came the quick hard patter of hoofs a castanet sound seductive maddeningthe promise of meat he rushed out of the undergrowth and snatched up his spear the pattering of pigs trotters died away in the distance 	jack stood there streaming with sweat streaked with brown earth stained by all the vicissitudes of a days hunting swearing he turned off the trail and pushed his way through until the forest opened a little and instead of bald trunks supporting a dark roof there were light grey trunks and crowns of feathery palm beyond these was the glitter of the sea and he could hear voices ralph was standing by a contraption of palm trunks and leaves a rude shelter that faced the lagoon and seemed very near to falling down he did not notice when jack spoke 	got any water 	ralph looked up frowning from the complication of leaves he did not notice jack even when he saw him 	i said have you got any water im thirsty ralph withdrew his attention from the shelter and realized jack with a start 	oh hullo water there by the tree ought to be some left 	jack took up a coconut shell that brimmed with fresh water from among a group that was arranged in the shade and drank the water splashed over his chin and neck and chest he breathed noisily when he had finished 	needed that 	simon spoke from inside the shelter 	up a bit 	ralph turned to the shelter and lifted a branch with a whole tiling of leaves 	the leaves came apart and fluttered down simons contrite face appeared in the hole 	sorry 	ralph surveyed the wreck with distaste 	never get it done 	he flung himself down at jacks feet simon remained looking out of the hole in the shelter once down ralph explained 	been working for days now and look 	two shelters were in position but shaky this one was a ruin 	and they keep running off you remember the meeting how everyone was going to work hard until the shelters were finished 	except me and my hunters	 	except the hunters well the littluns are 	he gesticulated sought for a word 	theyre hopeless the older ones arent much better dyou see all day ive been working with simon no one else theyre off bathing or eating or playing 	simon poked his head out carefully 	youre chief you tell em off 	ralph lay flat and looked up at the palm trees and the sky 	meetings dont we love meetings every day twice a day we talk he got on one elbow i bet if i blew the conch this minute theyd come running then wed be you know very solemn and someone would say we ought to build a jet or a submarine or a tv set when the meeting was over theyd work for five minutes then wander off or go hunting 	jack flushed 	we want meat 	well we havent got any yet and we want shelters besides the rest of your hunters came back hours ago theyve been swimming 	i went on said jack i let them go i had to go on i 	he tried to convey the compulsion to track down and kill that was swallowing him up 	i went on i thought by myself 	the madness came into his eyes again 	i thought i mightkill  	but you didnt 	i thought i might 	some hidden passion vibrated in ralphs voice 	but you havent yet 	his invitation might have passed as casual were it not for the undertone 	you wouldnt care to help with the shelters i suppose 	we want meat 	and we dont get it 	now the antagonism was audible 	but i shall next time ive got to get a barb on this spear we wounded a pig and the spear fell out if we could only make barbs 	we need shelters 	suddenly jack shouted in rage 	are you accusing 	all im saying is weve worked dashed hard thats all 	they were both red in the face and found looking at each other difficult ralph rolled on his stomach and began to play with the grass 	if it rains like when we dropped in well need shelters all right and then another thing we need shelters because of the 	he paused for a moment and they both pushed their anger away then he went on with the safe changed subject 	youve noticed havent you 	jack put down his spear and squatted 	noticed what 	well theyre frightened 	he rolled over and peered into jacks fierce dirty face 	i mean the way things are they dream you can hear em have you been awake at night 	jack shook his head 	they talk and scream the littluns even some of the others as if 	as if it wasnt a good island 	astonished at the interruption they looked up at simons serious face 	as if said simon the beastie the beastie or the snakething was real remember 	the two older boys flinched when they heard the shameful syllable snakes were not mentioned now were not mentionable 	as if this wasnt a good island said ralph slowly yes thats right 	jack sat up and stretched out his legs 	theyre batty 	crackers remember when we went exploring they grinned at each other remembering the glamour of the first day ralph went on 	so we need shelters as a sort of 	home 	thats right 	jack drew up his legs clasped his knees and frowned in an effort to attain clarity  	all the samein the forest i mean when youre hunting not when youre getting fruit of course but when youre on your own 	he paused for a moment not sure if ralph would take him seriously 	go on 	if youre hunting sometimes you catch yourself feeling as if he flushed suddenly theres nothing in it of course just a feeling but you can feel as if youre not hunting butbeing hunted as if somethings behind you all the time in the jungle 	they were silent again simon intent ralph incredulous and faintly indignant he sat up rubbing one shoulder with a dirty hand 	well i dont know 	jack leapt to his feet and spoke very quickly 	thats how you can feel in the forest of course theres nothing in it onlyonly 	he took a few rapid steps toward the beach then came back 	only i know how they feel see thats all 	the best thing we can do is get ourselves rescued 	jack had to think for a moment before he could remember what rescue was 	rescue yes of course all the same id like to catch a pig first he snatched up his spear and dashed it into the ground the opaque mad look came into his eyes again ralph looked at him critically through his tangle of fair hair 	so long as your hunters remember the fire 	you and your fire 	the two boys trotted down the beach and turning at the waters edge looked back at the pink mountain the trickle of smoke sketched a chalky line up the solid blue of the sky wavered high up and faded ralph frowned 	i wonder how far off you could see that 	miles  	we dont make enough smoke 	the bottom part of the trickle as though conscious of their gaze thickened to a creamy blur which crept up the feeble column 	theyve put on green branches muttered ralph i wonder he screwed up his eyes and swung round to search the horizon 	got it 	jack shouted so loudly that ralph jumped 	what where is it a ship 	but jack was pointing to the high declivities that led down from the mountain to the flatter part of the island 	of course theyll lie up therethey must when the suns too hot 	ralph gazed bewildered at his rapt face 	they get up high high up and in the shade resting during the heat like cows at home 	i thought you saw a ship 	we could steal up on onepaint our faces so they wouldnt seeperhaps surround them and then 	indignation took away ralphs control 	i was talking about smoke dont you want to be rescued all you can talk about is pig pig pig 	but we want meat 	and i work all day with nothing but simon and you come back and dont even notice the huts 	i was working too 	but you like it shouted ralph you want to hunt while i 	they faced each other on the bright beach astonished at the rub of feeling ralph looked away first pretending interest in a group of littluns on the sand from beyond the platform came the shouting of the hunters in the swimming pool on the end of the platform piggy was lying flat looking down into the brilliant water 	people dont help much 	he wanted to explain how people were never quite what you thought they were 	simon he helps he pointed at the shelters 	all the rest rushed off hes done as much as i have only 	simons always about 	ralph stared back to the shelters with jack by his side 	do a bit for you muttered jack before i have a bathe 	dont bother 	but when they reached the shelters simon was not to be seen ralph put his head in the hole withdrew it and turned to jack 	hes buzzed off 	got fed up said jack and gone for a bathe 	ralph frowned 	hes queer hes funny 	jack nodded as much for the sake of agreeing as anything and by tacit consent they left the shelter and went toward the bathing pool 	and then said jack when ive had a bathe and something to eat ill just trek over to the other side of the mountain and see if i can see any traces coming 	but the suns nearly set 	i might have time 	they walked along two continents of experience and feeling unable to communicate 	if i could only get a pig 	ill come back and go on with the shelter 	they looked at each other baffled in love and hate all the warm salt water of the bathing pool and the shouting and splashing and laughing were only just sufficient to bring them together again  	simon was not in the bathing pool as they had expected 	when the other two had trotted down the beach to look back at the mountain he had followed them for a few yards and then stopped he had stood frowing down at a pile of sand on the beach where somebody had been trying to build a little house or hut then he turned his back on this and walked into the forest with an air of purpose he was a small skinny boy his chin pointed and his eyes so bright they had deceived ralph into thinking him delightfully gay and wicked the coarse mop of black hair was long and swung down almost concealing a low broad forehead he wore the remains of shorts and his feet were bare like jacks always darkish in color simon was burned by the sun to a deep tan that glistened with sweat 	he picked his way up the scar passed the great rock where ralph had climbed on the first morning then turned off to his right among the trees he walked with an accustomed tread through the acres of fruit trees where the least energetic could find an easy if unsatisfying meal flower and fruit grew together on the same tree and everywhere was the scent of ripeness and the booming of a million bees at pasture here the littluns who had run after him caught up with him they talked cried out unintelligibly lugged him toward the trees then amid the roar of bees in the afternoon sunlight simon found for them the fruit they could not reach pulled off the choicest from up in the foliage passed them back down to the endless outstretched hands when he had satisfied them he paused and looked round the littluns watched him inscrutably over double handfuls of ripe fruit 	simon turned away from them and went where the just perceptible path led him soon high jungle closed in tall trunks bore unexpected pale flowers all the way up to the dark canopy where life went on clamorously the air here was dark too and the creepers dropped their ropes like the rigging of foundered ships his feet left prints in the soft soil and the creepers shivered throughout their lengths when he bumped them 	he came at last to a place where more sunshine fell since they had not so far to go for light the creepers had woven a great mat that hung at the side of an open space in the jungle for here a patch of rock came close to the surface and would not allow more than little plants and ferns to grow the whole space was walled with dark aromatic bushes and was a bowl of heat and light a great tree fallen across one corner leaned against the trees that still stood and a rapid climber flaunted red and yellow sprays right to the top 	simon paused he looked over his shoulder as jack had done at the close ways behind him and glanced swiftly round to confirm that he was utterly alone for a moment his movements were almost furtive then he bent down and wormed his way into the center of the mat the creepers and the bushes were so close that he left his sweat on them and they pulled together behind him when he was secure in the middle he was in a little cabin screened off from the open space by a few leaves he squatted down parted the leaves and looked out into the clearing nothing moved but a pair of gaudy butterflies that danced round each other in the hot air holding his breath he cocked a critical ear at the sounds of the island evening was advancing toward the island the sounds of the bright fantastic birds the beesounds even the crying of the gulls that were returning to their roosts among the square rocks were fainter the deep sea breaking miles away on the reef made an undertone less perceptible than the susurration of the blood 	simon dropped the screen of leaves back into place the slope of the bars of honeycolored sunlight decreased they slid up the bushes passed over the green candlelike buds moved up toward the canopy and darkness thickened under the trees with the fading of the light the riotous colors died and the heat and urgency cooled away the candlebuds stirred their green sepals drew back a little and the white tips of the flowers rose delicately to meet the open air 	now the sunlight had lifted clear of the open space and withdrawn from the sky darkness poured out submerging the ways between the trees till they were dim and strange as the bottom of the sea the candlebuds opened their wide white flowers glimmering under the light that pricked down from the first stars their scent spilled out into the air and took possession of the island   chapter four  painted faces and long hair  	the first rhythm that they became used to was the slow swing from dawn to quick dusk they accepted the pleasures of morning the bright sun the whelming sea and sweet air as a time when play was good and life so full that hope was not necessary and therefore forgotten toward noon as the floods of light fell more nearly to the perpendicular the stark colors of the morning were smoothed in pearl and opalescence and the heatas though the impending suns height gave it momentumbecame a blow that they ducked running to the shade and lying there perhaps even sleeping 	strange things happened at midday the glittering sea rose up moved apart in planes of blatant impossibility the coral reef and the few stunted palms that clung to the more elevated parts would float up into the sky would quiver be plucked apart run like raindrops on a wire or be repeated as in an odd succession of mirrors sometimes land loomed where there was no land and flicked out like a bubble as the children watched piggy discounted all this learnedly as a mirage and since no boy could reach even the reef over the stretch of water where the snapping sharks waited they grew accustomed to these mysteries and ignored them just as they ignored the miraculous throbbing stars at midday the illusions merged into the sky and there the sun gazed down like an angry eye then at the end of the afternoon the mirage subsided and the horizon became level and blue and clipped as the sun declined that was another time of comparative coolness but menaced by the coming of the dark when the sun sank darkness dropped on the island like an extinguisher and soon the shelters were full of restlessness under the remote stars 	nevertheless the northern european tradition of work play and food right through the day made it possible for them to adjust themselves wholly to this new rhythm the littlun percival had early crawled into a shelter and stayed there for two days talking singing and crying till they thought him batty and were faintly amused ever since then he had been peaked redeyed and miserable a littiun who played little and cried often 	the smaller boys were known now by the generic title of littluns the decrease in size from ralph down was gradual and though there was a dubious region inhabited by simon and robert and maurice nevertheless no one had any difficulty in recognizing biguns at one end and littluns at the other the undoubted littluns those aged about six led a quite distinct and at the same time intense life of their own they ate most of the day picking fruit where they could reach it and not particular about ripeness and quality they were used now to stomachaches and a sort of chronic diarrhoea they suffered untold terrors in the dark and huddled together for comfort apart from food and sleep they found time for play aimless and trivial in the white sand by the bright water they cried for their mothers much less often than might have been expected they were very brown and filthily dirty they obeyed the summons of the conch partly because ralph blew it and he was big enough to be a link with the adult world of authority and partly because they enjoyed the entertainment of the assemblies but otherwise they seldom bothered with the biguns and their passionately emotional and corporate life was their own 	they had built castles in the sand at the bar of the little river these castles were about one foot high and were decorated with shells withered flowers and interesting stones round the castles was a complex of marks tracks walls railway lines that were of significance only if inspected with the eye at beachlevel the littluns played here if not happily at least with absorbed attention and often as many as three of them would play the same game together 	three were playing here now henry was the biggest of them he was also a distant relative of that other boy whose mulberrymarked face had not been seen since the evening of the great fire but he was not old enough to understand this and if he had been told that the other boy had gone home in an aircraft he would have accepted the statement without fuss or disbelief 	henry was a bit of a leader this afternoon because the other two were percival and johnny the smallest boys on the island percival was mousecolored and had not been very attractive even to his mother johnny was well built with fair hair and a natural belligerence just now he was being obedient because he was interested and the three children kneeling in the sand were at peace 	roger and maurice came out of the forest they were relieved from duty at the fire and had come down for a swim roger led the way straight through the castles kicking them over burying the flowers scattering the chosen stones maurice followed laughing and added to the destruction the three littluns paused in their game and looked up as it happened the particular marks in which they were interested had not been touched so they made no protest only percival began to whimper with an eyeful of sand and maurice hurried away in his other life maurice had received chastisement for filling a younger eye with sand now though there was no parent to let fall a heavy hand maurice still felt the unease of wrongdoing at the back of his mind formed the uncertain outlines of an excuse he muttered something about a swim and broke into a trot  	roger remained watching the littluns he was not noticeably darker than when he had dropped in but the shock of black hair down his nape and low on his forehead seemed to suit his gloomy face and made what had seemed at first an unsociable remoteness into something forbidding percival finished his whimper and went on playing for the tears had washed the sand away johnny watched him with chinablue eyes then began to fling up sand in a shower and presently percival was crying again 	when henry tired of his play and wandered off along the beach roger followed him keeping beneath the palms and drifting casually in the same direction henry walked at a distance from the palms and the shade because he was too young to keep himself out of the sun he went down the beach and busied himself at the waters edge the great pacific tide was coming in and every few seconds the relatively still water of the lagoon heaved forwards an inch there were creatures that lived in this last fling of the sea tiny transparencies that came questing in with the water over the hot dry sand with impalpable organs of sense they examined this new field perhaps food had appeared where at the last incursion there had been none bird droppings insects perhaps any of the strewn detritus of landward life like a myriad of tiny teeth in a saw the transparencies came scavenging over the beach 	this was fascinating to henry he poked about with a bit of stick that itself was waveworn and whitened and a vagrant and tried to control the motions of the scavengers he made little runnels that the tide filled and tried to crowd them with creatures he became absorbed beyond mere happiness as he felt himself exercising control over living things he talked to them urging them ordering them driven back by the tide his footprints became bays in which they were trapped and gave him the illusion of mastery he squatted on his hams at the waters edge bowed with a shock of hair falling over his forehead and past his eyes and the afternoon sun emptied down invisible arrows 	roger waited too at first he had hidden behind a great palm but henrys absorption with the transparencies was so obvious that at last he stood out in full view he looked along the beach percival had gone off crying and johnny was left in triumphant possession of the castles he sat there crooning to himself and throwing sand at an imaginary percival beyond him roger could see the platform and the glints of spray where ralph and simon and piggy and maurice were diving in the pool he listened carefully but could only just hear them 	a sudden breeze shook the fringe of palm trees so that the fronds tossed and fluttered sixty feet above roger several nuts fibrous lumps as big as rugby balls were loosed from their stems they fell about him with a series of hard thumps and he was not touched roger did not consider his escape but looked from the nuts to henry and back again 	the subsoil beneath the palm trees was a raised beach and generations of palms had worked loose in this the stones that had lain on the sands of another shore roger stooped picked up a stone aimed and threw it at henry threw it to miss the stone that token of preposterous time bounced five yards to henrys right and fell in the water roger gathered a handful of stones and began to throw them yet there was a space round henry perhaps six yards in diameter into which he dare not throw here invisible yet strong was the taboo of the old life round the squatting child was the protection of parents and school and policemen and the law rogers arm was conditioned by a civilization that knew nothing of him and was in ruins 	henry was surprised by the plopping sounds in the water he abandoned the noiseless transparencies and pointed at the center of the spreading rings like a setter this side and that the stones fell and henry turned obediently but always too late to see the stones in the air at last he saw one and laughed looking for the friend who was teasing him but roger had whipped behind the palm again was leaning against it breathing quickly his eyelids fluttering then henry lost interest in stones and wandered off 	roger 	jack was standing under a tree about ten yards away when roger opened his eyes and saw him a darker shadow crept beneath the swarthiness of his skin but jack noticed nothing he was eager impatient beckoning so that roger went to him 	there was a small pool at the end of the river dammed back by sand and full of white waterlilies and needlelike reeds here sam and eric were waiting and bill jack concealed from the sun knelt by the pool and opened the two large leaves that he carried one of them contained white clay and the other red by them lay a stick of charcoal brought down from the fire 	jack explained to roger as he worked 	they dont smell me they see me i think something pink under the trees 	he smeared on the clay 	if only id some green 	he turned a halfconcealed face up to roger and answered the incomprehension of his gaze 	for hunting like in the war you knowdazzle paint like things trying to look like something else he twisted in the urgency of telling like moths on a tree trunk 	roger understood and nodded gravely the twins moved toward jack and began to protest timidly about something jack waved them away 	shut up 	he rubbed the charcoal stick between the patches of red and white on his face 	no you two come with me 	he peered at his reflection and disliked it he bent down took up a double handful of lukewarm water and rubbed the mess from his face freckles and sandy eyebrows appeared 	roger smiled unwillingly 	you dont half look a mess 	jack planned his new face he made one cheek and one eyesocket white then he rubbed red over the other half of his face and slashed a black bar of charcoal across from right ear to left jaw he looked in the pool for his reflection but his breathing troubled the mirror 	samneric get me a coconut an empty one 	he knelt holding the shell of water a rounded patch of sunlight fell on his face and a brightness appeared in the depths of the water he looked in astonishment no longer at himself but at an awesome stranger he spilt the water and leapt to his feet laughing excitedly beside the pool his sinewy body held up a mask that drew their eyes and appalled them he began to dance and his laughter became a bloodthirsty snarling he capered toward bill and the mask was a thing on its own behind which jack hid liberated from shame and selfconsciousness the face of red and white and black swung through the air and jigged toward bill bill started up laughing then suddenly he fell silent and blundered away through the bushes 	jack rushed toward the twins 	the rest are making a line come on 	but 	we  	come on ill creep up and stab 	the mask compelled them  	ralph climbed out of the bathing pool and trotted up the beach and sat in the shade beneath the palms his fair hair was plastered over his eyebrows and he pushed it back simon was floating in the water and kicking with his feet and maurice was practicing diving piggy was mooning about aimlessly picking up things and discarding them the rockpools which so fascinated him were covered by the tide so he was without an interest until the tide went back presently seeing ralph under the palms he came and sat by him 	piggy wore the remainders of a pair of shorts his fat body was golden brown and the glasses still flashed when he looked at anything he was the only boy on the island whose hair never seemed to grow the rest were shockheaded but piggys hair still lay in wisps over his head as though baldness were his natural state and this imperfect covering would soon go like the velvet on a young stags antlers 	ive been thinking he said about a clock we could make a sundial we could put a stick in the sand and then 	the effort to express the mathematical processes involved was too great he made a few passes instead 	and an airplane and a tv set said ralph sourly and a steam engine 	piggy shook his head 	you have to have a lot of metal things for that he said and we havent got no metal but we got a stick 	ralph turned and smiled involuntarily piggy was a bore his fat his assmar and his matteroffact ideas were dull but there was always a little pleasure to be got out of pulling his leg even if one did it by accident 	piggy saw the smile and misinterpreted it as friendliness there had grown up tacitly among the biguns the opinion that piggy was an outsider not only by accent which did not matter but by fat and assmar and specs and a certain disinclination for manual labor now finding that something he had said made ralph smile he rejoiced and pressed his advantage  	we got a lot of sticks we could have a sundial each then we should know what the time was 	a fat lot of good that would be 	you said you wanted things done so as we could be rescued 	oh shut up 	he leapt to his feet and trotted back to the pool just as maurice did a rather poor dive ralph was glad of a chance to change the subject he shouted as maurice came to the surface 	belly flop belly flop 	maurice flashed a smile at ralph who slid easily into the water of all the boys he was the most at home there but today irked by the mention of rescue the useless footling mention of rescue even the green depths of water and the shattered golden sun held no balm instead of remaining and playing he swam with steady strokes under simon and crawled out of the other side of the pool to lie there sleek and streaming like a seal piggy always clumsy stood up and came to stand by him so that ralph rolled on his stomach and pretended not to see the mirages had died away and gloomily he ran his eye along the taut blue line of the horizon 	the next moment he was on his feet and shouting 	smoke smoke 	simon tried to sit up in the water and got a mouthful maurice who had been standing ready to dive swayed back on his heels made a bolt for the platform then swerved back to the grass under the palms there he started to pull on his tattered shorts to be ready for anything 	ralph stood one hand holding back his hair the other clenched simon was climbing out of the water piggy was rubbing his glasses on his shorts and squinting at the sea maurice had got both legs through one leg of his shorts of all the boys only ralph was still 	i cant see no smoke said piggy incredulously i cant see no smoke ralphwhere is it 	ralph said nothing now both his hands were clenched over his forehead so that the fair hair was kept out of his eyes he was leaning forward and already the salt was whitening his body 	ralphwheres the ship 	simon stood by looking from ralph to the horizon maurices trousers gave way with a sigh and he abandoned them as a wreck rushed toward the forest and then came back again 	the smoke was a tight little knot on the horizon and was uncoiling slowly beneath the smoke was a dot that might be a funnel ralphs face was pale as he spoke to himself 	theyll see our smoke 	piggy was looking in the right direction now 	it dont look much 	he turned round and peered up at the mountain ralph continued to watch the ship ravenously color was coming back into his face simon stood by him silent 	i know i cant see very much said piggy but have we got any smoke 	ralph moved impatiently still watching the ship 	the smoke on the mountain	 	maurice came running and stared out to sea both simon and piggy were looking up at the mountain piggy screwed up his face but simon cried out as though he had hurt himself 	ralph ralph 	the quality of his speech twisted ralph on the sand 	you tell me said piggy anxiously is there a signal 	ralph looked back at the dispersing smoke in the horizon then up at the mountain  	ralphplease is there a signal 	simon put out his hand timidly to touch ralph but ralph started to run splashing through the shallow end of the bathing pool across the hot white sand and under the palms a moment later he was battling with the complex undergrowth that was already engulfing the scar simon ran after him then maurice piggy shouted 	ralph pleaseralph 	then he too started to run stumbling over maurices discarded shorts before he was across the terrace behind the four boys the smoke moved gently along the horizon and on the beach henry and johnny were throwing sand at percival who was crying quietly again and all three were in complete ignorance of the excitement 	by the time ralph had reached the landward end of the scar he was using precious breath to swear he did desperate violence to his naked body among the rasping creepers so that blood was sliding over him just where the steep ascent of the mountain began he stopped maurice was only a few yards behind him 	piggys specs shouted ralph if the fires all out well need them 	he stopped shouting and swayed on his feet piggy was only just visible bumbling up from the beach ralph looked at the horizon then up to the mountain was it better to fetch piggys glasses or would the ship have gone or if they climbed on supposing the fire was all out and they had to watch piggy crawling nearer and the ship sinking under the horizon balanced on a high peak of need agonized by indecision ralph cried out 	oh god oh god 	simon struggling with the bushes caught his breath his face was twisted ralph blundered on savaging himself as the wisp of smoke moved on 	the fire was dead they saw that straight away saw what they had really known down on the beach when the smoke of home had beckoned the fire was out smokeless and dead the watchers were gone a pile of unused fuel lay ready 	ralph turned to the sea the horizon stretched impersonal once more barren of all but the faintest trace of smoke ralph ran stumbling along the rocks saved himself on the edge of the pink cliff and screamed at the ship 	come back come back 	he ran backwards and forwards along the cliff his face always to the sea and his voice rose insanely 	come back come back 	simon and maurice arrived ralph looked at them with unwinking eyes simon turned away smearing the water from his cheeks ralph reached inside himself for the worst word he knew 	they let the bloody fire go out 	he looked down the unfriendly side of the mountain piggy arrived out of breath and whimpering like a littlun ralph clenched his fist and went very red the intentness of his gaze the bitterness of his voice pointed for him 	there they are 	a procession had appeared far down among the pink stones that lay near the waters edge some of the boys wore black caps but otherwise they were almost naked they lifted sticks in the air together whenever they came to an easy patch they were chanting something to do with the bundle that the errant twins carried so carefully ralph picked out jack easily even at that distance tall redhaired and inevitably leading the procession 	simon looked now from ralph to jack as he had looked from ralph to the horizon and what he saw seemed to make him afraid ralph said nothing more but waited while the procession came nearer the chant was audible but at that distance still wordless behind jack walked the twins carrying a great stake on their shoulders the gutted carcass of a pig swung from the stake swinging heavily as the twins toiled over the uneven ground the pigs head hung down with gaping neck and seemed to search for something on the ground at last the words of the chant floated up to them across the bowl of blackened wood and ashes 	kill the pig cut her throat spill her blood 	yet as the words became audible the procession reached the steepest part of the mountain and in a minute or two the chant had died away piggy sniveled and simon shushed him quickly as though he had spoken too loudly in church 	jack his face smeared with clays reached the top first and hailed ralph excitedly with lifted spear 	look weve killed a pigwe stole up on themwe got in a circle 	voices broke in from the hunters 	we got in a circle  	we crept up 	the pig squealed 	the twins stood with the pig swinging between them dropping black gouts on the rock they seemed to share one wide ecstatic grin jack had too many things to tell ralph at once instead he danced a step or two then remembered his dignity and stood still grinning he noticed blood on his hands and grimaced distastefully looked for something on which to clean them then wiped them on his shorts and laughed 	ralph spoke 	you let the fire go out 	jack checked vaguely irritated by this irrelevance but too happy to let it worry him 	we can light the fire again you should have been with us ralph we had a smashing time the twins got knocked over 	we hit the pig 	i fell on top 	i cut the pigs throat said jack proudly and yet twitched as he said it can i borrow yours ralph to make a nick in the hilt 	the boys chattered and danced the twins continued to grin 	there was lashings of blood said jack laughing and shuddering you should have seen it 	well go hunting every day 	ralph spoke again hoarsely he had not moved 	you let the fire go out 	this repetition made jack uneasy he looked at the twins and then back at ralph 	we had to have them in the hunt he said or there wouldnt have been enough for a ring 	he flushed conscious of a fault 	the fires only been out an hour or two we can light up again 	he noticed ralphs scarred nakedness and the sombre silence of all four of them he sought charitable in his happiness to include them in the thing that had happened his mind was crowded with memories memories of the knowledge that had come to them when they closed in on the struggling pig knowledge that they had outwitted a living thing imposed their will upon it taken away its life like a long satisfying drink 	he spread his arms wide 	you should have seen the blood 	the hunters were more silent now but at this they buzzed again ralph flung back his hair one arm pointed at the empty horizon his voice was loud and savage and struck them into silence 	there was aship 	jack faced at once with too many awful implications ducked away from them he laid a hand on the pig and drew his knife ralph brought his arm down fist clenched and his voice shook 	there was a ship out there you said youd keep the fire going and you let it out he took a step toward jack who turned and faced him 	they might have seen us we might have gone home 	this was too bitter for piggy who forgot his timidity in the agony of his loss he began to cry out shrilly 	you and your blood jack merridew you and your hunting we might have gone home 	ralph pushed piggy to one side 	i was chief and you were going to do what i said you talk but you cant even build hutsthen you go off hunting and let out the fire 	he turned away silent for a moment then his voice came again on a peak of feeling 	there was a ship 	one of the smaller hunters began to wail the dismal truth was filtering through to everybody jack went very red as he hacked and pulled at the pig 	the job was too much we needed everyone 	ralph turned 	you could have had everyone when the shelters were finished but you had to hunt 	we needed meat 	jack stood up as he said this the bloodied knife in his hand the two boys faced each other there was the brilliant world of hunting tactics fierce exhilaration skill and there was the world of longing and baffled commonsense jack transferred the knife to his left hand and smudged blood over his forehead as he pushed down the plastered hair 	piggy began again 	you didnt ought to have let that fire out you said youd keep the smoke going 	this from piggy and the wails of agreement from some of the hunters drove jack to violence the bolting look came into his blue eyes he took a step and able at last to hit someone stuck his fist into piggys stomach piggy sat down with a grunt jack stood over him his voice was vicious with humiliation 	you would would you fatty 	ralph made a step forward and jack smacked piggys head piggys glasses flew off and tinkled on the rocks piggy cried out in terror 	my specs 	he went crouching and feeling over the rocks but simon who got there first found them for him passions beat about simon on the mountaintop with awful wings 	one sides broken 	piggy grabbed and put on the glasses he looked malevolently at jack 	i got to have them specs now i only got one eye jus you wait 	jack made a move toward piggy who scrambled away till a great rock lay between them he thrust his head over the top and glared at jack through his one flashing glass 	now i only got one eye just you wait  	jack mimicked the whine and scramble 	jus you waityah 	piggy and the parody were so funny that the hunters began to laugh jack felt encouraged he went on scrambling and the laughter rose to a gale of hysteria unwillingly ralph felt his lips twitch he was angry with himself for giving way 	he muttered 	that was a dirty trick 	jack broke out of his gyration and stood facing ralph his words came in a shout 	all right all right 	he looked at piggy at the hunters at ralph 	im sorry about the fire i mean there i  	he drew himself up 	i apologize 	the buzz from the hunters was one of admiration at this handsome behavior clearly they were of the opinion that jack had done the decent thing had put himself in the right by his generous apology and ralph obscurely in the wrong they waited for an appropriately decent answer 	yet ralphs throat refused to pass one he resented as an addition to jacks misbehavior this verbal trick the fire was dead the ship was gone could they not see anger instead of decency passed his throat 	that was a dirty trick 	they were silent on the mountaintop while the opaque look appeared in jacks eyes and passed away 	ralphs final word was an ingracious mutter 	all right light the fire 	with some positive action before them a little of the tension died ralph said no more did nothing stood looking down at the ashes round his feet jack was loud and active he gave orders sang whistled threw remarks at the silent ralphremarks that did not need an answer and therefore could not invite a snub and still ralph was silent no one not even jack would ask him to move and in the end they had to build the fire three yards away and in a place not really as convenient 	so ralph asserted his chieftainship and could not have chosen a better way if he had thought for days against this weapon so indefinable and so effective jack was powerless and raged without knowing why by the time the pile was built they were on different sides of a high barrier 	when they had dealt with the fire another crisis arose jack had no means of lighting it then to his surprise ralph went to piggy and took the glasses from him not even ralph knew how a link between him and jack had been snapped and fastened elsewhere 	ill bring em back 	ill come too 	piggy stood behind him islanded in a sea of meaningless color while ralph knelt and focused the glossy spot instantly the fire was alight piggy held out his hands and grabbed the glasses back 	before these fantastically attractive flowers of violet and red and yellow unkindness melted away they became a circle of boys round a camp fire and even piggy and ralph were halfdrawn in soon some of the boys were rushing down the slope for more wood while jack hacked the pig they tried holding the whole carcass on a stake over the fire but the stake burnt more quickly than the pig roasted in the end they skewered bits of meat on branches and held them in the flames and even then almost as much boy was roasted as meat 	ralphs mouth watered he meant to refuse meat but his past diet of fruit and nuts with an odd crab or fish gave him too little resistance he accepted a piece of halfraw meat and gnawed it like a wolf 	piggy spoke also dribbling 	arent i having none 	jack had meant to leave him in doubt as an assertion of power but piggy by advertising his omission made more cruelty necessary 	you didnt hunt 	no more did ralph said piggy wetly nor simon he amplified there isnt more than a haporth of meat in a crab 	ralph stirred uneasily simon sitting between the twins and piggy wiped his mouth and shoved his piece of meat over the rocks to piggy who grabbed it the twins giggled and simon lowered his face in shame 	then jack leapt to his feet slashed off a great hunk of meat and flung it down at simons feet 	eat damn you 	he glared at simon 	take it 	he spun on his heel center of a bewildered circle of boys 	i got you meat 	numberless and inexpressible frustrations combined to make his rage elemental and aweinspiring 	i painted my facei stole up now you eatall of youand i 	slowly the silence on the mountaintop deepened till the click of the fire and the soft hiss of roasting meat could be heard clearly jack looked round for understanding but found only respect ralph stood among the ashes of the signal fire his hands full of meat saying nothing 	then at last maurice broke the silence he changed the subject to the only one that could bring the majority of them together 	where did you find the pig 	roger pointed down the unfriendly side they were thereby the sea 	jack recovering could not bear to have his story told he broke in quickly 	we spread round i crept on hands and knees the spears fell out because they hadnt barbs on the pig ran away and made an awful noise 	it turned back and ran into the circle bleeding 	all the boys were talking at once relieved and excited 	we closed in 	the first blow had paralyzed its hind quarters so then the circle could close in and beat and beat 	i cut the pigs throat 	the twins still sharing their identical grin jumped up and ran round each other then the rest joined in making pigdying noises and shouting 	one for his nob 	give him a fourpenny one 	then maurice pretended to be the pig and ran squealing into the center and the hunters circling still pretended to beat him as they danced they sang 	kill the pig cut her throat bash her in 	ralph watched them envious and resentful not till they flagged and the chant died away did he speak 	im calling an assembly 	one by one they halted and stood watching him 	with the conch im calling a meeting even if we have to go on into the dark down on the platform when i blow it now 	he turned away and walked off down the mountain   chapter five  beast from water  	the tide was coming in and there was only a narrow strip of firm beach between the water and the white stumbling stuff near the palm terrace ralph chose the firm strip as a path because he needed to think and only here could he allow his feet to move without having to watch them suddenly pacing by the water he was overcome with astonishment he found himself understanding the wearisomeness of this life where every path was an improvisation and a considerable part of ones waking life was spent watching ones feet he stopped facing the strip and remembering that first enthusiastic exploration as though it were part of a brighter childhood he smiled jeeringly he turned then and walked back toward the platform with the sun in his face the time had come for the assembly and as he walked into the concealing splendors of the sunlight he went carefully over the points of his speech there must be no mistake about this assembly no chasing imaginary    	he lost himself in a maze of thoughts that were rendered vague by his lack of words to express them frowning he tried again 	this meeting must not be fun but business 	at that he walked faster aware all at once of urgency and the declining sun and a little wind created by his speed that breathed about his face this wind pressed his grey shirt against his chest so that he noticedin this new mood of comprehensionhow the folds were stiff like cardboard and unpleasant noticed too how the frayed edges of his shorts were making an uncomfortable pink area on the front of his thighs with a convulsion of the mind ralph discovered dirt and decay understood how much he disliked perpetually flicking the tangled hair out of his eyes and at last when the sun was gone rolling noisily to rest among dry leaves at that he began to trot 	the beach near the bathing pool was dotted with groups of boys waiting for the assembly they made way for him silently conscious of his grim mood and the fault at the fire 	the place of assembly in which he stood was roughly a triangle but irregular and sketchy like everything they made first there was the log on which he himself sat a dead tree that must have been quite exceptionally big for the platform perhaps one of those legendary storms of the pacific had shifted it here this palm trunk lay parallel to the beach so that when ralph sat he faced the island but to the boys was a darkish figure against the shimmer of the lagoon the two sides of the triangle of which the log was base were less evenly defined on the right was a log polished by restless seats along the top but not so large as the chiefs and not so comfortable on the left were four small logs one of themthe farthestlamentably springy assembly after assembly had broken up in laughter when someone had leaned too far back and the log had whipped and thrown half a dozen boys backwards into the grass yet now he saw no one had had the witnot himself nor jack nor piggyto bring a stone and wedge the thing so they would continue enduring the illbalanced twister because because    again he lost himself in deep waters 	grass was worn away in front of each trunk but grew tall and untrodden in the center of the triangle then at the apex the grass was thick again because no one sat there all round the place of assembly the grey trunks rose straight or leaning and supported the low roof of leaves on two sides was the beach behind the lagoon in front the darkness of the island 	ralph turned to the chiefs seat they had never had an assembly as late before that was why the place looked so different normally the underside of the green roof was lit by a tangle of golden reflections and their faces were lit upside downlike thought ralph when you hold an electric torch in your hands but now the sun was slanting in at one side so that the shadows were where they ought to be 	again he fell into that strange mood of speculation that was so foreign to him if faces were different when lit from above or belowwhat was a face what was anything 	ralph moved impatiently the trouble was if you were a chief you had to think you had to be wise and then the occasion slipped by so that you had to grab at a decision this made you think because thought was a valuable thing that got results    	only decided ralph as he faced the chiefs seat i cant think not like piggy 	once more that evening ralph had to adjust his values piggy could think he could go step by step inside that fat head of his only piggy was no chief but piggy for all his ludicrous body had brains ralph was a specialist in thought now and could recognize thought in another 	the sun in his eyes reminded him how time was passing so he took the conch down from the tree and examined the surface exposure to the air had bleached the yellow and pink to nearwhite and transparency ralph felt a kind of affectionate reverence for the conch even though he had fished the thing out of the lagoon himself he faced the place of assembly and put the conch to his lips 	the others were waiting for this and came straight away those who were aware that a ship had passed the island while the fire was out were subdued by the thought of ralphs anger while those including the littluns who did not know were impressed by the general air of solemnity the place of assembly filled quickly jack simon maurice most of the hunters on ralphs right the rest on the left under the sun piggy came and stood outside the triangle this indicated that he wished to listen but would not speak and piggy intended it as a gesture of disapproval 	the thing is we need an assembly 	no one said anything but the faces turned to ralph were intent he flourished the conch he had learnt as a practical business that fundamental statements like this had to be said at least twice before everyone understood them one had to sit attracting all eyes to the conch and drop words like heavy round stones among the little groups that crouched or squatted he was searching his mind for simple words so that even the littluns would understand what the assembly was about later perhaps practiced debatersjack maurice piggywould use their whole art to twist the meeting but now at the beginning the subject of the debate must be laid out clearly 	we need an assembly not for fun not for laughing and falling off the logthe group of littluns on the twister giggled and looked at each othernot for making jokes or forhe lifted the conch in an effort to find the compelling wordfor cleverness not for these things but to put things straight 	he paused for a moment 	ive been alone by myself i went thinking whats what i know what we need an assembly to put things straight and first of all im speaking 	he paused for a moment and automatically pushed back his hair piggy tiptoed to the triangle his ineffectual protest made and joined the others 	ralph went on 	we have lots of assemblies everybody enjoys speaking and being together we decide things but they dont get done we were going to have water brought from the stream and left in those coconut shells under fresh leaves so it was for a few days now theres no water the shells are dry people drink from the river 	there was a murmur of assent 	not that theres anything wrong with drinking from the river i mean id sooner have water from that place you know the pool where the waterfall isthan out of an old coconut shell only we said wed have the water brought and now not there were only two full shells there this afternoon 	he licked his lips 	then theres huts shelters 	the murmur swelled again and died away 	you mostly sleep in shelters tonight except for samneric up by the fire youll all sleep there who built the shelters 	clamor rose at once everyone had built the shelters ralph had to wave the conch once more 	wait a minute i mean who built all three we all built the first one four of us the second one and me n simon built the last one over there thats why its so tottery no dont laugh that shelter might fall down if the rain comes back well need those shelters then 	he paused and cleared his throat 	theres another thing we chose those rocks right along beyond the bathing pool as a lavatory that was sensible too the tide cleans the place up you littluns know about that 	there were sniggers here and there and swift glances 	now people seem to use anywhere even near the shelters and the platform you littluns when youre getting fruit if youre taken short 	the assembly roared 	i said if youre taken short you keep away from the fruit thats dirty 	laughter rose again 	i said thats dirty 	he plucked at his stiff grey shirt 	thats really dirty if youre taken short you go right along the beach to the rocks see 	piggy held out his hands for the conch but ralph shook his head his speech was planned point by point 	weve all got to use the rocks again this place is getting dirty he paused the assembly sensing a crisis was tensely expectant and then about the fire 	ralph let out his spare breath with a little gasp that was echoed by his audience jack started to chip a piece of wood with his knife and whispered something to robert who looked away 	the fire is the most important thing on the island how can we ever be rescued except by luck if we dont keep a fire going is a fire too much for us to make 	he flung out an arm 	look at us how many are we and yet we cant keep a fire going to make smoke dont you understand cant you see we ought toought to die before we let the fire out 	there was a selfconscious giggling among the hunters ralph turned on them passionately 	you hunters you can laugh but i tell you the smoke is more important than the pig however often you kill one do all of you see he spread his arms wide and turned to the whole triangle 	weve got to make smoke up thereor die 	he paused feeling for his next point 	and another thing 	someone called out 	too many things 	there came a mutter of agreement ralph overrode them 	and another thing we nearly set the whole island on fire and we waste time rolling rocks and making little cooking fires now i say this and make it a rule because im chief we wont have a fire anywhere but on the mountain ever 	there was a row immediately boys stood up and shouted and ralph shouted back 	because if you want a fire to cook fish or crab you can jolly well go up the mountain that way well be certain 	hands were reaching for the conch in the light of the setting sun he held on and leapt on the trunk 	all this i meant to say now ive said it you voted me for chief now you do what i say 	they quieted slowly and at last were seated again ralph dropped down and spoke in his ordinary voice 	so remember the rocks for a lavatory keep the fire going and smoke showing as a signal dont take fire from the mountain take your food up there 	jack stood up scowling in the gloom and held out his hands 	i havent finished yet 	but youve talked and talked 	ive got the conch 	jack sat down grumbling 	then the last thing this is what people can talk about 	he waited till the platform was very still 	things are breaking up i dont understand why we began well we were happy and then 	he moved the conch gently looking beyond them at nothing remembering the beastie the snake the fire the talk of fear 	then people started getting frightened 	a murmur almost a moan rose and passed away jack had stopped whittling ralph went on abruptly 	but thats littluns talk well get that straight so the last part the bit we can all talk about is kind of deciding on the fear 	the hair was creeping into his eyes again 	weve got to talk about this fear and decide theres nothing in it im frightened myself sometimes only thats nonsense like bogies then when weve decided we can start again and be careful about things like the fire a picture of three boys walking along the bright beach flitted through his mind and be happy 	ceremonially ralph laid the conch on the trunk beside him as a sign that the speech was over what sunlight reached them was level 	jack stood up and took the conch 	so this is a meeting to find out whats what ill tell you whats what you littluns started all this with the fear talk beasts where from of course were frightened sometimes but we put up with being frightened only ralph says you scream in the night what does that mean but nightmares anyway you dont hunt or build or helpyoure a lot of crybabies and sissies thats what and as for the fearyoull have to put up with that like the rest of us 	ralph looked at jack openmouthed but jack took no notice 	the thing isfear cant hurt you any more than a dream there arent any beasts to be afraid of on this island he looked along the row of whispering littluns serve you right if something did get you you useless lot of crybabies but there is no animal 	ralph interrupted him testily 	what is all this who said anything about an animal 	you did the other day you said they dream and cry out now they talknot only the littluns but my hunters sometimestalk of a thing a dark thing a beast some sort of animal ive heard you thought not didnt you now listen you dont get big animals on small islands only pigs you only get lions and tigers in big countries like africa and india 	and the zoo 	ive got the conch im not talking about the fear im talking about the beast be frightened if you like but as for the beast 	jack paused cradling the conch and turned to his hunters with their dirty black caps 	am i a hunter or am i not 	they nodded simply he was a hunter all right no one doubted that 	well thenive been all over this island by myself if there were a beast id have seen it be frightened because youre like thatbut there is no beast in the forest 	jack handed back the conch and sat down the whole assembly applauded him with relief then piggy held out his hand 	i dont agree with all jack said but with some course there isnt a beast in the forest how could there be what would a beast eat 	pig 	we eat pig 	piggy 	i got the conch said piggy indignantly ralph they ought to shut up oughtnt they you shut up you littluns what i mean is that i dont agree about this here fear of course there isnt nothing to be afraid of in the forest whyi been there myself youll be talking about ghosts and such things next we know what goes on and if theres something wrong theres someone to put it right 	he took off his glasses and blinked at them the sun had gone as if the light had been turned off 	he proceeded to explain 	if you get a pain in your stomach whether its a little one or a big one 	yours is a big one 	when you done laughing perhaps we can get on with the meeting and if them littluns climb back on the twister again theyll only fall off in a sec so they might as well sit on the ground and listen no you have doctors for everything even the inside of your mind you dont really mean that we got to be frightened all the time of nothing life said piggy expansively is scientific thats what it is in a year or two when the wars over theyll be traveling to mars and back i know there isnt no beastnot with claws and all that i meanbut i know there isnt no fear either 	piggy paused 	unless 	ralph moved restlessly 	unless what 	unless we get frightened of people 	a sound halflaugh halfjeer rose among the seated boys piggy ducked his head and went on hastily 	so lets hear from that littlun who talked about a beast and perhaps we can show him how silly he is 	the littluns began to jabber among themselves then one stood forward 	whats your name 	phil 	for a littlun he was selfconfident holding out his hands cradling the conch as ralph did looking round at them to collect their attention before he spoke 	last night i had a dream a horrid dream fighting with things i was outside the shelter by myself fighting with things those twisty things in the trees 	he paused and the other littluns laughed in horrified sympathy 	then i was frightened and i woke up and i was outside the shelter by myself in the dark and the twisty things had gone away 	the vivid horror of this so possible and so nakedly terrifying held them all silent the childs voice went piping on from behind the white conch 	and i was frightened and started to call out for ralph and then i saw something moving among the trees something big and horrid 	he paused halffrightened by the recollection yet proud of the sensation he was creating 	that was a nightmare said ralph he was walking in his sleep 	the assembly murmured in subdued agreement 	the littlun shook his head stubbornly 	i was asleep when the twisty things were fighting and when they went away i was awake and i saw something big and horrid moving in the trees 	ralph held out his hands for the conch and the littlun sat down 	you were asleep there wasnt anyone there how could anyone be wandering about in the forest at night was anyone did anyone go out 	there was a long pause while the assembly grinned at the thought of anyone going out in the darkness then simon stood up and ralph looked at him in astonishment 	you what were you mucking about in the dark for 	simon grabbed the conch convulsively 	i wantedto go to a placea place i know  	what place 	just a place i know a place in the jungle he hesitated 	jack settled the question for them with that contempt in his voice that could sound so funny and so final 	he was taken short 	with a feeling of humiliation on simons behalf ralph took back the conch looking simon sternly in the face as he did so 	well dont do it again understand not at night theres enough silly talk about beasts without the littluns seeing you gliding about like a 	the derisive laughter that rose had fear in it and condemnation simon opened his mouth to speak but ralph had the conch so he backed to his seat 	when the assembly was silent ralph turned to piggy 	well piggy 	there was another one him 	the littluns pushed percival forward then left him by himself he stood kneedeep in the central grass looking at his hidden feet trying to pretend he was in a tent ralph remembered another small boy who had stood like this and he flinched away from the memory he had pushed the thought down and out of sight where only some positive reminder like this could bring it to the surface there had been no further numberings of the littluns partly because there was no means of insuring that all of them were accounted for and partly because ralph knew the answer to at least one question piggy had asked on the mountaintop there were little boys fair dark freckled and all dirty but their faces were all dreadfully free of major blemishes no one had seen the mulberrycolored birthmark again but that time piggy had coaxed and bullied tacitly admitting that he remembered the unmentionable ralph nodded to piggy 	go on ask him 	piggy knelt holding the conch 	now then whats your name 	the small boy twisted away into his tent piggy turned helplessly to ralph who spoke sharply 	whats your name 	tormented by the silence and the refusal the assembly broke into a chant 	whats your name whats your name 	quiet 	ralph peered at the child in the twilight 	now tell us whats your name 	percival wemys madison the vicarage harcourt st anthony hants telephone telephone tele 	as if this information was rooted far down in the springs of sorrow the littlun wept his face puckered the tears leapt from his eyes his mouth opened till they could see a square black hole at first he was a silent effigy of sorrow but then the lamentation rose out of him loud and sustained as the conch 	shut up you shut up 	percival wemys madison would not shut up a spring had been tapped far beyond the reach of authority or even physical intimidation the crying went on breath after breath and seemed to sustain him upright as if he were nailed to it 	shut up shut up 	for now the littluns were no longer silent they were reminded of their personal sorrows and perhaps felt themselves to share in a sorrow that was universal they began to cry in sympathy two of them almost as loud as percival 	maurice saved them he cried out 	look at me 	he pretended to fall over he rubbed his rump and sat on the twister so that he fell in the grass he downed badly but percival and the others noticed and sniffed and laughed presently they were all laughing so absurdly that the biguns joined in 	jack was the first to make himself heard he had not got the conch and thus spoke against the rules but nobody minded 	and what about the beast 	something strange was happening to percival he yawned and staggered so that jack seized and shook him 	where does the beast live 	percival sagged in jacks grip 	thats a clever beast said piggy jeering if it can hide on this island 	jacks been everywhere 	where could a beast live 	beast my foot 	percival muttered something and the assembly laughed again ralph leaned forward 	what does he say 	jack listened to percivals answer and then let go of him percival released surrounded by the comfortable presence of humans fell in the long grass and went to sleep 	jack cleared his throat then reported casually 	he says the beast comes out of the sea 	the last laugh died away ralph turned involuntarily a black humped figure against the lagoon the assembly looked with him considered the vast stretches of water the high sea beyond unknown indigo of infinite possibility heard silently the sough and whisper from the reef 	maurice spoke so loudly that they jumped 	daddy said they havent found all the animals in the sea yet 	argument started again ralph held out the glimmering conch and maurice took it obediently the meeting subsided 	i mean when jack says you can be frightened because people are frightened anyway thats all right but when he says theres only pigs on this island i expect hes right but he doesnt know not really not certainly i mean maurice took a breath my daddy says theres things what dyou callem that make inksquidsthat are hundreds of yards long and eat whales whole he paused again and laughed gaily i dont believe in the beast of course as piggy says lifes scientific but we dont know do we not certainly i mean 	someone shouted 	a squid couldnt come up out of the water 	could 	couldnt 	in a moment the platform was full of arguing gesticulating shadows to ralph seated this seemed the breaking up of sanity fear beasts no general agreement that the fire was allimportant and when one tried to get the thing straight the argument sheered off bringing up fresh unpleasant matter 	he could see a whiteness in the gloom near him so he grabbed it from maurice and blew as loudly as he could the assembly was shocked into silence simon was close to him laying hands on the conch simon felt a perilous necessity to speak but to speak in assembly was a terrible thing to him 	maybe he said hesitantly maybe there is a beast 	the assembly cried out savagely and ralph stood up in amazement 	you simon you believe in this 	i dont know said simon his heartbeats were choking him but    	the storm broke 	sit down 	shut up 	take the conch 	sod you 	shut up 	ralph shouted 	hear him hes got the conch 	what i mean is    maybe its only us 	nuts 	that was from piggy shocked out of decorum simon went on 	we could be sort of    	simon became inarticulate in his effort to express mankinds essential illness inspiration came to him 	whats the dirtiest thing there is 	as an answer jack dropped into the uncomprehending silence that followed it the one crude expressive syllable release was immense those littluns who had climbed back on the twister fell off again and did not mind the hunters were screaming with delight 	simons effort fell about him in ruins the laughter beat him cruelly and he shrank away defenseless to his seat 	at last the assembly was silent again someone spoke out of turn 	maybe he means its some sort of ghost 	ralph lifted the conch and peered into the gloom the lightest thing was the pale beach surely the littluns were nearer yesthere was no doubt about it they were huddled into a tight knot of bodies in the central grass a flurry of wind made the palms talk and the noise seemed very loud now that darkness and silence made it so noticeable two grey trunks rubbed each other with an evil speaking that no one had noticed by day 	piggy took the conch out of his hands his voice was indignant 	i dont believe in no ghostsever 	jack was up too unaccountably angry 	who cares what you believefatty 	i got the conch 	there was the sound of a brief tussle and the conch moved to and fro 	you gimme the conch back 	ralph pushed between them and got a thump on the chest he wrestled the conch from someone and sat down breathlessly 	theres too much talk about ghosts we ought to have left all this for daylight 	a hushed and anonymous voice broke in 	perhaps thats what the beast isa ghost 	the assembly was shaken as by a wind 	theres too much talking out of turn ralph said because we cant have proper assemblies if you dont stick to the rules 	he stopped again the careful plan of this assembly had broken down 	what dyou want me to say then i was wrong to call this assembly so late well have a vote on them on ghosts i mean and then go to the shelters because were all tired nojack is itwait a minute ill say here and now that i dont believe in ghosts or i dont think i do but i dont like the thought of them not now that is in the dark but we were going to decide whats what 	he raised the conch for a moment 	very well then i suppose whats what is whether there are ghosts or not 	he thought for a moment formulating the question 	who thinks there may be ghosts 	for a long time there was silence and no apparent movement then ralph peered into the gloom and made out the hands he spoke flatly 	i see 	the world that understandable and lawful world was slipping away once there was this and that and now and the ship had gone 	the conch was snatched from his hands and piggys voice shrilled 	i didnt vote for no ghosts 	he whirled round on the assembly 	remember that all of you 	they heard him stamp 	what are we humans or animals or savages whats grownups going to think going offhunting pigsletting fires outand now 	a shadow fronted him tempestuously 	you shut up you fat slug 	there was a moments struggle and the glimmering conch jigged up and down ralph leapt to his feet 	jack jack you havent got the conch let him speak 	jacks face swam near him 	and you shut up who are you anyway sitting there telling people what to do you cant hunt you cant sing 	im chief i was chosen 	why should choosing make any difference just giving orders that dont make any sense 	piggys got the conch 	thats rightfavor piggy as you always do 	jack 	jacks voice sounded in bitter mimicry 	jack jack 	the rules shouted ralph youre breaking the rules 	who cares 	ralph summoned his wits 	because the rules are the only thing weve got 	but jack was shouting against him 	bollocks to the rules were strongwe hunt if theres a beast well hunt it down well close in and beat and beat and beat 	he gave a wild whoop and leapt down to the pale sand at once the platform was full of noise and excitement scramblings screams and laughter the assembly shredded away and became a discursive and random scatter from the palms to the water and away along the beach beyond nightsight ralph found his cheek touching the conch and took it from piggy 	whats grownups going to say cried piggy again look at em 	the sound of mock hunting hysterical laughter and real terror came from the beach 	blow the conch ralph 	piggy was so close that ralph could see the glint of his one glass 	theres the fire cant they see 	you got to be tough now make em do what you want 	ralph answered in the cautious voice of one who rehearses a theorem 	if i blow the conch and they dont come back then weve had it we shant keep the fire going well be like animals well never be rescued 	if you dont blow well soon be animals anyway i cant see what theyre doing but i can hear 	the dispersed figures had come together on the sand and were a dense black mass that revolved they were chanting something and littluns that had had enough were staggering away howling ralph raised the conch to his lips and then lowered it 	the trouble is are there ghosts piggy or beasts 	course there arent 	why not 	cos things wouldnt make sense houses an streets antvthey wouldnt work 	the dancing chanting boys had worked themselves away till their sound was nothing but a wordless rhythm 	but spose they dont make sense not here on this island supposing things are watching us and waiting 	ralph shuddered violently and moved closer to piggy so that they bumped frighteningly 	you stop talking like that we got enough trouble ralph an ive had as much as i can stand if there is ghosts 	i ought to give up being chief hear em 	oh lord oh no 	piggy gripped ralphs arm 	if jack was chief hed have all hunting and no fire wed be here till we died 	his voice ran up to a squeak 	whos that sitting there 	me simon 	fat lot of good we are said ralph three blind mice ill give up 	if you give up said piggy in an appalled whisper what ud happen to me 	nothing 	he hates me i dunno why if he could do what he wantedyoure all right he respects you besidesyoud hit him 	you were having a nice fight with him just now 	i had the conch said piggy simply i had a right to speak 	simon stirred in the dark 	go on being chief 	you shut up young simon why couldnt you say there wasnt a beast 	im scared of him said piggy and thats why i know him if youre scared of someone you hate him but you cant stop thinking about him you kid yourself hes all right really an then when you see him again its like asthma an you cant breathe i tell you what he hates you too ralph 	me why me 	i dunno you got him over the fire an youre chief an he isnt 	but hes hes jack merridew 	i been in bed so much i done some thinking i know about people i know about me and him he cant hurt you but if you stand out of the way hed hurt the next thing and thats me 	piggys right ralph theres you and jack go on being chief 	were all drifting and things are going rotten at home there was always a grownup please sir please miss and then you got an answer how i wish 	i wish my auntie was here 	i wish my father   oh whats the use 	keep the fire going 	the dance was over and the hunters were going back to the shelters 	grownups know things said piggy they aint afraid of the dark theyd meet and have tea and discuss then things ud be all right 	they wouldnt set fire to the island or lose 	theyd build a ship 	the three boys stood in the darkness striving unsuccessfully to convey the majesty of adult life 	they wouldnt quarrel 	or break my specs 	or talk about a beast 	if only they could get a message to us cried ralph desperately if only they could send us something grownup   a sign or something 	a thin wail out of the darkness chilled them and set them grabbing for each other then the wail rose remote and unearthly and turned to an inarticulate gibbering percival wemys madison of the vicarage harcourt st anthony lying in the long grass was living through circumstances in which the incantation of his address was powerless to help him   chapter six  beast from air  	there was no light left save that of the stars when they had understood what made this ghostly noise and percival was quiet again ralph and simon picked him up unhandily and carried him to a shelter piggy hung about near for all his brave words and the three bigger boys went together to the next shelter they lay restlessly and noisily among the dry leaves watching the patch of stars that was the opening toward the lagoon sometimes a littlun cried out from the other shelters and once a bigun spoke in the dark then they too fell asleep 	a sliver of moon rose over the horizon hardly large enough to make a path of light even when it sat right down on the water but there were other lights in the sky that moved fast winked or went out though not even a faint popping came down from the battle fought at ten miles height but a sign came down from the world of grownups though at the time there was no child awake to read it there was a sudden bright explosion and corkscrew trail across the sky then darkness again and stars there was a speck above the island a figure dropping swiftly beneath a parachute a figure that hung with dangling limbs the changing winds of various altitudes took the figure where they would then three miles up the wind steadied and bore it in a descending curve round the sky and swept it in a great slant across the reef and the lagoon toward the mountain the figure fell and crumpled among the blue flowers of the mountainside but now there was a gentle breeze at this height too and the parachute flopped and banged and pulled so the figure with feet that dragged behind it slid up the mountain yard by yard puff by puff the breeze hauled the figure through the blue flowers over the boulders and red stones till it lay huddled among the shattered rocks of the mountaintop here the breeze was fitful and allowed the strings of the parachute to tangle and festoon and the figure sat its helmeted head between its knees held by a complication of lines when the breeze blew the lines would strain taut and some accident of this pull lifted the head and chest upright so that the figure seemed to peer across the brow of the mountain then each time the wind dropped the lines would slacken and the figure bow forward again sinking its head between its knees so as the stars moved across the sky the figure sat on the mountaintop and bowed and sank and bowed again 	in the darkness of early morning there were noises by a rock a little way down the side of the mountain two boys rolled out a pile of brushwood and dead leaves two dim shadows talking sleepily to each other they were the twins on duty at the fire in theory one should have been asleep and one on watch but they could never manage to do things sensibly if that meant acting independently and since staying awake all night was impossible they had both gone to sleep now they approached the darker smudge that had been the signal fire yawning rubbing their eyes treading with practiced feet when they reached it they stopped yawning and one ran quickly back for brushwood and leaves 	the other knelt down 	i believe its out 	he fiddled with the sticks that were pushed into his hands 	no 	he lay down and put his lips close to the smudge and blew soffly his face appeared lit redly he stopped blowing for a moment 	samgive us 	tinder wood 	eric bent down and blew softly again till the patch was bright sam poked the piece of tinder wood into the hot spot then a branch the glow increased and the branch took fire sam piled on more branches 	dont burn the lot said eric youre putting on too much 	lets warm up 	well only have to fetch more wood 	im cold 	som i 	besides its 	dark all right then 	eric squatted back and watched sam make up the fire he built a little tent of dead wood and the fire was safely alight 	that was near 	hed have been 	waxy 	huh 	for a few moments the twins watched the fire in silence then eric sniggered 	wasnt he waxy 	about the 	fire and the pig 	lucky he went for jack stead of us 	huh remember old waxy at school 	boyyouaredrivingmeslowlyinsane 	the twins shared their identical laughter then remembered the darkness and other things and glanced round uneasily the flames busy about the tent drew their eyes back again eric watched the scurrying woodlice that were so frantically unable to avoid the flames and thought of the first firejust down there on the steeper side of the mountain where now was complete darkness he did not like to remember it and looked away at the mountaintop 	warmth radiated now and beat pleasantly on them sam amused himself by fitting branches into the fire as closely as possible eric spread out his hands searching for the distance at which the heat was just bearable idly looking beyond the fire he resettled the scattered rocks from their flat shadows into daylight contours just there was the big rock and the three stones there that split rock and there beyond was a gapjust there  	sam 	huh 	nothing 	the flames were mastering the branches the bark was curling and falling away the wood exploding the tent fell inwards and flung a wide circle of light over the mountaintop 	sam 	huh 	sam sam 	sam looked at eric irritably the intensity of erics gaze made the direction in which he looked terrible for sam had his back to it he scrambled round the fire squatted by eric and looked to see they became motionless gripped in each others arms four unwinking eyes aimed and two mouths open 	far beneath them the trees of the forest sighed then roared the hair on their foreheads fluttered and flames blew out sideways from the fire fifteen yards away from them came the plopping noise of fabric blown open 	neither of the boys screamed but the grip of their arms tightened and their mouths grew peaked for perhaps ten seconds they crouched like that while the flailing fire sent smoke and sparks and waves of inconstant light over the top of the mountain 	then as though they had but one terrified mind between them they scrambled away over the rocks and fled  	ralph was dreaming he had fallen asleep after what seemed hours of tossing and turning noisily among the dry leaves even the sounds of nightmare from the other shelters no longer reached him for he was back to where he came from feeding the ponies with sugar over the garden wall then someone was shaking his arm telling him that it was time for tea 	ralph wake up 	the leaves were roaring like the sea 	ralph wake up 	whats the matter 	we saw 	the beast 	plain 	who are you the twins 	we saw the beast 	quiet piggy 	the leaves were roaring still piggy bumped into him and a twin grabbed him as he made for the oblong of paling stars 	you cant go outits horrible 	piggywhere are the spears 	i can hear the 	quiet then lie still 	they lay there listening at first with doubt but then with terror to the description the twins breathed at them between bouts of extreme silence soon the darkness was full of claws full of the awful unknown and menace an interminable dawn faded the stars out and at last light sad and grey filtered into the shelter they began to stir though still the world outside the shelter was impossibly dangerous the maze of the darkness sorted into near and far and at the high point of the sky the cloudlets were warmed with color a single sea bird flapped upwards with a hoarse cry that was echoed presently and something squawked in the forest now streaks of cloud near the horizon began to glow rosily and the feathery tops of the palms were green 	ralph knelt in the entrance to the shelter and peered cautiously round him 	sam n eric call them to an assembly quietly go on 	the twins holding tremulously to each other dared the few yards to the next shelter and spread the dreadful news ralph stood up and walked for the sake of dignity though with his back pricking to the platform piggy and simon followed him and the other boys came sneaking after 	ralph took the conch from where it lay on the polished seat and held it to his lips but then he hesitated and did not blow he held the shell up instead and showed it to them and they understood 	the rays of the sun that were fanning upwards from below the horizon swung downwards to eyelevel ralph looked for a moment at the growing slice of gold that lit them from the right hand and seemed to make speech possible the circle of boys before him bristled with hunting spears 	he handed the conch to eric the nearest of the twins 	weve seen the beast with our own eyes nowe werent asleep 	sam took up the story by custom now one conch did for both twins for their substantial unity was recognized 	it was furry there was something moving behind its headwings the beast moved too 	that was awful it kind of sat up 	the fire was bright 	wed just made it up 	more sticks on 	there were eyes 	teeth 	claws 	we ran as fast as we could 	bashed into things 	the beast followed us 	i saw it slinking behind the trees 	nearly touched me 	ralph pointed fearfully at erics face which was striped with scars where the bushes had torn him 	how did you do that 	eric felt his face 	im all rough am i bleeding 	the circle of boys shrank away in horror johnny yawning still burst into noisy tears and was slapped by bill till he choked on them the bright morning was full of threats and the circle began to change it faced out rather than in and the spears of sharpened wood were like a fence jack called them back to the center 	thisll be a real hunt wholl come 	ralph moved impatiently 	these spears are made of wood dont be silly 	jack sneered at him 	frightened 	course im frightened who wouldnt be 	he turned to the twins yearning but hopeless 	i suppose you arent pulling our legs 	the reply was too emphatic for anyone to doubt them 	piggy took the conch 	couldnt wekind ofstay here maybe the beast wont come near us 	but for the sense of something watching them ralph would have shouted at him 	stay here and be cramped into this bit of the island always on the lookout how should we get our food and what about the fire 	lets be moving said jack relentlessly were wasting time 	no were not what about the littluns 	sucks to the littluns 	someones got to look after them 	nobody has so far 	there was no need now there is piggyll look after them 	thats right keep piggy out of danger 	have some sense what can piggy do with only one eye 	the rest of the boys were looking from jack to ralph curiously 	and another thing you cant have an ordinary hunt because the beast doesnt leave tracks if it did youd have seen them for all we know the beast may swing through the trees like whats its name 	they nodded 	so weve got to think 	piggy took off his damaged glasses and cleaned the remaining lens 	how about us ralph 	you havent got the conch here 	i meanhow about us suppose the beast comes when youre all away i cant see proper and if i get scared 	jack broke in contemptuously 	youre always scared 	i got the conch 	conch conch shouted jack we dont need the conch any more we know who ought to say things what good did simon do speaking or bill or walter its time some people knew theyve got to keep quiet and leave deciding things to the rest of us 	ralph could no longer ignore his speech the blood was hot in his cheeks 	you havent got the conch he said sit down 	jacks face went so white that the freckles showed as clear brown flecks he licked his lips and remained standing 	this is a hunters job 	the rest of the boys watched intently piggy finding himself uncomfortably embroiled slid the conch to ralphs knees and sat down the silence grew oppressive and piggy held his breath 	this is more than a hunters job said ralph at last because you cant track the beast and dont you want to be rescued 	he turned to the assembly 	dont you all want to be rescued 	he looked back at jack 	i said before the fire is the main thing now the fire must be out 	the old exasperation saved him and gave him the energy to attack 	hasnt anyone got any sense weve got to relight that fire you never thought of that jack did you or dont any of you want to be rescued 	yes they wanted to be rescued there was no doubt about that and with a violent swing to ralphs side the crisis passed piggy let out his breath with a gasp reached for it again and failed he lay against a log his mouth gaping blue shadows creeping round his lips nobody minded him 	now think jack is there anywhere on the island you havent been 	unwillingly jack answered 	theres onlybut of course you remember the tailend part where the rocks are all piled up ive been near there the rock makes a sort of bridge theres only one way up 	and the thing might live there 	all the assembly talked at once 	quite all right thats where well look if the beast isnt there well go up the mountain and look and light the fire 	lets go 	well eat first then go ralph paused wed better take spears 	after they had eaten ralph and the biguns set out along the beach they left piggy propped up on the platform this day promised like the others to be a sunbath under a blue dome the beach stretched away before them in a gentle curve till perspective drew it into one with the forest for the day was not advanced enough to be obscured by the shifting veils of mirage under ralphs direction they picked up a careful way along the palm terrace rather than dare the hot sand down by the water he let jack lead the way and jack trod with theatrical caution though they could have seen an enemy twenty yards away ralph walked in the rear thankful to have escaped responsibility for a time 	simon walking in front of ralph felt a flicker of incredulitya beast with claws that scratched that sat on a mountaintop that left no tracks and yet was not fast enough to catch samneric however simon thought of the beast there rose before his inward sight the picture of a human at once heroic and sick 	he sighed other people could stand up and speak to an assembly apparently without that dreadful feeling of the pressure of personality could say what they would as though they were speaking to only one person he stepped aside and looked back ralph was coming along holding his spear over his shoulder diffidently simon allowed his pace to slacken until he was walking side by side with ralph and looking up at him through the coarse black hair that now fell to his eyes ralph glanced sideways smiled constrainedly as though he had forgotten that simon had made a fool of himself then looked away again at nothing for a moment or two simon was happy to be accepted and then he ceased to think about himself when he bashed into a tree ralph looked sideways impatiently and robert sniggered simon reeled and a white spot on his forehead turned red and trickled ralph dismissed simon and returned to his personal hell they would reach the castle some time and the chief would have to go forward 	jack came trotting back were in sight now 	all right well get as close as we can 	he followed jack toward the castle where the ground rose slightly on their left was an impenetrable tangle of creepers and trees 	why couldnt there be something in that 	because you can see nothing goes in or out 	what about the castle then 	look 	ralph parted the screen of grass and looked out there were only a few more yards of stony ground and then the two sides of the island came almost together so that one expected a peak of headland but instead of this a narrow ledge of rock a few yards wide and perhaps fifteen long continued the island out into the sea there lay another of those pieces of pink squareness that underlay the structure of the island this side of the castle perhaps a hundred feet high was the pink bastion they had seen from the mountaintop the rock of the cliff was split and the top littered with great lumps that seemed to totter 	behind ralph the tall grass had filled with silent hunters ralph looked at jack 	youre a hunter 	jack went red 	i know all right 	something deep in ralph spoke for him 	im chief ill go dont argue 	he turned to the others 	you hide here wait for me 	he found his voice tended either to disappear or to come out too loud he looked at jack 	do youthink 	jack muttered 	ive been all over it must be here 	i see 	simon mumbled confusedly i dont believe in the beast 	ralph answered him politely as if agreeing about the weather 	no i suppose not 	his mouth was tight and pale he put back his hair very slowly 	well so long 	he forced his feet to move until they had carried him out on to the neck of land 	he was surrounded on all sides by chasms of empty air there was nowhere to hide even if one did not have to go on he paused on the narrow neck and looked down soon in a matter of centuries the sea would make an island of the castle on the right hand was the lagoon troubled by the open sea and on the left ralph shuddered the lagoon had protected them from the pacific and for some reason only jack had gone right down to the water on the other side now he saw the landsmans view of the swell and it seemed like the breathing of some stupendous creature slowly the waters sank among the rocks revealing pink tables of granite strange growths of coral polyp and weed down down the waters went whispering like the wind among the heads of the forest there was one flat rock there spread like a table and the waters sucking down on the four weedy sides made them seem like cliffs then the sleeping leviathan breathed out the waters rose the weed streamed and the water boiled over the table rock with a roar there was no sense of the passage of waves only this minutelong fall and rise and fall 	ralph turned away to the red cliff they were waiting behind him in the long grass waiting to see what he would do he noticed that the sweat in his palm was cool now realized with surprise that he did not really expect to meet any beast and didnt know what he would do about it if he did 	he saw that he could climb the cliff but this was not necessary the squareness of the rock allowed a sort of plinth round it so that to the right over the lagoon one could inch along a ledge and turn the corner out of sight it was easy going and soon he was peering round the rock 	nothing but what you might expect pink tumbled boulders with guano layered on them like icing and a steep slope up to the shattered rocks that crowned the bastion 	a sound behind him made him turn jack was edging along the ledge 	couldnt let you do it on your own 	ralph said nothing he led the way over the rocks inspected a sort of halfcave that held nothing more terrible than a clutch of rotten eggs and at last sat down looking round him and tapping the rock with the butt of his spear 	jack was excited 	what a place for a fort 	a column of spray wetted them 	no fresh water 	whats that then 	there was indeed a long green smudge halfway up the rock they climbed up and tasted the trickle of water 	you could keep a coconut shell there filling all the time 	not me this is a rotten place 	side by side they scaled the last height to where the diminishing pile was crowned by the last broken rock jack struck the near one with his fist and it grated slightly 	do you remember 	consciousness of the bad times in between came to them both jack talked quickly 	shove a palm trunk under that and if an enemy came look 	a hundred feet below them was the narrow causeway then the stony ground then the grass dotted with heads and behind that the forest 	one heave cried jack exulting andwheee 	he made a sweeping movement with his hand ralph looked toward the mountain 	whats the matter 	ralph turned 	why 	you were lookingi dont know why 	theres no signal now nothing to show 	youre nuts on the signal 	the taut blue horizon encircled them broken only by the mountaintop 	thats all weve got 	he leaned his spear against the rocking stone and pushed back two handfuls of hair 	well have to go back and climb the mountain thats where they saw the beast 	the beast wont be there 	what else can we do 	the others waiting in the grass saw jack and ralph unharmed and broke cover into the sunlight they forgot the beast in the excitement of exploration they swarmed across the bridge and soon were climbing and shouting ralph stood now one hand against an enormous red block a block large as a mill wheel that had been split off and hung tottering somberly he watched the mountain he clenched his fist and beat hammerwise on the red wall at his right his lips were tightly compressed and his eyes yearned beneath the fringe of hair 	smoke 	he sucked his bruised fist  	jack come on 	but jack was not there a knot of boys making a great noise that he had not noticed were heaving and pushing at a rock as he turned the base cracked and the whole mass toppled into the sea so that a thunderous plume of spray leapt halfway up the cliff 	stop it stop it 	his voice struck a silence among them 	smoke 	a strange thing happened in his head something flittered there in front of his mind like a bats wing obscuring his idea 	smoke 	at once the ideas were back and the anger 	we want smoke and you go wasting your time you roll rocks 	roger shouted 	weve got plenty of time 	ralph shook his head 	well go to the mountain 	the clamor broke out some of the boys wanted to go back to the beach some wanted to roll more rocks the sun was bright and danger had faded with the darkness 	jack the beast might be on the other side you can lead again youve been 	we could go by the shore theres fruit 	bill came up to ralph 	why cant we stay here for a bit 	thats right 	lets have a fort 	theres no food here said ralph and no shelter not much fresh water 	this would make a wizard fort 	we can roll rocks 	right onto the bridge 	i say well go on shouted ralph furiously weve got to make certain well go now 	lets stay here 	back to the shelter 	im tired 	no 	ralph struck the skin off his knuckles they did not seem to hurt 	im chief weve got to make certain cant you see the mountain theres no signal showing there may be a ship out there are you all off your rockers 	mutinously the boys fell silent or muttering 	jack led the way down the rock and across the bridge   chapter seven  shadows and tall trees  	the pigrun kept close to the jumble of rocks that lay down by the water on the other side and ralph was content to follow jack along it if you could shut your ears to the slow suck down of the sea and boil of the return if you could forget how dun and unvisited were the ferny coverts on either side then there was a chance that you might put the beast out of mind and dream for a while the sun had swung over the vertical and the afternoon heat was closing in on the island ralph passed a message forward to jack and when they next came to fruit the whole party stopped and ate 	sitting ralph was aware of the heat for the first time that day he pulled distastefully at his grey shirt and wondered whether he might undertake the adventure of washing it sitting under what seemed an unusual heat even for this island ralph planned his toilet he would like to have a pair of scissors and cut this hairhe flung the mass backcut this filthy hair right back to half an inch he would like to have a bath a proper wallow with soap he passed his tongue experimentally over his teeth and decided that a toothbrush would come in handy too then there were his nails  	ralph turned his hand over and examined them they were bitten down to the quick though he could not remember when he had restarted this habit nor any time when he indulged it 	be sucking my thumb next 	he looked round furtively apparently no one had heard the hunters sat stuffing themselves with this easy meal trying to convince themselves that they got sufficient kick out of bananas and that other olivegrey jellylike fruit with the memory of his sometime clean self as a standard ralph looked them over they were dirty not with the spectacular dirt of boys who have fallen into mud or been brought down hard on a rainy day not one of them was an obvious subject for a shower and yethair much too long tangled here and there knotted round a dead leaf or a twig faces cleaned fairly well by the process of eating and sweating but marked in the less accessible angles with a kind of shadow clothes worn away stiff like his own with sweat put on not for decorum or comfort but out of custom the skin of the body scurfy with brine  	he discovered with a little fall of the heart that these were the conditions he took as normal now and that he did not mind he sighed and pushed away the stalk from which he had stripped the fruit already the hunters were stealing away to do their business in the woods or down by the rocks he turned and looked out to sea 	here on the other side of the island the view was utterly different the filmy enchantments of mirage could not endure the cold ocean water and the horizon was hard clipped blue ralph wandered down to the rocks down here almost on a level with the sea you could follow with your eye the ceaseless bulging passage of the deep sea waves they were miles wide apparently not breakers or the banked ridges of shallow water they traveled the length of the island with an air of disregarding it and being set on other business they were less a progress than a momentous rise and fall of the whole ocean now the sea would suck down making cascades and waterfalls of retreating water would sink past the rocks and plaster down the seaweed like shining hair then pausing gather and rise with a roar irresistibly swelling over point and outcrop climbing the little cliff sending at last an arm of surf up a gully to end a yard or so from him in fingers of spray 	wave after wave ralph followed the rise and fall until something of the remoteness of the sea numbed his brain then gradually the almost infinite size of this water forced itself on his attention this was the divider the barrier on the other side of the island swathed at midday with mirage defended by the shield of the quiet lagoon one might dream of rescue but here faced by the brute obtuseness of the ocean the miles of division one was clamped down one was helpless one was condemned one was  	simon was speaking almost in his ear ralph found that he had rock painfully gripped in both hands found his body arched the muscles of his neck stiff his mouth strained open 	youll get back to where you came from 	simon nodded as he spoke he was kneeling on one knee looking down from a higher rock which he held with both hands his other leg stretched down to ralphs level 	ralph was puzzled and searched simons face for a clue 	its so big i mean 	simon nodded 	all the same youll get back all right i think so anyway 	some of the strain had gone from ralphs body he glanced at the sea and then smiled bitterly at simon 	got a ship in your pocket 	simon grinned and shook his head 	how do you know then 	when simon was still silent ralph said curtly youre batty 	simon shook his head violently till the coarse black hair flew backwards and forwards across his face 	no im not i just think youll get back all right 	for a moment nothing more was said and then they suddenly smiled at each other  	roger called from the coverts 	come and see 	the ground was turned over near the pigrun and there were droppings that steamed jack bent down to them as though he loved them 	ralphwe need meat even if we are hunting the other thing 	if you mean going the right way well hunt 	they set off again the hunters bunched a little by fear of the mentioned beast while jack quested ahead they went more slowly than ralph had bargained for yet in a way he was glad to loiter cradling his spear jack came up against some emergency of his craft and soon the procession stopped ralph leaned against a tree and at once the daydreams came swarming up jack was in charge of the hunt and there would be time to get to the mountain  	once following his father from chatham to devonport they had lived in a cottage on the edge of the moors in the succession of houses that ralph had known this one stood out with particular clarity because after that house he had been sent away to school mummy had still been with them and daddy had come home every day wild ponies came to the stone wall at the bottom of the garden and it had snowed just behind the cottage there was a sort of shed and you could lie up there watching the flakes swirl past you could see the damp spot where each flake died then you could mark the first flake that lay down without melting and watch the whole ground turn white you could go indoors when you were cold and look out of the window past the bright copper kettle and the plate with the little blue men 	when you went to bed there was a bowl of cornflakes with sugar and cream and the booksthey stood on the shelf by the bed leaning together with always two or three laid flat on top because he had not bothered to put them back properly they were dogeared and scratched there was the bright shining one about topsy and mopsy that he never read because it was about two girls there was the one about the magician which you read with a kind of tieddown terror skipping page twentyseven with the awful picture of the spider there was a book about people who had dug things up egyptian things there was the boys book of trains the boys book of ships vividly they came before him he could have reached up and touched them could feel the weight and slow slide with which the mammoth book for boys would come out and slither down    everything was all right everything was goodhumored and friendly 	the bushes crashed ahead of them boys flung themselves wildly from the pig track and scrabbled in the creepers screaming ralph saw jack nudged aside and fall then there was a creature bounding along the pig track toward him with tusks gleaming and an intimidating grunt ralph found he was able to measure the distance coldly and take aim with the boar only five yards away he flung the foolish wooden stick that he carried saw it hit the great snout and hang there for a moment the boars note changed to a squeal and it swerved aside into the covert the pigrun filled with shouting boys again jack came running back and poked about in the undergrowth 	through here 	but hed do us 	through here i said 	the boar was floundering away from them they found another pigrun parallel to the first and jack raced away ralph was full of fright and apprehension and pride 	i hit him the spear stuck in 	now they came unexpectedly to an open space by the sea jack cast about on the bare rock and looked anxious 	hes gone 	i hit him said ralph again and the spear stuck in a bit 	he felt the need of witnesses 	didnt you see me 	maurice nodded 	i saw you right bang on his snoutwheee 	ralph talked on excitedly 	i hit him all right the spear stuck in i wounded him 	he sunned himself in their new respect and felt that hunting was good after all 	i walloped him properly that was the beast i think jack came back 	that wasnt the beast that was a boar 	i hit him 	why didnt you grab him i tried 	ralphs voice ran up 	but a boar 	jack flushed suddenly 	you said hed do us what did you want to throw for why didnt you wait 	he held out his arm 	look 	he turned his left forearm for them all to see on the outside was a rip not much but bloody 	he did that with his tusks i couldnt get my spear down in time 	attention focused on jack 	thats a wound said simon and you ought to suck it like berengaria 	jack sucked 	i hit him said ralph indignantly i hit him with my spear i wounded him 	he tried for their attention 	he was coming along the path i threw like this 	robert snarled at him ralph entered into the play and everybody laughed presently they were all jabbing at robert who made mock rushes 	jack shouted 	make a ring 	the circle moved in and round robert squealed in mock terror then in real pain 	ow stop it youre hurting 	the butt end of a spear fell on his back as he blundered among them  	hold him	 	they got his arms and legs ralph carried away by a sudden thick excitement grabbed erics spear and jabbed at robert with it 	kill him kill him 	all at once robert was screaming and struggling with the strength of frenzy jack had him by the hair and was brandishing his knife behind him was roger fighting to get close the chant rose ritually as at the last moment of a dance or a hunt 	kill the pig cut his throat kill the pig bash him in 	ralph too was fighting to get near to get a handful of that brown vulnerable flesh the desire to squeeze and hurt was overmastering 	jacks arm came down the heaving circle cheered and made pigdying noises then they lay quiet panting listening to roberts frightened snivels he wiped his face with a dirty arm and made an effort to retrieve his status 	oh my bum 	he rubbed his rump ruefully jack rolled over 	that was a good game 	just a game said ralph uneasily i got jolly badly hurt at rugger once 	we ought to have a drum said maurice then we could do it properly 	ralph looked at him 	how properly 	i dunno you want a fire i think and a drum and you keep time to the drum 	you want a pig said roger like a real hunt 	or someone to pretend said jack you could get someone to dress up as a pig and then he could actyou know pretend to knock me over and all that 	you want a real pig said robert still caressing his rump because youve got to kill him 	use a littlun said jack and everybody laughed  	ralph sat up 	well we shant find what were looking for at this rate 	one by one they stood up twitching rags into place 	ralph looked at jack 	now for the mountain 	shouldnt we go back to piggy said maurice before dark 	the twins nodded like one boy 	yes thats right lets go up there in the morning 	ralph looked out and saw the sea 	weve got to start the fire again 	you havent got piggys specs said jack so you cant 	then well find out if the mountains clear 	maurice spoke hesitating not wanting to seem a funk 	supposing the beasts up there 	jack brandished his spear 	well kill it 	the sun seemed a little cooler he slashed with the spear 	what are we waiting for 	i suppose said ralph if we keep on by the sea this way well come out below the burnt bit and then we can climb the mountain 	once more jack led them along by the suck and heave of the blinding sea  	once more ralph dreamed letting his skillful feet deal with the difficulties of the path yet here his feet seemed less skillful than before for most of the way they were forced right down to the bare rock by the water and had to edge along between that and the dark luxuriance of the forest there were little cliffs to be scaled some to be used as paths lengthy traverses where one used hands as well as feet here and there they could clamber over wavewet rock leaping across clear pools that the tide had left they came to a gully that split the narrow foreshore like a defense this seemed to have no bottom and they peered awestricken into the gloomy crack where water gurgled then the wave came back the gully boiled before them and spray dashed up to the very creeper so that the boys were wet and shrieking they tried the forest but it was thick and woven like a birds nest in the end they had to jump one by one waiting till the water sank and even so some of them got a second drenching after that the rocks seemed to be growing impassable so they sat for a time letting their rags dry and watching the clipped outlines of the rollers that moved so slowly past the island they found fruit in a haunt of bright little birds that hovered like insects then ralph said they were going too slowly he himself climbed a tree and parted the canopy and saw the square head of the mountain seeming still a great way off then they tried to hurry along the rocks and robert cut his knee quite badly and they had to recognize that this path must be taken slowly if they were to be safe so they proceeded after that as if they were climbing a dangerous mountain until the rocks became an uncompromising cliff overhung with impossible jungle and falling sheer into the sea 	ralph looked at the sun critically 	early evening after teatime at any rate 	i dont remember this cliff said jack crestfallen so this must be the bit of the coast i missed 	ralph nodded 	let me think 	by now ralph had no selfconsciousness in public thinking but would treat the days decisions as though he were playing chess the only trouble was that he would never be a very good chess player he thought of the littluns and piggy vividly he imagined piggy by himself huddled in a shelter that was silent except for the sounds of nightmare 	we cant leave the littluns alone with piggy not all night 	the other boys said nothing but stood round watching him 	if we went back we should take hours 	jack cleared his throat and spoke in a queer tight voice we mustnt let anything happen to piggy must we ralph tapped his teeth with the dirty point of erics spear 	if we go across 	he glanced round him 	someones got to go across the island and tell piggy well be back after dark 	bill spoke unbelieving 	through the forest by himself now 	we cant spare more than one 	simon pushed his way to ralphs elbow 	ill go if you like i dont mind honestly 	before ralph had time to reply he smiled quickly turned and climbed into the forest 	ralph looked back at jack seeing him infuriatingly for the first time 	jackthat time you went the whole way to the castle rock 	jack glowered 	yes 	you came along part of this shorebelow the mountain beyond there 	yes 	and then 	i found a pigrun it went for miles 	so the pigrun must be somewhere in there 	ralph nodded he pointed at the forest 	everybody agreed sagely 	all right then well smash a way through till we find the pigrun 	he took a step and halted 	wait a minute though where does the pigrun go to 	the mountain said jack i told you he sneered dont you want to go to the mountain 	ralph sighed sensing the rising antagonism understanding that this was how jack felt as soon as he ceased to lead 	i was thinking of the light well be stumbling about 	we were going to look for the beast 	there wont be enough light 	i dont mind going said jack hotly ill go when we get there wont you would you rather go back to the shelters and tell piggy 	now it was ralphs turn to flush but he spoke despairingly out of the new understanding that piggy had given him 	why do you hate me 	the boys stirred uneasily as though something indecent had been said the silence lengthened 	ralph still hot and hurt turned away first 	come on 	he led the way and set himself as by right to hack at the tangles jack brought up the rear displaced and brooding 	the pigtrack was a dark tunnel for the sun was sliding quickly toward the edge of the world and in the forest shadows were never far to seek the track was broad and beaten and they ran along at a swift trot then the roof of leaves broke up and they halted breathing quickly looking at the few stars that pricked round the head of the mountain 	there you are 	the boys peered at each other doubtfully ralph made a decision 	well go straight across to the platform and climb tomorrow 	they murmured agreement but jack was standing by his shoulder 	if youre frightened of course  	ralph turned on him 	who went first on the castle rock 	i went too and that was daylight 	all right who wants to climb the mountain now silence was the only answer 	samneric what about you 	we ought to go an tell piggy 	yes tell piggy that 	but simon went 	we ought to tell piggyin case 	robert bill 	they were going straight back to the platform now not of course that they were afraidbut tired 	ralph turned back to jack 	you see 	im going up the mountain the words came from jack viciously as though they were a curse he looked at ralph his thin body tensed his spear held as if he threatened him 	im going up the mountain to look for the beastnow then the supreme sting the casual bitter word coming 	at that word the other boys forgot their urge to be gone and turned back to sample this fresh rub of two spirits in the dark the word was too good too bitter too successfully daunting to be repeated it took ralph at low water when his nerve was relaxed for the return to the shelter and the still friendly waters of the lagoon 	i dont mind 	astonished he heard his voice come out cool and casual so that the bitterness of jacks taunt fell powerless 	if you dont mind of course 	oh not at all 	jack took a step 	well then 	side by side watched by silent boys the two started up the mountain 	ralph stopped 	were silly why should only two go if we find anything two wont be enough 	there came the sound of boys scuttling away astonishingly a dark figure moved against the tide 	roger 	yes 	thats three then 	once more they set out to climb the slope of the mountain the darkness seemed to flow round them like a tide jack who had said nothing began to choke and cough and a gust of wind set all three spluttering ralphs eyes were blinded with tears 	ashes were on the edge of the burnt patch 	their footsteps and the occasional breeze were stirring up small devils of dust now that they stopped again ralph had time while he coughed to remember how silly they were if there was no beastand almost certainly there was no beastin that case well and good but if there was something waiting on top of the mountain what was the use of three of them handicapped by the darkness and carrying only sticks 	were being fools 	out of the darkness came the answer 	windy 	irritably ralph shook himself this was all jacks fault 	course i am but were still being fools 	if you dont want to go on said the voice sarcastically ill go up by myself 	ralph heard the mockery and hated jack the sting of ashes in his eyes tiredness fear enraged him 	go on then well wait here 	there was silence 	why dont you go are you frightened a stain in the darkness a stain that was jack detached itself and began to draw away 	all right so long 	the stain vanished another took its place  	ralph felt his knee against something hard and rocked a charred trunk that was edgy to the touch he felt the sharp cinders that had been bark push against the back of his knee and knew that roger had sat down he felt with his hands and lowered himself beside roger while the trunk rocked among invisible ashes roger uncommunicative by nature said nothing he offered no opinion on the beast nor told ralph why he had chosen to come on this mad expedition he simply sat and rocked the trunk gently ralph noticed a rapid and infuriating tapping noise and realized that roger was banging his silly wooden stick against something 	so they sat the rocking tapping impervious roger and ralph fuming round them the close sky was loaded with stars save where the mountain punched up a hole of blackness 	there was a slithering noise high above them the sound of someone taking giant and dangerous strides on rock or ash then jack found them and was shivering and croaking in a voice they could just recognize as his 	i saw a thing on top 	they heard him blunder against the trunk which rocked violently he lay silent for a moment then muttered 	keep a good lookout it may be following 	a shower of ash pattered round them jack sat up 	i saw a thing bulge on the mountain 	you only imagined it said ralph shakily because nothing would bulge not any sort of creature 	roger spoke they jumped for they had forgotten him 	a frog 	jack giggled and shuddered 	some frog there was a noise too a kind of plop noise then the thing bulged 	ralph surprised himself not so much by the quality of his voice which was even but by the bravado of its intention 	well go and look 	for the first time since he had first known jack ralph could feel him hesitate 	now 	his voice spoke for him 	of course 	he got off the trunk and led the way across the clinking cinders up into the dark and the others followed 	now that his physical voice was silent the inner voice of reason and other voices too made themselves heard piggy was calling him a kid another voice told him not to be a fool and the darkness and desperate enterprise gave the night a kind of dentists chair unreality 	as they came to the last slope jack and roger drew near changed from the inkstains to distinguishable figures by common consent they stopped and crouched together behind them on the horizon was a patch of lighter sky where in a moment the moon would rise the wind roared once in the forest and pushed their rags against them 	ralph stirred 	come on 	they crept forward roger lagging a little jack and ralph turned the shoulder of the mountain together the glittering lengths of the lagoon lay below them and beyond that a long white smudge that was the reef roger joined them  	jack whispered 	lets creep forward on hands and knees maybe its asleep 	roger and ralph moved on this time leaving jack in the rear for all his brave words they came to the flat top where the rock was hard to hands and knees 	a creature that bulged 	ralph put his hand in the cold soft ashes of the fire and smothered a cry his hand and shoulder were twitching from the unlookedfor contact green lights of nausea appeared for a moment and ate into the darkness roger lay behind him and jacks mouth was at his ear 	over there where there used to be a gap in the rock a sort of humpsee 	ashes blew into ralphs face from the dead fire he could not see the gap or anything else because the green lights were opening again and growing and the top of the mountain was sliding sideways 	once more from a distance he heard jacks whisper 	scared 	not scared so much as paralyzed hung up there immovable on the top of a diminishing moving mountain jack slid away from him roger bumped fumbled with a hiss of breath and passed onwards he heard them whispering 	can you see anything 	there 	in front of them only three or four yards away was a rocklike hump where no rock should be ralph could hear a tiny chattering noise coming from somewhere perhaps from his own mouth he bound himself together with his will fused his fear and loathing into a hatred and stood up he took two leaden steps forward 	behind them the silver of moon had drawn clear of the horizon before them something like a great ape was sitting asleep with its head between its knees then the wind roared in the forest there was confusion in the darkness and the creature lifted its head holding toward them the ruin of a face 	ralph found himself taking giant strides among the ashes heard other creatures crying out and leaping and dared the impossible on the dark slope presently the mountain was deserted save for the three abandoned sticks and the thing that bowed   chapter eight  gift for the darkness  	piggy looked up miserably from the dawnpale beach to the dark mountain 	are you sure really sure i mean 	i told you a dozen times now said ralph we saw it 	dyou think were safe down here 	how the hell should i know 	ralph jerked away from him and walked a few paces along the beach jack was kneeling and drawing a circular pattern in the sand with his forefinger piggys voice came to them hushed 	are you sure really 	go up and see said jack contemptuously and good riddance 	no fear 	the beast had teeth said ralph and big black eyes 	he shuddered violently piggy took off his one round of glass and polished the surface 	what we going to do 	ralph turned toward the platform the conch glimmered among the trees a white blob against the place where the sun would rise he pushed back his mop 	i dont know 	he remembered the panic flight down the mountainside i dont think wed ever fight a thing that size honestly you know wed talk but we wouldnt fight a tiger wed hide even jack ud hide 	jack still looked at the sand 	what about my hunters 	simon came stealing out of the shadows by the shelters ralph ignored jacks question he pointed to the touch of yellow above the sea 	as long as theres light were brave enough but then and now that thing squats by the fire as though it didnt want us to be rescued 	he was twisting his hands now unconsciously his voice rose 	so we cant have a signal fire    were beaten 	a point of gold appeared above the sea and at once all the sky lightened 	what about my hunters 	boys armed with sticks 	jack got to his feet his face was red as he marched away piggy put on his one glass and looked at ralph 	now you done it you been rude about his hunters 	oh shut up 	the sound of the inexpertly blown conch interrupted them as though he were serenading the rising sun jack went on blowing till the shelters were astir and the hunters crept to the platform and the littluns whimpered as now they so frequently did ralph rose obediently and piggy and they went to the platform 	talk said ralph bitterly talk talk talk 	he took the conch from jack 	this meeting 	jack interrupted him 	i called it 	if you hadnt called it i should have you just blew the conch 	well isnt that calling it 	oh take it go ontalk 	ralph thrust the conch into jacks arms and sat down on the trunk 	ive called an assembly said jack because of a lot of things first you know now weve seen the beast we crawled up we were only a few feet away the beast sat up and looked at us i dont know what it does we dont even know what it is 	the beast comes out of the sea 	out of the dark 	trees 	quiet shouted jack you listen the beast is sitting up there whatever it is 	perhaps its waiting 	hunting 	yes hunting 	hunting said jack he remembered his ageold tremors in the forest yes the beast is a hunter only shut up the next thing is that we couldnt kill it and the next is that ralph said my hunters are no good 	i never said that 	ive got the conch ralph thinks youre cowards running away from the boar and the beast and thats not all 	there was a kind of sigh on the platform as if everyone knew what was coming jacks voice went up tremulous yet determined pushing against the uncooperative silence 	hes like piggy he says things like piggy he isnt a proper chief 	jack clutched the conch to him 	hes a coward himself 	for a moment he paused and then went on 	on top when roger and me went onhe stayed back 	i went too 	after 	the two boys glared at each other through screens of hair 	i went on too said ralph then i ran away so did you 	call me a coward then 	jack turned to the hunters 	hes not a hunter hed never have got us meat he isnt a prefect and we dont know anything about him he just gives orders and expects people to obey for nothing all this talk 	all this talk shouted ralph talk talk who wanted it who called the meeting 	jack turned red in the face his chin sunk back he glowered up under his eyebrows 	all right then he said in tones of deep meaning and menace all right 	he held the conch against his chest with one hand and stabbed the air with his index finger 	who thinks ralph oughtnt to be chief 	he looked expectantly at the boys ranged round who had frozen under the palms there was deadly silence 	hands up said jack strongly whoever wants ralph not to be chief 	the silence continued breathless and heavy and full of shame slowly the red drained from jacks cheeks then came back with a painful rush he licked his lips and turned his head at an angle so that his gaze avoided the embarrassment of linking with anothers eye 	how many think 	his voice tailed off the hands that held the conch shook he cleared his throat and spoke loudly 	all right then 	he laid the conch with great care in the grass at his feet the humiliating tears were running from the corner of each eye 	im not going to play any longer not with you 	most of the boys were looking down now at the grass or their feet jack cleared his throat again 	im not going to be a part of ralphs lot 	he looked along the righthand logs numbering the hunters that had been a choir 	im going off by myself he can catch his own pigs anyone who wants to hunt when i do can come too 	he blundered out of the triangle toward the drop to the white sand 	jack 	jack turned and looked back at ralph for a moment he paused and then cried out highpitched enraged 	no 	he leapt down from the platform and ran along the beach paying no heed to the steady fall of his tears and until he dived into the forest ralph watched him  	piggy was indignant 	i been talking ralph and you just stood there like 	softly looking at piggy and not seeing him ralph spoke to himself 	hell come back when the sun goes down hell come he looked at the conch in piggys hand 	what 	well there 	piggy gave up the attempt to rebuke ralph he polished his glass again and went back to his subject 	we can do without jack merridew theres others besides him on this island but now we really got a beast though i cant hardly believe it well need to stay close to the platform therell be less need of him and his hunting so now we can really decide on whats what 	theres no help piggy nothing to be done 	for a while they sat in depressed silence then simon stood up and took the conch from piggy who was so astonished that he remained on his feet ralph looked up at simon 	simon what is it this time 	a halfsound of jeering ran round the circle and simon shrank from it 	i thought there might be something to do something we 	again the pressure of the assembly took his voice away he sought for help and sympathy and chose piggy he turned half toward him clutching the conch to his brown chest 	i think we ought to climb the mountain 	the circle shivered with dread simon broke off and turned to piggy who was looking at him with an expression of derisive incomprehension 	whats the good of climbing up to this here beast when ralph and the other two couldnt do nothing 	simon whispered his answer 	what else is there to do 	his speech made he allowed piggy to lift the conch out of his hands then he retired and sat as far away from the others as possible 	piggy was speaking now with more assurance and with what if the circumstances had not been so serious the others would have recognized as pleasure 	i said we could all do without a certain person now i say we got to decide on what can be done and i think i could tell you what ralphs going to say next the most important thing on the island is the smoke and you cant have no smoke without a fire 	ralph made a restless movement 	no go piggy weve got no fire that thing sits up therewell have to stay here 	piggy lifted the conch as though to add power to his next words 	we got no fire on the mountain but whats wrong with a fire down here a fire could be built on them rocks on the sand even wed make smoke just the same 	thats right 	smoke 	by the bathing pool 	the boys began to babble only piggy could have the intellectual daring to suggest moving the fire from the mountain 	so well have the fire down here said ralph he looked about him we can build it just here between the bathing pool and the platform of course 	he broke off frowning thinking the thing out unconsciously tugging at the stub of a nail with his teeth 	of course the smoke wont show so much not be seen so far away but we neednt go near near the 	the others nodded in perfect comprehension there would be no need to go near 	well build the fire now 	the greatest ideas are the simplest now there was something to be done they worked with passion piggy was so full of delight and expanding liberty in jacks departure so full of pride in his contribution to the good of society that he helped to fetch wood the wood he fetched was close at hand a fallen tree on the platform that they did not need for the assembly yet to the others the sanctity of the platform had protected even what was useless there then the twins realized they would have a fire near them as a comfort in the night and this set a few littluns dancing and clapping hands 	the wood was not so dry as the fuel they had used on the mountain much of it was damply rotten and full of insects that scurried logs had to be lifted from the soil with care or they crumbled into sodden powder more than this in order to avoid going deep into the forest the boys worked near at hand on any fallen wood no matter how tangled with new growth the skirts of the forest and the scar were familiar near the conch and the shelters and sufficiently friendly in daylight what they might become in darkness nobody cared to think they worked therefore with great energy and cheerfulness though as time crept by there was a suggestion of panic in the energy and hysteria in the cheerfulness they built a pyramid of leaves and twigs branches and logs on the bare sand by the platform for the first time on the island piggy himself removed his one glass knelt down and focused the sun on tinder soon there was a ceiling of smoke and a bush of yellow flame 	the littluns who had seen few fires since the first catastrophe became wildly excited they danced and sang and there was a partyish air about the gathering 	at last ralph stopped work and stood up smudging the sweat from his face with a dirty forearm 	well have to have a small fire this ones too big to keep up 	piggy sat down carefully on the sand and began to polish his glass 	we could experiment we could find out how to make a small hot fire and then put green branches on to make smoke some of them leaves must be better for that than the others 	as the fire died down so did the excitement the littluns stopped singing and dancing and drifted away toward the sea or the fruit trees or the shelters 	ralph dropped down in the sand 	well have to make a new list of whos to look after the fire 	if you can find em 	he looked round then for the first time he saw how few biguns there were and understood why the work had been so hard 	wheres maurice 	piggy wiped his glass again 	i expect    no he wouldnt go into the forest by himself would he 	ralph jumped up ran swiftly round the fire and stood by piggy holding up his hair 	but weve got to have a list theres you and me and samneric and 	he would not look at piggy but spoke casually 	wheres bill and roger 	piggy leaned forward and put a fragment of wood on the fire 	i expect theyve gone i expect they wont play either 	ralph sat down and began to poke little holes in the sand he was surprised to see that one had a drop of blood by it he examined his bitten nail closely and watched the little globe of blood that gathered where the quick was gnawed away 	piggy went on speaking 	i seen them stealing off when we was gathering wood they went that way the same way as he went himself 	ralph finished his inspection and looked up into the air the sky as if in sympathy with the great changes among them was different today and so misty that in some places the hot air seemed white the disc of the sun was dull silver as though it were nearer and not so hot yet the air stifled 	they always been making trouble havent they 	the voice came near his shoulder and sounded anxious we can do without em well be happier now wont we 	ralph sat the twins came dragging a great log and grinning in their triumph they dumped the log among the embers so that sparks flew 	we can do all right on our own cant we 	for a long time while the log dried caught fire and turned red hot ralph sat in the sand and said nothing he did not see piggy go to the twins and whisper to them nor how the three boys went together into the forest 	here you are 	he came to himself with a jolt piggy and the other two were by him they were laden with fruit 	i thought perhaps said piggy we ought to have a feast kind of 	the three boys sat down they had a great mass of the fruit with them and all of it properly ripe they grinned at ralph as he took some and began to eat 	thanks he said then with an accent of pleased surprisethanks 	do all right on our own said piggy its them that havent no common sense that make trouble on this island well make a little hot fire 	ralph remembered what had been worrying him 	wheres simon 	i dont know 	you dont think hes climbing the mountain 	piggy broke into noisy laughter and took more fruit he might be he gulped his mouthful hes cracked  	simon had passed through the area of fruit trees but today the littluns had been too busy with the fire on the beach and they had not pursued him there he went on among the creepers until he reached the great mat that was woven by the open space and crawled inside beyond the screen of leaves the sunlight pelted down and the butterflies danced in the middle their unending dance he knelt down and the arrow of the sun fell on him that other time the air had seemed to vibrate with heat but now it threatened soon the sweat was running from his long coarse hair he shifted restlessly but there was no avoiding the sun presently he was thirsty and then very thirsty he continued to sit  	far off along the beach jack was standing before a small group of boys he was looking brilliantly happy 	hunting he said he sized them up each of them wore the remains of a black cap and ages ago they had stood in two demure rows and their voices had been the song of angels 	well hunt im going to be chief 	they nodded and the crisis passed easily 	and thenabout the beast 	they moved looked at the forest 	i say this we arent going to bother about the beast 	he nodded at them 	were going to forget the beast 	thats right 	yes 	forget the beast 	if jack was astonished by their fervor he did not show it 	and another thing we shant dream so much down here this is near the end of the island 	they agreed passionately out of the depths of their tormented private lives 	now listen we might go later to the castle rock but now im going to get more of the biguns away from the conch and all that well kill a pig and give a feast he paused and went on more slowly and about the beast when we kill well leave some of the kill for it then it wont bother us maybe 	he stood up abruptly 	well go into the forest now and hunt 	he turned and trotted away and after a moment they followed him obediently 	they spread out nervously in the forest almost at once jack found the dung and scattered roots that told of pig and soon the track was fresh jack signaled the rest of the hunt to be quiet and went forward by himself he was happy and wore the damp darkness of the forest like his old clothes he crept down a slope to rocks and scattered trees by the sea 	the pigs lay bloated bags of fat sensuously enjoying the shadows under the trees there was no wind and they were unsuspicious and practice had made jack silent as the shadows he stole away again and instructed his hidden hunters presently they all began to inch forward sweating in the silence and heat under the trees an ear flapped idly a little apart from the rest sunk in deep maternal bliss lay the largest sow of the lot she was black and pink and the great bladder of her belly was fringed with a row of piglets that slept or burrowed and squeaked 	fifteen yards from the drove jack stopped and his arm straightening pointed at the sow he looked round in inquiry to make sure that everyone understood and the other boys nodded at him the row of right arms slid back 	now 	the drove of pigs started up and at a range of only ten yards the wooden spears with firehardened points flew toward the chosen pig one piglet with a demented shriek rushed into the sea trailing rogers spear behind it the sow gave a gasping squeal and staggered up with two spears sticking in her fat flank the boys shouted and rushed forward the piglets scattered and the sow burst the advancing line and went crashing away through the forest 	after her 	they raced along the pigtrack but the forest was too dark and tangled so that jack cursing stopped them and cast among the trees then he said nothing for a time but breathed fiercely so that they were awed by him and looked at each other in uneasy admiration presently he stabbed down at the ground with his finger 	there 	before the others could examine the drop of blood jack had swerved off judging a trace touching a bough that gave so he followed mysteriously right and assured and the hunters trod behind him 	he stopped before a covert 	in there 	they surrounded the covert but the sow got away with the sting of another spear in her flank the trailing butts hindered her and the sharp crosscut points were a torment she blundered into a tree forcing a spear still deeper and after that any of the hunters could follow her easily by the drops of vivid blood the afternoon wore on hazy and dreadful with damp heat the sow staggered her way ahead of them bleeding and mad and the hunters followed wedded to her in lust excited by the long chase and the dropped blood they could see her now nearly got up with her but she spurted with her last strength and held ahead of them again they were just behind her when she staggered into an open space where bright flowers grew and butterflies danced round each other and the air was hot and still 	here struck down by the heat the sow fell and the hunters hurled themselves at her this dreadful eruption from an unknown world made her frantic she squealed and bucked and the air was full of sweat and noise and blood and terror roger ran round the heap prodding with his spear whenever pigflesh appeared jack was on top of the sow stabbing downward with his knife roger found a lodgment for his point and began to push till he was leaning with his whole weight the spear moved forward inch by inch and the terrified squealing became a highpitched scream then jack found the throat and the hot blood spouted over his hands the sow collapsed under them and they were heavy and fulfilled upon her the butterflies still danced preoccupied in the center of the clearing 	at last the immediacy of the kill subsided the boys drew back and jack stood up holding out his hands 	look 	he giggled and flicked them while the boys laughed at his reeking palms then jack grabbed maurice and rubbed the stuff over his cheeks roger began to withdraw his spear and boys noticed it for the first time robert stabilized the thing in a phrase which was received uproariously 	right up her ass 	did you hear	 	did you hear what he said 	right up her ass 	this time robert and maurice acted the two parts and maurices acting of the pigs efforts to avoid the advancing spear was so funny that the boys cried with laughter 	at length even this palled jack began to clean his bloody hands on the rock then he started work on the sow and paunched her lugging out the hot bags of colored guts pushing them into a pile on the rock while the others watched him he talked as he worked 	well take the meat along the beach ill go back to the platform and invite them to a feast that should give us time 	roger spoke 	chief 	uh 	how can we make a fire 	jack squatted back and frowned at the pig 	well raid them and take fire there must be four of you henry and you robert and maurice well put on paint and sneak up roger can snatch a branch while i say what i want the rest of you can get this back to where we were well build the fire there and after that 	he paused and stood up looking at the shadows under the trees his voice was lower when he spoke again 	but well leave part of the kill for    	he knelt down again and was busy with his knife the boys crowded round him he spoke over his shoulder to roger 	sharpen a stick at both ends 	presently he stood up holding the dripping sows head in his hands 	wheres that stick 	here 	ram one end in the earth ohits rock jam it in that crack there 	jack held up the head and jammed the soft throat down on the pointed end of the stick which pierced through into the mouth he stood back and the head hung there a little blood dribbling down the stick 	instinctively the boys drew back too and the forest was very still they listened and the loudest noise was the buzzing of flies over the spilled guts 	jack spoke in a whisper 	pick up the pig 	maurice and robert skewered the carcass lifted the dead weight and stood ready in the silence and standing over the dry blood they looked suddenly furtive 	jack spoke loudly 	this head is for the beast its a gift 	the silence accepted the gift and awed them the head remained there dimeyed grinning faintly blood blackening between the teeth all at once they were running away as fast as they could through the forest toward the open beach  	simon stayed where he was a small brown image concealed by the leaves even if he shut his eyes the sows head still remained like an afterimage the halfshut eyes were dim with the infinite cynicism of adult life they assured simon that everything was a bad business 	i know that 	simon discovered that he had spoken aloud he opened his eyes quickly and there was the head grinning amusedly in the strange daylight ignoring the flies the spilled guts even ignoring the indignity of being spiked on a stick 	he looked away licking his dry lips 	a gift for the beast might not the beast come for it the head he thought appeared to agree with him run away said the head silently go back to the others it was a joke reallywhy should you bother you were just wrong thats all a little headache something you ate perhaps go back child said the head silently 	simon looked up feeling the weight of his wet hair and gazed at the sky up there for once were clouds great bulging towers that sprouted away over the island grey and cream and coppercolored the clouds were sitting on the land they squeezed produced moment by moment this close tormenting heat even the butterflies deserted the open space where the obscene thing grinned and dripped simon lowered his head carefully keeping his eyes shut then sheltered them with his hand there were no shadows under the trees but everywhere a pearly stillness so that what was real seemed illusive and without definition the pile of guts was a black blob of flies that buzzed like a saw after a while these flies found simon gorged they alighted by his runnels of sweat and drank they tickled under his nostrils and played leapfrog on his thighs they were black and iridescent green and without number and in front of simon the lord of the flies hung on his stick and grinned at last simon gave up and looked back saw the white teeth and dim eyes the bloodand his gaze was held by that ancient inescapable recognition in simons right temple a pulse began to beat on the brain  	ralph and piggy lay in the sand gazing at the fire and idly flicking pebbles into its smokeless heart 	that branch is gone 	wheres samneric 	we ought to get some more wood were out of green branches 	ralph sighed and stood up there were no shadows under the palms on the platform only this strange light that seemed to come from everywhere at once high up among the bulging clouds thunder went off like a gun 	were going to get buckets of rain 	what about the fire 	ralph trotted into the forest and returned with a wide spray of green which he dumped on the fire the branch crackled the leaves curled and the yellow smoke expanded 	piggy made an aimless little pattern in the sand with his fingers 	trouble is we havent got enough people for a fire you got to treat samnenc as one turn they do everything together 	of course 	well that isnt fair dont you see they ought to do two turns 	ralph considered this and understood he was vexed to find how little he thought like a grownup and sighed again the island was getting worse and worse 	piggy looked at the fire 	youll want another green branch soon 	ralph rolled over 	piggy what are we going to do 	just have to get on without em 	butthe fire 	he frowned at the black and white mess in which lay the unburnt ends of branches he tried to formulate 	im scared 	he saw piggy look up and blundered on 	not of the beast i mean im scared of that too but nobody else understands about the fire if someone threw you a rope when you were drowning if a doctor said take this because if you dont take it youll dieyou would wouldnt you i mean 	course i would 	cant they see cant they understand without the smoke signal well die here look at that 	a wave of heated air trembled above the ashes but without a trace of smoke 	we cant keep one fire going and they dont care and whats more he looked intensely into piggys streaming face 	whats more i dont sometimes supposing i got like the othersnot caring what ud become of us 	piggy took off his glasses deeply troubled 	i dunno ralph we just got to go on thats all thats what grownups would do 	ralph having begun the business of unburdening himself continued 	piggy whats wrong 	piggy looked at him in astonishment 	do you mean the 	no not it    i mean    what makes things break up like they do 	piggy rubbed his glasses slowly and thought when he understood how far ralph had gone toward accepting him he flushed pinkly with pride 	i dunno ralph i expect its him 	jack 	jack a taboo was evolving round that word too 	ralph nodded solemnly 	yes he said i suppose it must be 	the forest near them burst into uproar demoniac figures with faces of white and red and green rushed out howling so that the littluns fled screaming out of the corner of his eye ralph saw piggy running two figures rushed at the fire and he prepared to defend himself but they grabbed halfburnt branches and raced away along the beach the three others stood still watching ralph and he saw that the tallest of them stark naked save for paint and a belt was jack 	ralph had his breath back and spoke 	well 	jack ignored him lifted his spear and began to shout 	listen all of you me and my hunters were living along the beach by a flat rock we hunt and feast and have fun if you want to join my tribe come and see us perhaps ill let you join perhaps not 	he paused and looked round he was safe from shame or selfconsciousness behind the mask of his paint and could look at each of them in turn ralph was kneeling by the remains of the fire like a sprinter at his mark and his face was halfhidden by hair and smut samneric peered together round a palm tree at the edge of the forest a littlun howled creased and crimson by the bathing pool and piggy stood on the platform the white conch gripped in his hands 	tonight were having a feast weve killed a pig and weve got meat you can come and eat with us if you like 	up in the cloud canyons the thunder boomed again jack and the two anonymous savages with him swayed looking up and then recovered the littlun went on howling jack was waiting for something he whispered urgently to the others 	go onnow 	the two savages murmured jack spoke sharply 	go on 	the two savages looked at each other raised their spears together and spoke in time 	the chief has spoken 	then the three of them turned and trotted away presently ralph rose to his feet looking at the place where the savages had vanished samneric came talking in an awed whisper 	i thought it was 	and i was 	scared 	piggy stood above them on the platform still holding the conch 	that was jack and maurice and robert said ralph arent they having fun 	i thought i was going to have asthma 	sucks to your assmar 	when i saw jack i was sure hed go for the conch cant think why 	the group of boys looked at the white shell with affectionate respect piggy placed it in ralphs hand and the littluns seeing the familiar symbol started to come back 	not here 	he turned toward the platform feeling the need for ritual first went ralph the white conch cradled then piggy very grave then the twins then the littluns and the others 	sit down all of you they raided us for fire theyre having fun but the 	ralph was puzzled by the shutter that flickered in his brain there was something he wanted to say then the shutter had come down 	but the 	they were regarding him gravely not yet troubled by any doubts about his sufficiency ralph pushed the idiot hair out of his eyes and looked at piggy 	but the    oh    the fire of course the fire 	he started to laugh then stopped and became fluent instead 	the fires the most important thing without the fire we cant be rescued id like to put on warpaint and be a savage but we must keep the fire burning the fires the most important thing on the island because because 	he paused again and the silence became full of doubt and wonder 	piggy whispered urgently rescue 	oh yes without the fire we cant be rescued so we must stay by the fire and make smoke 	when he stopped no one said anything after the many brilliant speeches that had been made on this very spot ralphs remarks seemed lame even to the littluns 	at last bill held out his hands for the conch  	now we cant have the fire up therebecause we cant have the fire up therewe need more people to keep it going lets go to this feast and tell them the fires hard on the rest of us and the hunting and all that being savages i meanit must be jolly good fun 	samneric took the conch 	that must be fun like bill saysand as hes invited us 	to a feast 	meat 	crackling 	i could do with some meat 	ralph held up his hand 	why shouldnt we get our own meat 	the twins looked at each other bill answered 	we dont want to go in the jungle 	ralph grimaced 	heyou knowgoes 	hes a hunter theyre all hunters thats different 	no one spoke for a moment then piggy muttered to the sand 	meat 	the littluns sat solemnly thinking of meat and dribbling overhead the cannon boomed again and the dry palm fronds clattered in a sudden gust of hot wind  	you are a silly little boy said the lord of the flies just an ignorant silly little boy 	simon moved his swollen tongue but said nothing 	dont you agree said the lord of the flies arent you just a silly little boy 	simon answered him in the same silent voice 	well then said the lord of the flies youd better run off and play with the others they think youre batty you dont want ralph to think youre batty do you you like ralph a lot dont you and piggy and jack 	simons head was tilted slightly up his eyes could not break away and the lord of the flies hung in space before him 	what are you doing out here all alone arent you afraid of me 	simon shook 	there isnt anyone to help you only me and im the beast 	simons mouth labored brought forth audible words 	pigs head on a stick 	fancy thinking the beast was something you could hunt and kill said the head for a moment or two the forest and all the other dimly appreciated places echoed with the parody of laughter you knew didnt you im part of you close close close im the reason why its no go why things are what they are 	the laughter shivered again 	come now said the lord of the flies get back to the others and well forget the whole thing 	simons head wobbled his eyes were half closed as though he were imitating the obscene thing on the stick he knew that one of his times was coming on the lord of the flies was expanding like a balloon 	this is ridiculous you know perfectly well youll only meet me down thereso dont try to escape 	simons body was arched and stiff the lord of the flies spoke in the voice of a schoolmaster 	this has gone quite far enough my poor misguided child do you think you know better than i do 	there was a pause 	im warning you im going to get angry dyou see youre not wanted understand we are going to have fun on this island understand we are going to have fun on this island so dont try it on my poor misguided boy or else 	simon found he was looking into a vast mouth there was blackness within a blackness that spread 	or else said the lord of the flies we shall do you see jack and roger and maurice and robert and bill and piggy and ralph do you see 	simon was inside the mouth he fell down and lost consciousness   chapter nine  a view to a death  	over the island the buildup of clouds continued a steady current of heated air rose all day from the mountain and was thrust to ten thousand feet revolving masses of gas piled up the static until the air was ready to explode by early evening the sun had gone and a brassy glare had taken the place of clear daylight even the air that pushed in from the sea was hot and held no refreshment colors drained from water and trees and pink surfaces of rock and the white and brown clouds brooded nothing prospered but the flies who blackened their lord and made the spilt guts look like a heap of glistening coal even when the vessel broke in simons nose and the blood gushed out they left him alone preferring the pigs high flavor 	with the running of the blood simons fit passed into the weariness of sleep he lay in the mat of creepers while the evening advanced and the cannon continued to play at last he woke and saw dimly the dark earth close by his cheek still he did not move but lay there his face sideways on the earth his eyes looking dully before him then he turned over drew his feet under him and laid hold of the creepers to pull himself up when the creepers shook the flies exploded from the guts with a vicious note and clamped back on again simon got to his feet the light was unearthly the lord of the flies hung on his stick like a black ball 	simon spoke aloud to the clearing 	what else is there to do 	nothing replied simon turned away from the open space and crawled through the creepers till he was in the dusk of the forest he walked drearily between the trunks his face empty of expression and the blood was dry round his mouth and chin only sometimes as he lifted the ropes of creeper aside and chose his direction from the trend of the land he mouthed words that did not reach the air 	presently the creepers festooned the trees less frequently and there was a scatter of pearly light from the sky down through the trees this was the backbone of the island the slightly higher land that lay beneath the mountain where the forest was no longer deep jungle here there were wide spaces interspersed with thickets and huge trees and the trend of the ground led him up as the forest opened he pushed on staggering sometimes with his weariness but never stopping the usual brightness was gone from his eyes and he walked with a sort of glum determination like an old man 	a buffet of wind made him stagger and he saw that he was out in the open on rock under a brassy sky he found his legs were weak and his tongue gave him pain all the time when the wind reached the mountaintop he could see something happen a flicker of blue stuff against brown clouds he pushed himself forward and the wind came again stronger now cuffing the forest heads till they ducked and roared simon saw a humped thing suddenly sit up on the top and look down at him he hid his face and toiled on 	the flies had found the figure too the lifelike movement would scare them off for a moment so that they made a dark cloud round the head then as the blue material of the parachute collapsed the corpulent figure would bow forward sighing and the flies settle once more 	simon felt his knees smack the rock he crawled forward and soon he understood the tangle of lines showed him the mechanics of this parody he examined the white nasal bones the teeth the colors of corruption he saw how pitilessly the layers of rubber and canvas held together the poor body that should be rotting away then the wind blew again and the figure lifted bowed and breathed foully at him simon knelt on all fours and was sick till his stomach was empty then he took the lines in his hands he freed them from the rocks and the figure from the winds indignity 	at last he turned away and looked down at the beaches the fire by the platform appeared to be out or at least making no smoke further along the beach beyond the little river and near a great slab of rock a thin trickle of smoke was climbing into the sky simon forgetful of the flies shaded his eyes with both hands and peered at the smoke even at that distance it was possible to see that most of the boysperhaps all of the boyswere there so they had shifted camp then away from the beast as simon thought this he turned to the poor broken thing that sat stinking by his side the beast was harmless and horrible and the news must reach the others as soon as possible he started down the mountain and his legs gave beneath him even with great care the best he could do was a stagger  	bathing said ralph thats the only thing to do piggy was inspecting the loomingsky through his glass i dont like them clouds remember how it rained just after we landed 	going to rain again 	ralph dived into the pool a couple of littluns were playing at the edge trying to extract comfort from a wetness warmer than blood piggy took off his glasses stepped primly into the water and then put them on again ralph came to the surface and squirted a jet of water at him 	mind my specs said piggy if i get water on the glass i got to get out and clean em 	ralph squirted again and missed he laughed at piggy expecting him to retire meekly as usual and in pained silence instead piggy beat the water with his hands 	stop it he shouted dyou hear 	furiously he drove the water into ralphs face 	all right all right said ralph keep your hair on 	piggy stopped beating the water 	i got a pain in my head i wish the air was cooler 	i wish the rain would come  	i wish we could go home 	piggy lay back against the sloping sand side of the pool his stomach protruded and the water dried on it ralph squinted up at the sky one could guess at the movement of the sun by the progress of a light patch among the clouds he knelt in the water and looked round 	wheres everybody 	piggy sat up 	praps theyre lying in the shelter 	wheres samneric 	and bill 	piggy pointed beyond the platform 	thats where theyve gone jacks party 	let them go said ralph uneasily i dont care 	just for some meat 	and for hunting said ralph wisely and for pretending to be a tribe and putting on warpaint 	piggy stirred the sand under water and did not look at ralph 	praps we ought to go too 	ralph looked at him quickly and piggy blushed 	i meanto make sure nothing happens 	ralph squirted water again  	long before ralph and piggy came up with jacks lot they could hear the party there was a stretch of grass in a place where the palms left a wide band of turf between the forest and the shore just one step down from the edge of the turf was the white blown sand of above high water warm dry trodden below that again was a rock that stretched away toward the lagoon beyond was a short stretch of sand and then the edge of the water a fire burned on the rock and fat dripped from the roasting pigmeat into the invisible flames all the boys of the island except piggy ralph simon and the two tending the pig were grouped on the turf they were laughing singing lying squatting or standing on the grass holding food in their hands but to judge by the greasy faces the meat eating was almost done and some held coconut shells in their hands and were drinking from them before the party had started a great log had been dragged into the center of the lawn and jack painted and garlanded sat there like an idol there were piles of meat on green leaves near him and fruit and coconut shells full of drink 	piggy and ralph came to the edge of the grassy platform and the boys as they noticed them fell silent one by one till only the boy next to jack was talking then the silence intruded even there and jack turned where he sat for a time he looked at them and the crackle of the fire was the loudest noise over the droning of the reef ralph looked away and sam thinking that ralph had turned to him accusingly put down his gnawed bone with a nervous giggle ralph took an uncertain step pointed to a palm tree and whispered something inaudible to piggy and they both giggled like sam lifting his feet high out of the sand ralph started to stroll past piggy tried to whistle 	at this moment the boys who were cooking at the fire suddenly hauled off a great chunk of meat and ran with it toward the grass they bumped piggy who was burnt and yelled and danced immediately ralph and the crowd of boys were united and relieved by a storm of laughter piggy once more was the center of social derision so that everyone felt cheerful and normal 	jack stood up and waved his spear 	take them some meat 	the boys with the spit gave ralph and piggy each a succulent chunk they took the gift dribbling so they stood and ate beneath a sky of thunderous brass that rang with the stormcoming 	jack waved his spear again 	has everybody eaten as much as they want 	there was still food left sizzling on the wooden spits heaped on the green platters betrayed by his stomach piggy threw a picked bone down on the beach and stooped for more 	jack spoke again impatiently 	has everybody eaten as much as they want 	his tone conveyed a warning given out of the pride of ownership and the boys ate faster while there was still time seeing there was no immediate likelihood of a pause jack rose from the log that was his throne and sauntered to the edge of the grass he looked down from behind his paint at ralph and piggy they moved a little farther off over the sand and ralph watched the fire as he ate he noticed without understanding how the flames were visible now against the dull light evening was come not with calm beauty but with the threat of violence 	jack spoke 	give me a drink 	henry brought him a shell and he drank watching piggy and ralph over the jagged rim power lay in the brown swell of his forearms authority sat on his shoulder and chattered in his ear like an ape  	all sit down 	the boys ranged themselves in rows on the grass before him but ralph and piggy stayed a foot lower standing on the soft sand jack ignored them for the moment turned his mask down to the seated boys and pointed at them with the spear 	whos going to join my tribe 	ralph made a sudden movement that became a stumble some of the boys turned toward him 	i gave you food said jack and my hunters will protect you from the beast who will join my tribe 	im chief said ralph because you chose me and we were going to keep the fire going now you run after food 	you ran yourself shouted jack look at that bone in your hands 	ralph went crimson 	i said you were hunters that was your job 	jack ignored him again 	wholl join my tribe and have fun 	im chief said ralph tremulously and what about the fire and ive got the conch 	you havent got it with you said jack sneering you left it behind see clever and the conch doesnt count at this end of the island 	all at once the thunder struck instead of the dull boom there was a point of impact in the explosion 	the conch counts here too said ralph and all over the island 	what are you going to do about it then 	ralph examined the ranks of boys there was no help in them and he looked away confused and sweating piggy whispered 	the firerescue 	wholl join my tribe 	i will 	me 	i will 	ill blow the conch said ralph breathlessly and call an assembly 	we shant hear it  	piggy touched ralphs wrist 	come away theres going to be trouble and weve had our meat 	there was a blink of bright light beyond the forest and the thunder exploded again so that a littlun started to whine big drops of rain fell among them making individual sounds when they struck 	going to be a storm said ralph and youll have rain like when we dropped here whos clever now where are your shelters what are you going to do about that 	the hunters were looking uneasily at the sky flinching from the stroke of the drops a wave of restlessness set the boys swaying and moving aimlessly the flickering light became brighter and the blows of the thunder were only just bearable the littluns began to run about screaming 	jack leapt on to the sand 	do our dance come on dance 	he ran stumbling through the thick sand to the open space of rock beyond the fire between the flashes of lightning the air was dark and terrible and the boys followed him clamorously roger became the pig grunting and charging at jack who sidestepped the hunters took their spears the cooks took spits and the rest clubs of firewood a circling movement developed and a chant while roger mimed the terror of the pig the littluns ran and jumped on the outside of the circle piggy and ralph under the threat of the sky found themselves eager to take a place in this demented but partly secure society they were glad to touch the brown backs of the fence that hemmed in the terror and made it governable 	kill the beast cut his throat spill his blood 	the movement became regular while the chant lost its first superficial excitement and began to beat like a steady pulse roger ceased to be a pig and became a hunter so that the center of the ring yawned emptily some of the littluns started a ring on their own and the complementary circles went round and round as though repetition would achieve safety of itself there was the throb and stamp of a single organism 	the dark sky was shattered by a bluewhite scar an instant later the noise was on them like the blow of a gigantic whip the chant rose a tone in agony 	kill the beast cut his throat spill his blood 	now out of the terror rose another desire thick urgent blind 	kill the beast cut his throat spill his blood 	again the bluewhite scar jagged above them and the sulphurous explosion beat down the littluns screamed and blundered about fleeing from the edge of the forest and one of them broke the ring of biguns in his terror 	him him 	the circle became a horseshoe a thing was crawling out of the forest it came darkly uncertainly the shrill screaming that rose before the beast was like a pain the beast stumbled into the horseshoe 	kill the beast cut his throat spill his blood 	the bluewhite scar was constant the noise unendurable simon was crying out something about a dead man on a hill 	kill the beast cut his throat spill his blood do him in 	the sticks fell and the mouth of the new circle crunched and screamed the beast was on its knees in the center its arms folded over its face it was crying out against the abominable noise something about a body on the hill the beast struggled forward broke the ring and fell over the steep edge of the rock to the sand by the water at once the crowd surged after it poured down the rock leapt on to the beast screamed struck bit tore there were no words and no movements but the tearing of teeth and claws 	then the clouds opened and let down the rain like a waterfall the water bounded from the mountaintop tore leaves and branches from the trees poured like a cold shower over the struggling heap on the sand presently the heap broke up and figures staggered away only the beast lay still a few yards from the sea even in the rain they could see how small a beast it was and already its blood was staining the sand 	now a great wind blew the rain sideways cascading the water from the forest trees on the mountaintop the parachute filled and moved the figure slid rose to its feet spun swayed down through a vastness of wet air and trod with ungainly feet the tops of the high trees falling still falling it sank toward the beach and the boys rushed screaming into the darkness the parachute took the figure forward furrowing the lagoon and bumped it over the reef and out to sea  	toward midnight the rain ceased and the clouds drifted away so that the sky was scattered once more with the incredible lamps of stars then the breeze died too and there was no noise save the drip and trickle of water that ran out of clefts and spilled down leaf by leaf to the brown earth of the island the air was cool moist and clear and presently even the sound of the water was still the beast lay huddled on the pale beach and the stains spread inch by inch 	the edge of the lagoon became a streak of phosphorescence which advanced minutely as the great wave of the tide flowed the clear water mirrored the clear sky and the angular bright constellations the line of phosphorescence bulged about the sand grains and little pebbles it held them each in a dimple of tension then suddenly accepted them with an inaudible syllable and moved on 	along the shoreward edge of the shallows the advancing clearness was full of strange moonbeambodied creatures with fiery eyes here and there a larger pebble clung to its own air and was covered with a coat of pearls the tide swelled in over the rainpitted sand and smoothed everything with a layer of silver now it touched the first of the stains that seeped from the broken body and the creatures made a moving patch of light as they gathered at the edge the water rose farther and dressed simons coarse hair with brightness the line of his cheek silvered and the turn of his shoulder became sculptured marble the strange attendant creatures with their fiery eyes and trailing vapors busied themselves round his head the body lifted a fraction of an inch from the sand and a bubble of air escaped from the mouth with a wet plop then it turned gently in the water 	somewhere over the darkened curve of the world the sun and moon were pulling and the film of water on the earth planet was held bulging slightly on one side while the solid core turned the great wave of the tide moved farther along the island and the water lifted softly surrounded by a fringe of inquisitive bright creatures itself a silver shape beneath the steadfast constellations simons dead body moved out toward the open sea   chapter ten  the shell and the glasses  	piggy eyed the advancing figure carefully nowadays he sometimes found that he saw more clearly if he removed his glasses and shifted the one lens to the other eye but even through the good eye after what had happened ralph remained unmistakably ralph he came now out of the coconut trees limping dirty with dead leaves hanging from his shock of yellow hair one eye was a slit in his puffy cheek and a great scab had formed on his right knee he paused for a moment and peered at the figure on the platform 	piggy are you the only one left 	theres some littluns 	they dont count no biguns 	ohsamneric theyre collecting wood 	nobody else 	not that i know of 	ralph climbed on to the platform carefully the coarse grass was still worn away where the assembly used to sit the fragile white conch still gleamed by the polished seat ralph sat down in the grass facing the chiefs seat and the conch piggy knelt at his left and for a long minute there was silence 	at last ralph cleared his throat and whispered something 	piggy whispered back 	what you say 	ralph spoke up 	simon 	piggy said nothing but nodded solemnly they continued to sit gazing with impaired sight at the chiefs seat and the glittering lagoon the green light and the glossy patches of sunshine played over their befouled bodies 	at length ralph got up and went to the conch he took the shell caressingly with both hands and knelt leaning against the trunk 	piggy 	uh 	what we going to do 	piggy nodded at the conch 	you could 	call an assembly 	ralph laughed sharply as he said the word and piggy frowned 	youre still chief 	ralph laughed again 	you are over us 	i got the conch 	ralph stop laughing like that look there aint no need ralph whats the others going to think 	at last ralph stopped he was shivering 	piggy  	uh 	that was simon 	you said that before 	piggy 	uh 	that was murder 	you stop it said piggy shrilly what goodre you doing talking like that 	he jumped to his feet and stood over ralph 	it was dark there was thatthat bloody dance there was lightning and thunder and rain we was scared 	i wasnt scared said ralph slowly i wasi dont know what i was 	we was scared said piggy excitedly anything might have happened it wasntwhat you said 	he was gesticulating searching for a formula 	oh piggy 	ralphs voice low and stricken stopped piggys gestures he bent down and waited ralph cradling the conch rocked himself to and fro 	dont you understand piggy the things we did 	he may still be 	no 	praps he was only pretending 	piggys voice trailed off at the sight of ralphs face 	you were outside outside the circle you never really came in didnt you see what wewhat they did 	there was loathing and at the same time a kind of feverish excitement in his voice 	didnt you see piggy 	not all that well i only got one eye now you ought to know that ralph  	ralph continued to rock to and fro 	it was an accident said piggy suddenly thats what it was an accident his voice shrilled again coming in the darkhe hadnt no business crawling like that out of the dark he was batty he asked for it he gesticulated widely again it was an accident 	you didnt see what they did 	look ralph we got to forget this we cant do no good thinking about it see  	im frightened of us i want to go home oh god i want to go home 	it was an accident said piggy stubbornly and thats that  	he touched ralphs bare shoulder and ralph shuddered at the human contact 	and look ralphpiggy glanced round quickly then leaned closedont let on we was in that dance not to samneric 	but we were all of us 	piggy shook his head 	not us till last they never noticed in the dark anyway you said i was only on the outside 	so was i muttered ralph i was on the outside too 	piggy nodded eagerly 	thats right we was on the outside we never done nothing we never seen nothing 	piggy paused then went on 	well live on our own the four of us 	four of us we arent enough to keep the fire burning 	well try see i lit it 	samneric came dragging a great log out of the forest they dumped it by the fire and turned to the pool ralph jumped to his feet 	hi you two 	the twins checked a moment then walked on 	theyre going to bathe ralph 	better get it over 	the twins were very surprised to see ralph they flushed and looked past him into the air 	hullo fancy meeting you ralph 	we just been in the forest 	to get wood for the fire 	we got lost last night 	ralph examined his toes 	you got lost after the    	piggy cleaned his lens 	after the feast said sam in a stifled voice eric nodded yes after the feast 	we left early said piggy quickly because we were tired 	so did we 	very early 	we were very tired 	sam touched a scratch on his forehead and then hurriedly took his hand away eric fingered his split lip 	yes we were very tired repeated sam so we left early was it a good 	the air was heavy with unspoken knowledge sam twisted and the obscene word shot out of him dance 	memory of the dance that none of them had attended shook all four boys convulsively 	we left early  	when roger came to the neck of land that joined the castle rock to the mainland he was not surprised to be challenged he had reckoned during the terrible night on finding at least some of the tribe holding out against the horrors of the island in the safest place 	the voice rang out sharply from on high where the diminishing crags were balanced one on another 	halt who goes there 	roger 	advance friend 	roger advanced 	you could see who i was 	the chief said we got to challenge everyone 	roger peered up 	you couldnt stop me coming if i wanted 	couldnt i climb up and see 	roger clambered up the ladderlike cliff 	look at this 	a log had been jammed under the topmost rock and another lever under that robert leaned lightly on the lever and the rock groaned a full effort would send the rock thundering down to the neck of land roger admired 	hes a proper chief isnt he 	robert nodded 	hes going to take us hunting 	he jerked his head in the direction of the distant shelters where a thread of white smoke climbed up the sky roger sitting on the very edge of the cliff looked somberly back at the island as he worked with his fingers at a loose tooth his gaze settled on the top of the distant mountain and robert changed the unspoken subject 	hes going to beat wilfred 	what for 	robert shook his head doubtfully 	i dont know he didnt say he got angry and made us tie wilfred up hes beenhe giggled excitedlyhes been tied for hours waiting 	but didnt the chief say why 	i never heard him 	sitting on the tremendous rock in the torrid sun roger received this news as an illumination he ceased to work at his tooth and sat still assimilating the possibilities of irresponsible authority then without another word he climbed down the back of the rocks toward the cave and the rest of the tribe 	the chief was sitting there naked to the waist his face blocked out in white and red the tribe lay in a semicircle before him the newly beaten and untied wilfred was sniffing noisily in the background roger squatted with the rest 	tomorrow went on the chief we shall hunt again 	he pointed at this savage and that with his spear 	some of you will stay here to improve the cave and defend the gate i shall take a few hunters with me and bring back meat the defenders of the gate will see that the others dont sneak in 	a savage raised his hand and the chief turned a bleak painted face toward him 	why should they try to sneak in chief 	the chief was vague but earnest 	they will theyll try to spoil things we do so the watchers at the gate must be careful and then 	the chief paused they saw a triangle of startling pink dart out pass along his lips and vanish again 	and then the beast might try to come in you remember how he crawled 	the semicircle shuddered and muttered in agreement 	he camedisguised he may come again even though we gave him the head of our kill to eat so watch and be careful 	stanley lifted his forearm off the rock and held up an interrogative finger 	well 	but didnt we didnt we 	he squirmed and looked down 	no 	in the silence that followed each savage flinched away from his individual memory 	no how could wekillit 	halfrelieved halfdaunted by the implication of further terrors the savages murmured again 	so leave the mountain alone said the chief solemnly and give it the head if you go hunting 	stanley flicked his finger again 	i expect the beast disguised itself 	perhaps said the chief a theological speculation presented itself wed better keep on the right side of him anyhow you cant tell what he might do 	the tribe considered this and then were shaken as if by a flow of wind the chief saw the effect of his words and stood abruptly 	but tomorrow well hunt and when weve got meat well have a feast 	bill put up his hand 	chief 	yes 	whatll we use for lighting the fire 	the chiefs blush was hidden by the white and red clay into his uncertain silence the tribe spilled their murmur once more then the chief held up his hand 	we shall take fire from the others listen tomorrow well hunt and get meat tonight ill go along with two hunterswholl come 	maurice and roger put up their hands 	maurice 	yes chief 	where was their fire 	back at the old place by the fire rock 	the chief nodded 	the rest of you can go to sleep as soon as the sun sets but us three maurice roger and me weve got work to do well leave just before sunset 	maurice put up his hand 	but what happens if we meet	 	the chief waved his objection aside 	well keep along by the sands then if he comes well do our our dance again 	only the three of us 	again the murmur swelled and died away  	piggy handed ralph his glasses and waited to receive back his sight the wood was damp and this was the third time they had lighted it ralph stood back speaking to himself 	we dont want another night without fire 	he looked round guiltily at the three boys standing by this was the first time he had admitted the double function of the fire certainly one was to send up a beckoning column of smoke but the other was to be a hearth now and a comfort until they slept eric breathed on the wood till it glowed and sent out a little flame a billow of white and yellow smoke reeked up piggy took back his glasses and looked at the smoke with pleasure 	if only we could make a radio 	or a plane 	or a boat 	ralph dredged in his fading knowledge of the world 	we might get taken prisoner by the reds 	eric pushed back his hair 	theyd be better than 	he would not name people and sam finished the sentence for him by nodding along the beach 	ralph remembered the ungainly figure on a parachute 	he said something about a dead man he flushed painfully at this admission that he had been present at the dance he made urging motions at the smoke and with his body dont stopgo on up 	smokes getting thinner 	we need more wood already even when its wet 	my asthma 	the response was mechanical 	sucks to your assmar 	if i pull logs i get my asthma bad i wish i didnt ralph but there it is 	the three boys went into the forest and fetched armfuls of rotten wood once more the smoke rose yellow and thick 	lets get something to eat 	together they went to the fruit trees carrying their spears saying little cramming in haste when they came out of the forest again the sun was setting and only embers glowed in the fire and there was no smoke 	i cant carry any more wood said eric im tired 	ralph cleared his throat	 	we kept the fire going up there 	up there it was small but this has got to be a big one 	ralph carried a fragment to the fire and watched the smoke that drifted into the dusk 	weve got to keep it going 	eric flung himself down 	im too tired and whats the good 	eric cried ralph in a shocked voice dont talk like that 	sam knelt by eric 	wellwhat is the good 	ralph tried indignantly to remember there was something good about a fire something overwhelmingly good 	ralphs told you often enough said piggy moodily how else are we going to be rescued 	of course if we dont make smoke 	he squatted before them in the crowding dusk 	dont you understand whats the good of wishing for radios and boats 	he held out his hand and twisted the fingers into a fist theres only one thing we can do to get out of this mess anyone can play at hunting anyone can get us meat 	he looked from face to face then at the moment of greatest passion and conviction that curtain flapped in his head and he forgot what he had been driving at he knelt there his fist clenched gazing solemnly from one to the other then the curtain whisked back 	oh yes so weve got to make smoke and more smoke 	but we cant keep it going look at that 	the fire was dying on them 	two to mind the fire said ralph half to himself thats twelve hours a day 	we cant get any more wood ralph 	not in the dark 	not at night 	we can light it every morning said piggy nobody aint going to see smoke in the dark 	sam nodded vigorously 	it was different when the fire was 	up there 	ralph stood up feeling curiously defenseless with the darkness pressing in 	let the fire go then for tonight 	he led the way to the first shelter which still stood though battered the bed leaves lay within dry and noisy to the touch in the next shelter a littlun was talking in his sleep the four biguns crept into the shelter and burrowed under the leaves the twins lay together and ralph and piggy at the other end for a while there was the continual creak and rustle of leaves as they tried for comfort 	piggy 	yeah 	all right 	spose so 	at length save for an occasional rustle the shelter was silent an oblong of blackness relieved with brilliant spangles hung before them and there was the hollow sound of surf on the reef ralph settled himself for his nightly game of supposing    	supposing they could be transported home by jet then before morning they would land at that big airfield in wiltshire they would go by car no for things to be perfect they would go by train all the way down to devon and take that cottage again then at the foot of the garden the wild ponies would come and look over the wall    	ralph turned restlessly in the leaves dartmoor was wild and so were the ponies but the attraction of wildness had gone  	his mind skated to a consideration of a tamed town where savagery could not set foot what could be safer than the bus center with its lamps and wheels 	all at once ralph was dancing round a lamp standard there was a bus crawling out of the bus station a strange bus    	ralph ralph 	what is it 	dont make a noise like that 	sorry 	from the darkness of the further end of the shelter came a dreadful moaning and they shattered the leaves in their fear sam and eric locked in an embrace were fighting each other 	sam sam 	heyeric 	presently all was quiet again 	piggy spoke softly to ralph 	we got to get out of this 	what dyou mean 	get rescued 	for the first time that day and despite the crowding blackness ralph sniggered 	i mean it whispered piggy if we dont get home soon well be barmy 	round the bend 	bomb happy	 	crackers 	ralph pushed the damp tendrils of hair out of his eyes 	you write a letter to your auntie 	piggy considered this solemnly 	i dont know where she is now and i havent got an envelope and a stamp an there isnt a mailbox or a postman 	the success of his tiny joke overcame ralph his sniggers became uncontrollable his body jumped and twitched 	piggy rebuked him with dignity 	i havent said anything all that funny 	ralph continued to snigger though his chest hurt his twitchings exhausted him till he lay breathless and woebegone waiting for the next spasm during one of these pauses he was ambushed by sleep 	ralph you been making a noise again do be quiet ralphbecause 	ralph heaved over among the leaves he had reason to be thankful that his dream was broken for the bus had been nearer and more distinct 	whybecause 	be quietand listen 	ralph lay down carefully to the accompaniment of a long sigh from the leaves eric moaned something and then lay still the darkness save for the useless oblong of stars was blanketthick 	i cant hear anything 	theres something moving outside 	ralphs head prickled the sound of his blood drowned all else and then subsided 	i still cant hear anything 	listen listen for a long time 	quite clearly and emphatically and only a yard or so away from the back of the shelter a stick cracked the blood roared again in ralphs ears confused images chased each other through his mind a composite of these things was prowling round the shelters he could feel piggys head against his shoulder and the convulsive grip of a hand 	ralph ralph 	shut up and listen 	desperately ralph prayed that the beast would prefer littluns 	a voice whispered horribly outside 	piggypiggy 	its come gasped piggy its real 	he clung to ralph and reached to get his breath 	piggy come outside i want you piggy 	ralphs mouth was against piggys ear 	dont say anything 	piggywhere are you piggy 	something brushed against the back of the shelter piggy kept still for a moment then he had his asthma he arched his back and crashed among the leaves with his legs ralph rolled away from him 	then there was a vicious snarling in the mouth of the shelter and the plunge and thump of living things someone tripped over ralph and piggys corner became a complication of snarls and crashes and flying limbs ralph hit out then he and what seemed like a dozen others were rolling over and over hitting biting scratching he was torn and jolted found fingers in his mouth and bit them a fist withdrew and came back like a piston so that the whole shelter exploded into light ralph twisted sideways on top of a writhing body and felt hot breath on his cheek he began to pound the mouth below him using his clenched fist as a hammer he hit with more and more passionate hysteria as the face became slippery a knee jerked up between his legs and he fell sideways busying himself with his pain and the fight rolled over him then the shelter collapsed with smothering finality and the anonymous shapes fought their way out and through dark figures drew themselves out of the wreckage and flitted away till the screams of the littluns and piggys gasps were once more audible 	ralph called out in a quavering voice 	all you littluns go to sleep weve had a fight with the others now go to sleep 	samneric came close and peered at ralph 	are you two all right 	i think so 	i got busted 	so did i hows piggy 	they hauled piggy clear of the wreckage and leaned him against a tree the night was cool and purged of immediate terror piggys breathing was a little easier 	did you get hurt piggy 	not much 	that was jack and his hunters said ralph bitterly why cant they leave us alone 	we gave them something to think about said sam honesty compelled him to go on at least you did i got mixed up with myself in a corner 	i gave one of em what for said ralph i smashed him up all right he wont want to come and fight us again in a hurry 	so did i said eric when i woke up one was kicking me in the face i got an awful bloody face i think ralph but i did him in the end 	what did you do 	i got my knee up said eric with simple pride and i hit him with it in the pills you should have heard him holler he wont come back in a hurry either so we didnt do too badly 	ralph moved suddenly in the dark but then he heard eric working his mouth 	whats the matter  	jus a tooth loose 	piggy drew up his legs  	you all right piggy 	i thought they wanted the conch 	ralph trotted down the pale beach and jumped on to the platform the conch still glimmered by the chiefs seat he gazed for a moment or two then went back to piggy 	they didnt take the conch 	i know they didnt come for the conch they came for something else ralphwhat am i going to do 	far off along the bowstave of beach three figures trotted toward the castle rock they kept away from the forest and down by the water occasionally they sang softly occasionally they turned cartwheels down by the moving streak of phosphorescence the chief led then trotting steadily exulting in his achievement he was a chief now in truth and he made stabbing motions with his spear from his left hand dangled piggys broken glasses   chapter eleven  castle rock  	in the short chill of dawn the four boys gathered round the black smudge where the fire had been while ralph knelt and blew grey feathery ashes scurried hither and thither at his breath but no spark shone among them the twins watched anxiously and piggy sat expressionless behind the luminous wall of his myopia ralph continued to blow till his ears were singing with the effort but then the first breeze of dawn took the job off his hands and blinded him with ashes he squatted back swore and rubbed water out of his eyes 	no use 	eric looked down at him through a mask of dried blood piggy peered in the general direction of ralph 	 course its no use ralph now we got no fire 	ralph brought his face within a couple of feet of piggys 	can you see me 	a bit 	ralph allowed the swollen flap of his cheek to close his eye again 	theyve got our fire 	rage shrilled his voice 	they stole it 	thats them said piggy they blinded me see thats jack merridew you call an assembly ralph we got to decide what to do 	an assembly for only us 	its all we got samlet me hold on to you 	they went toward the platform 	blow the conch said piggy blow as loud as you can 	the forests reechoed and birds lifted crying out of the treetops as on that first morning ages ago both ways the beach was deserted some littluns came from the shelters ralph sat down on the polished trunk and the three others stood before him he nodded and samneric sat down on the right ralph pushed the conch into piggys hands he held the shining thing carefully and blinked at ralph 	go on then 	i just take the conch to say this i cant see no more and i got to get my glasses back awful things has been done on this island i voted for you for chief hes the only one who ever got anything done so now you speak ralph and tell us what or else 	piggy broke off sniveling ralph took back the conch as he sat down 	just an ordinary fire youd think we could do that wouldnt you just a smoke signal so we can be rescued are we savages or what only now theres no signal going up ships may be passing do you remember how he went hunting and the fire went out and a ship passed by and they all think hes best as chief then there was there was    thats his fault too if it hadnt been for him it would never have happened now piggy cant see and they came stealing ralphs voice ran up at night in darkness and stole our fire they stole it wed have given them fire if theyd asked but they stole it and the signals out and we cant ever be rescued dont you see what i mean wed have given them fire for themselves only they stole it i 	he paused lamely as the curtain flickered in his brain piggy held out his hands for the conch 	what you goin to do ralph this is jus talk without deciding i want my glasses 	im trying to think supposing we go looking like we used to washed and hair brushedafter all we arent savages really and being rescued isnt a game 	he opened the flap of his cheek and looked at the twins 	we could smarten up a bit and then go 	we ought to take spears said sam even piggy 	because we may need them 	you havent got the conch 	piggy held up the shell 	you can take spears if you want but i shant whats the good ill have to be led like a dog anyhow yes laugh go on laugh theres them on this island as would laugh at anything and what happened whats grownups goin to think young simon was murdered and there was that other kid what had a mark on his face whos seen him since we first come here 	piggy stop a minute 	i got the conch im going to that jack merridew an tell him i am 	youll get hurt 	what can he do more than he has ill tell him whats what you let me carry the conch ralph ill show him the one thing he hasnt got 	piggy paused for a moment and peered round at the dim figures the shape of the old assembly trodden in the grass listened to him 	im going to him with this conch in my hands im going to hold it out look im goin to say youre stronger than i am and you havent got asthma you can see im goin to say and with both eyes but i dont ask for my glasses back not as a favor i dont ask you to be a sport ill say not because youre strong but because whats rights right give me my glasses im going to sayyou got to 	piggy ended flushed and trembling he pushed the conch quickly into ralphs hands as though in a hurry to be rid of it and wiped the tears from his eyes the green light was gentle about them and the conch lay at ralphs feet fragile and white a single drop of water that had escaped piggys fingers now flashed on the delicate curve like a star 	at last ralph sat up straight and drew back his hair 	all right i meanyou can try if you like well go with you 	hell be painted said sam timidly you know how hell be 	he wont think much of us 	if he gets waxy weve had it 	ralph scowled at sam dimly he remembered something simon had said to him once by the rocks 	dont be silly he said and then he added quickly lets go 	he held out the conch to piggy who flushed this time with pride 	you must carry it 	when were ready ill carry it 	piggy sought in his mind for words to convey his passionate willingness to carry the conch against all odds 	i dont mind ill be glad ralph only ill have to be led 	ralph put the conch back on the shining log 	we better eat and then get ready 	they made their way to the devastated fruit trees piggy was helped to his food and found some by touch while they ate ralph thought of the afternoon 	well be like we were well wash 	sam gulped down a mouthful and protested 	but we bathe every day 	ralph looked at the filthy objects before him and sighed 	we ought to comb our hair only its too long 	ive got both socks left in the shelter said eric so we could pull them over our heads like caps sort of 	we could find some stuff said piggy and tie your hair back 	like a girl 	no course not 	then we must go as we are said ralph and they wont be any better 	eric made a detaining gesture 	but theyll be painted you know how it is the others nodded they understood only too well the liberation into savagery that the concealing paint brought 	well we wont be painted said ralph because we arent savages 	samneric looked at each other 	all the same 	ralph shouted  	no paint 	he tried to remember 	smoke he said we want smoke 	he turned on the twins fiercely  	i said smoke weve got to have smoke 	there was silence except for the multitudinous murmur of the bees as last piggy spoke kindly 	 course we have cos the smokes a signal and we cant be rescued if we dont have smoke 	i knew that shouted ralph he pulled his arm away from piggy are you suggesting 	im jus saying what you always say said piggy hastily id thought for a moment 	i hadnt said ralph loudly i knew it all the time i hadnt forgotten 	piggy nodded propitiatingly 	youre chief ralph you remember everything 	i hadnt forgotten 	 course not 	the twins were examining ralph curiously as though they were seeing him for the first time  	they set off along the beach in formation ralph went first limping a little his spear carried over one shoulder he saw things partially through the tremble of the heat haze over the flashing sands and his own long hair and injuries behind him came the twins worried now for a while but full of unquenchable vitality they said little but trailed the butts of their wooden spears for piggy had found that by looking down and shielding his tired sight from the sun he could just see these moving along the sand he walked between the trailing butts therefore the conch held carefully between his two hands the boys made a compact little group that moved over the beach four platelike shadows dancing and mingling beneath them there was no sign left of the storm and the beach was swept clean like a blade that has been scoured the sky and the mountain were at an immense distance shimmering in the heat and the reef was lifted by mirage floating in a kind of silver pool halfway up the sky 	they passed the place where the tribe had danced the charred sticks still lay on the rocks where the rain had quenched them but the sand by the water was smooth again they passed this in silence no one doubted that the tribe would be found at the castle rock and when they came in sight of it they stopped with one accord the densest tangle on the island a mass of twisted stems black and green and impenetrable lay on their left and tall grass swayed before them now ralph went forward 	here was the crushed grass where they had all lain when he had gone to prospect there was the neck of land the ledge skirting the rock up there were the red pinnacles 	sam touched his arm 	smoke 	there was a tiny smudge of smoke wavering into the air on the other side of the rock 	some firei dont think 	ralph turned 	what are we hiding for 	he stepped through the screen of grass on to the little open space that led to the narrow neck 	you two follow behind ill go first then piggy a pace behind me keep your spears ready 	piggy peered anxiously into the luminous veil that hung between him and the world 	is it safe aint there a cliff i can hear the sea 	you keep right close to me 	ralph moved forward on to the neck he kicked a stone and it bounded into the water then the sea sucked down revealing a red weedy square forty feet beneath ralphs left arm  	am i safe quavered piggy i feel awful 	high above them from the pinnacles came a sudden shout and then an imitation warcry that was answered by a dozen voices from behind the rock 	give me the conch and stay still 	halt who goes there 	ralph bent back his head and glimpsed rogers dark face at the top 	you can see who i am he shouted stop being silly 	he put the conch to his lips and began to blow savages appeared painted out of recognition edging round the ledge toward the neck they carried spears and disposed themselves to defend the entrance ralph went on blowing and ignored piggys terrors 	roger was shouting 	you mind outsee 	at length ralph took his lips away and paused to get his breath back his first words were a gasp but audible 	calling an assembly 	the savages guarding the neck muttered among themselves but made no motion ralph walked forwards a couple of steps a voice whispered urgently behind him 	dont leave me ralph 	you kneel down said ralph sideways and wait till i come back 	he stood halfway along the neck and gazed at the savages intently freed by the paint they had tied their hair back and were more comfortable than he was ralph made a resolution to tie his own back afterwards indeed he felt like telling them to wait and doing it there and then but that was impossible the savages sniggered a bit and one gestured at ralph with his spear high above roger took his hands off the lever and leaned out to see what was going on the boys on the neck stood in a pool of their own shadow diminished to shaggy heads piggy crouched his back shapeless as a sack 	im calling an assembly 	silence 	roger took up a small stone and flung it between the twins aiming to miss they started and sam only just kept his footing some source of power began to pulse in rogers body 	ralph spoke again loudly 	im calling an assembly 	he ran his eye over them 	wheres jack 	the group of boys stirred and consulted a painted face spoke with the voice of robert 	hes hunting and he said we werent to let you in 	ive come to see about the fire said ralph and about piggys specs 	the group in front of him shifted and laughter shivered outwards from among them light excited laughter that went echoing among the tall rocks 	a voice spoke from behind ralph 	what do you want 	the twins made a bolt past ralph and got between him and the entry he turned quickly jack identifiable by personality and red hair was advancing from the forest a hunter crouched on either side all three were masked in black and green behind them on the grass the headless and paunched body of a sow lay where they had dropped it 	piggy wailed 	ralph dont leave me 	with ludicrous care he embraced the rock pressing himself to it above the sucking sea the sniggering of the savages became a loud derisive jeer 	jack shouted above the noise 	you go away ralph you keep to your end this is my end and my tribe you leave me alone 	the jeering died away 	you pinched piggys specs said ralph breathlessly youve got to give them back 	got to who says 	ralphs temper blazed out 	i say you voted for me for chief didnt you hear the conch you played a dirty trickwed have given you fire if youd asked for it 	the blood was flowing in his cheeks and the bungedup eye throbbed 	you could have had fire whenever you wanted but you didnt you came sneaking up like a thief and stole piggys glasses 	say that again 	thief thief 	piggy screamed 	ralph mind me	 	jack made a rush and stabbed at ralphs chest with his spear ralph sensed the position of the weapon from the glimpse he caught of jacks arm and put the thrust aside with his own butt then he brought the end round and caught jack a stinger across the ear they were chest to chest breathing fiercely pushing and glaring 	whos a thief 	you are 	jack wrenched free and swung at ralph with his spear by common consent they were using the spears as sabers now no longer daring the lethal points the blow struck ralphs spear and slid down to fall agonizingly on his fingers then they were apart once more their positions reversed jack toward the castle rock and ralph on the outside toward the island 	both boys were breathing very heavily 	come on then 	come on 	truculently they squared up to each other but kept just out of fighting distance 	you come on and see what you get 	you come on 	piggy clutching the ground was trying to attract ralphs attention ralph moved bent down kept a wary eye on jack 	ralphremember what we came for the fire my specs 	ralph nodded he relaxed his fighting muscles stood easily and grounded the butt of his spear jack watched him inscrutably through his paint ralph glanced up at the pinnacles then toward the group of savages 	listen weve come to say this first youve got to give back piggys specs if he hasnt got them he cant see you arent playing the game 	the tribe of painted savages giggled and ralphs mind faltered he pushed his hair up and gazed at the green and black mask before him trying to remember what jack looked like 	piggy whispered 	and the fire 	oh yes then about the fire i say this again ive been saying it ever since we dropped in  	he held out his spear and pointed at the savages your only hope is keeping a signal fire going as long as theres light to see then maybe a shipll notice the smoke and come and rescue us and take us home but without that smoke weve got to wait till some ship comes by accident we might wait years till we were old 	the shivering silvery unreal laughter of the savages sprayed out and echoed away a gust of rage shook ralph his voice cracked 	dont you understand you painted fools sam eric piggy and mewe arent enough we tried to keep the fire going but we couldnt and then you playing at hunting    	he pointed past them to where the trickle of smoke dispersed in the pearly air 	look at that call that a signal fire thats a cooking fire now youll eat and therell be no smoke dont you understand there may be a ship out there 	he paused defeated by the silence and the painted anonymity of the group guarding the entry jack opened a pink mouth and addressed samneric who were between him and his tribe 	you two get back 	no one answered him the twins puzzled looked at each other while piggy reassured by the cessation of violence stood up carefully jack glanced back at ralph and then at the twins 	grab them 	no one moved jack shouted angrily 	i said grab them 	the painted group moved round samneric nervously and unhandily once more the silvery laughter scattered 	samneric protested out of the heart of civilization 	oh i say 	honestly 	their spears were taken from them 	tie them up 	ralph cried out hopelessly against the black and green mask  	jack 	go on tie them 	now the painted group felt the otherness of samneric felt the power in their own hands they felled the twins clumsily and excitedly jack was inspired he knew that ralph would attempt a rescue he struck in a humming circle behind him and ralph only just parried the blow beyond them the tribe and the twins were a loud and writhing heap piggy crouched again then the twins lay astonished and the tribe stood round them jack turned to ralph and spoke between his teeth 	see they do what i want 	there was silence again the twins lay inexpertly tied up and the tribe watched ralph to see what he would do he numbered them through his fringe glimpsed the ineffectual smoke 	his temper broke he screamed at jack 	youre a beast and a swine and a bloody bloody thief 	he charged 	jack knowing this was the crisis charged too they met with a jolt and bounced apart jack swung with his fist at ralph and caught him on the ear ralph hit jack in the stomach and made him grunt then they were facing each other again panting and furious but unnerved by each others ferocity they became aware of the noise that was the background to this fight the steady shrill cheering of the tribe behind them 	piggys voice penetrated to ralph 	let me speak 	he was standing in the dust of the fight and as the tribe saw his intention the shrill cheer changed to a steady booing 	piggy held up the conch and the booing sagged a little then came up again to strength 	i got the conch 	he shouted 	i tell you i got the conch 	surprisingly there was silence now the tribe were curious to hear what amusing thing he might have to say 	silence and pause but in the silence a curious airnoise close by ralphs head he gave it half his attentionand there it was again a faint zup someone was throwing stones roger was dropping them his one hand still on the lever below him ralph was a shock of hair and piggy a bag of fat 	i got this to say youre acting like a crowd of kids the booing rose and died again as piggy lifted the white magic shell 	which is betterto be a pack of painted indians like you are or to be sensible like ralph is 	a great clamor rose among the savages piggy shouted again 	which is betterto have rules and agree or to hunt and kill 	again the clamor and againzup 	ralph shouted against the noise 	which is better law and rescue or hunting and breaking things up 	now jack was yelling too and ralph could no longer make himself heard jack had backed right against the tribe and they were a solid mass of menace that bristled with spears the intention of a charge was forming among them they were working up to it and the neck would be swept clear ralph stood facing them a little to one side his spear ready by him stood piggy still holding out the talisman the fragile shining beauty of the shell the storm of sound beat at them an incantation of hatred high overhead roger with a sense of delirious abandonment leaned all his weight on the lever 	ralph heard the great rock before he saw it he was aware of a jolt in the earth that came to him through the soles of his feet and the breaking sound of stones at the top of the cliff then the monstrous red thing bounded across the neck and he flung himself flat while the tribe shrieked 	the rock struck piggy a glancing blow from chin to knee the conch exploded into a thousand white fragments and ceased to exist piggy saying nothing with no time for even a grunt traveled through the air sideways from the rock turning over as he went the rock bounded twice and was lost in the forest piggy fell forty feet and landed on his back across the square red rock in the sea his head opened and stuff came out and turned red piggys arms and legs twitched a bit like a pigs after it has been killed then the sea breathed again in a long slow sigh the water boiled white and pink over the rock and when it went sucking back again the body of piggy was gone 	this time the silence was complete ralphs lips formed a word but no sound came 	suddenly jack bounded out from the tribe and began screaming wildly 	see see thats what youll get i meant that there isnt a tribe for you any more the conch is gone 	he ran forward stooping 	im chief 	viciously with full intention he hurled his spear at ralph the point tore the skin and flesh over ralphs ribs then sheared off and fell in the water ralph stumbled feeling not pain but panic and the tribe screaming now like the chief began to advance another spear a bent one that would not fly straight went past his face and one fell from on high where roger was the twins lay hidden behind the tribe and the anonymous devils faces swarmed across the neck ralph turned and ran a great noise as of sea gulls rose behind him he obeyed an instinct that he did not know he possessed and swerved over the open space so that the spears went wide he saw the headless body of the sow and jumped in time then he was crashing through foliage and small boughs and was hidden by the forest  	the chief stopped by the pig turned and held up his hands 	back back to the fort 	presently the tribe returned noisily to the neck where roger joined them 	the chief spoke to him angrily 	why arent you on watch 	roger looked at him gravely 	i just came down 	the hangmans horror clung round him the chief said no more to him but looked down at samneric 	you got to join the tribe 	you lemme go 	and me 	the chief snatched one of the few spears that were left and poked sam in the ribs 	what dyou mean by it eh said the chief fiercely what dyou mean by coming with spears what dyou mean by not joining my tribe 	the prodding became rhythmic sam yelled 	thats not the way 	roger edged past the chief only just avoiding pushing him with his shoulder the yelling ceased and samneric lay looking up in quiet terror roger advanced upon them as one wielding a nameless authority   chapter twelve  cry of the hunters  	ralph lay in a covert wondering about his wounds the bruised flesh was inches in diameter over his right ribs with a swollen and bloody scar where the spear had hit him his hair was full of dirt and tapped like the tendrils of a creeper all over he was scratched and bruised from his flight through the forest by the time his breathing was normal again he had worked out that bathing these injuries would have to wait how could you listen for naked feet if you were splashing in water how could you be safe by the little stream or on the open beach 	ralph listened he was not really far from the castle rock and during the first panic he had thought he heard sounds of pursuit but the hunters had only sneaked into the fringes of the greenery retrieving spears perhaps and then had rushed back to the sunny rock as if terrified of the darkness under the leaves he had even glimpsed one of them striped brown black and red and had judged that it was bill but really thought ralph this was not bill this was a savage whose image refused to blend with that ancient picture of a boy in shorts and shirt 	the afternoon died away the circular spots of sunlight moved steadily over green fronds and brown fiber but no sound came from behind the rock at last ralph wormed out of the ferns and sneaked forward to the edge of that impenetrable thicket that fronted the neck of land he peered with elaborate caution between branches at the edge and could see robert sitting on guard at the top of the cliff he held a spear in his left hand and was tossing up a pebble and catching it again with the right behind him a column of smoke rose thickly so that ralphs nostrils flared and his mouth dribbled he wiped his nose and mouth with the back of his hand and for the first time since the morning felt hungry the tribe must be sitting round the gutted pig watching the fat ooze and burn among the ashes they would be intent 	another figure an unrecognizable one appeared by robert and gave him something then turned and went back behind the rock robert laid his spear on the rock beside him and began to gnaw between his raised hands so the feast was beginning and the watchman had been given his portion 	ralph saw that for the time being he was safe he limped away through the fruit trees drawn by the thought of the poor food yet bitter when he remembered the feast feast today and then tomorrow    	he argued unconvincingly that they would let him alone perhaps even make an outlaw of him but then the fatal unreasoning knowledge came to him again the breaking of the conch and the deaths of piggy and simon lay over the island like a vapor these painted savages would go further and further then there was that indefinable connection between himself and jack who therefore would never let him alone never 	he paused sunflecked holding up a bough prepared to duck under it a spasm of terror set him shaking and he cried aloud 	no theyre not as bad as that it was an accident 	he ducked under the bough ran clumsily then stopped and listened 	he came to the smashed acres of fruit and ate greedily he saw two littluns and not having any idea of his own appearance wondered why they screamed and ran 	when he had eaten he went toward the beach the sunlight was slanting now into the palms by the wrecked shelter there was the platform and the pool the best thing to do was to ignore this leaden feeling about the heart and rely on their common sense their daylight sanity now that the tribe had eaten the thing to do was to try again and anyway he couldnt stay here all night in an empty shelter by the deserted platform his flesh crept and he shivered in the evening sun no fire no smoke no rescue he turned and limped away through the forest toward jacks end of the island 	the slanting sticks of sunlight were lost among the branches at length he came to a clearing in the forest where rock prevented vegetation from growing now it was a pool of shadows and ralph nearly flung himself behind a tree when he saw something standing in the center but then he saw that the white face was bone and that the pigs skull grinned at him from the top of a stick he walked slowly into the middle of the clearing and looked steadily at the skull that gleamed as white as ever the conch had done and seemed to jeer at him cynically an inquisitive ant was busy in one of the eye sockets but otherwise the thing was lifeless 	or was it 	little prickles of sensation ran up and down his back he stood the skull about on a level with his face and held up his hair with two hands the teeth grinned the empty sockets seemed to hold his gaze masterfully and without effort 	what was it 	the skull regarded ralph like one who knows all the answers and wont tell a sick fear and rage swept him fiercely he hit out at the filthy thing in front of him that bobbed like a toy and came back still grinning into his face so that he lashed and cried out in loathing then he was licking his bruised knuckles and looking at the bare stick while the skull lay in two pieces its grin now six feet across he wrenched the quivering stick from the crack and held it as a spear between him and the white pieces then he backed away keeping his face to the skull that lay grinning at the sky 	when the green glow had gone from the horizon and night was fully accomplished ralph came again to the thicket in front of the castle rock peeping through he could see that the height was still occupied and whoever it was up there had a spear at the ready 	he knelt among the shadows and felt his isolation bitterly they were savages it was true but they were human and the ambushing fears of the deep night were coming on 	ralph moaned faintly tired though he was he could not relax and fall into a well of sleep for fear of the tribe might it not be possible to walk boldly into the fort say ive got pax laugh lightly and sleep among the others pretend they were still boys schoolboys who had said sir yes sirand worn caps daylight might have answered yes but darkness and the horrors of death said no lying there in the darkness he knew he was an outcast 	 cos i had some sense 	he rubbed his cheek along his forearm smelling the acrid scent of salt and sweat and the staleness of dirt over to the left the waves of ocean were breathing sucking down then boiling back over the rock 	there were sounds coming from behind the castle rock listening carefully detaching his mind from the swing of the sea ralph could make out a familiar rhythm 	kill the beast cut his throat spill his blood 	the tribe was dancing somewhere on the other side of this rocky wall there would be a dark circle a glowing fire and meat they would be savoring food and the comfort of safety 	a noise nearer at hand made him quiver savages were clambering up the castle rock right up to the top and he could hear voices he sneaked forward a few yards and saw the shape at the top of the rock change and enlarge there were only two boys on the island who moved or talked like that 	ralph put his head down on his forearms and accepted this new fact like a wound samneric were part of the tribe now they were guarding the castle rock against him there was no chance of rescuing them and building up an outlaw tribe at the other end of the island samneric were savages like the rest piggy was dead and the conch smashed to powder 	at length the guard climbed down the two that remained seemed nothing more than a dark extension of the rock a star appeared behind them and was momentarily eclipsed by some movement 	ralph edged forward feeling his way over the uneven surface as though he were blind there were miles of vague water at his right and the restless ocean lay under his left hand as awful as the shaft of a pit every minute the water breathed round the death rock and flowered into a field of whiteness ralph crawled until he found the ledge of the entry in his grasp the lookouts were immediately above him and he could see the end of a spear projecting over the rock 	he called very gently 	samneric  	there was no reply to carry he must speak louder and this would rouse those striped and inimical creatures from their feasting by the fire he set his teeth and started to climb finding the holds by touch the stick that had supported a skull hampered him but he would not be parted from his only weapon he was nearly level with the twins before he spoke again 	samneric 	he heard a cry and a flurry from the rock the twins had grabbed each other and were gibbering 	its me ralph 	terrified that they would run and give the alarm he hauled himself up until his head and shoulders stuck over the top far below his armpit he saw the luminous flowering round the rock 	its only me ralph 	at length they bent forward and peered in his face 	we thought it was 	we didnt know what it was 	we thought 	memory of their new and shameful loyalty came to them eric was silent but sam tried to do his duty 	you got to go ralph you go away now 	he wagged his spear and essayed fierceness 	you shove off see 	eric nodded agreement and jabbed his spear in the air ralph leaned on his arms and did not go 	i came to see you two 	his voice was thick his throat was hurting him now though it had received no wound 	i came to see you two 	words could not express the dull pain of these things he fell silent while the vivid stars were spilt and danced all ways 	sam shifted uneasily 	honest ralph youd better go	 	ralph looked up again 	you two arent painted how can you if it were light 	if it were light shame would burn them at admitting these things but the night was dark eric took up and then the twins started their antiphonal speech 	you got to go because its not safe 	they made us they hurt us 	who jack 	oh no 	they bent to him and lowered their voices 	push off ralph 	its a tribe 	they made us 	we couldnt help it 	when ralph spoke again his voice was low and seemed breathless 	what have i done i liked himand i wanted us to be rescued 	again the stars spilled about the sky eric shook his head earnestly 	listen ralph never mind whats sense thats gone 	never mind about the chief 	you got to go for your own good 	the chief and roger 	yes roger 	they hate you ralph theyre going to do you 	theyre going to hunt you tomorrow 	but why 	i dunno and ralph jack the chief says itll be dangerous 	and weve got to be careful and throw our spears like at a pig 	were going to spread out in a line across the island 	were going forward from this end 	until we find you 	weve got to give signals like this 	eric raised his head and achieved a faint ululation by beating on his open mouth then he glanced behind him nervously 	like that 	only louder of course 	but ive done nothing whispered ralph urgently i only wanted to keep up a fire 	he paused for a moment thinking miserably of the morrow a matter of overwhelming importance occurred to him 	what are you 	he could not bring himself to be specific at first but then fear and loneliness goaded him 	when they find me what are they going to do 	the twins were silent beneath him the death rock flowered again 	what are theyoh god im hungry 	the towering rock seemed to sway under him 	wellwhat 	the twins answered his question indirectly 	you got to go now ralph 	for your own good 	keep away as far as you can 	wont you come with me three of uswed stand a chance 	after a moments silence sam spoke in a strangled voice 	you dont know roger hes a terror 	and the chieftheyre both 	terrors 	only roger 	both boys froze someone was climbing toward them from the tribe 	hes coming to see if were keeping watch quick ralph 	as he prepared to let himself down the cliff ralph snatched at the last possible advantage to be wrung out of this meeting 	ill lie up close in that thicket down there he whispered so keep them away from it theyll never think to look so close 	the footsteps were still some distance away 	samim going to be all right arent i 	the twins were silent again 	here said sam suddenly take this 	ralph felt a chunk of meat pushed against him and grabbed it 	but what are you going to do when you catch me 	silence above he sounded silly to himself he lowered himself down the rock 	what are you going to do 	from the top of the towering rock came the incomprehensible reply  	roger sharpened a stick at both ends 	roger sharpened a stick at both ends ralph tried to attach a meaning to this but could not he used all the bad words he could think of in a fit of temper that passed into yawning how long could you go without sleep he yearned for a bed and sheetsbut the only whiteness here was the slow spilt milk luminous round the rock forty feet below where piggy had fallen piggy was everywhere was on this neck was become terrible in darkness and death if piggy were to come back now out of the water with his empty headralph whimpered and yawned like a littlun the stick in his hand became a crutch on which he reeled  	then he tensed again there were voices raised on the top of the castle rock samneric were arguing with someone but the ferns and the grass were near that was the place to be in hidden and next to the thicket that would serve for tomorrows hideout hereand his hands touched grasswas a place to be in for the night not far from the tribe so that if the horrors of the supernatural emerged one could at least mix with humans for the time being even if it meant    	what did it mean a stick sharpened at both ends what was there in that they had thrown spears and missed all but one perhaps they would miss next time too 	he squatted down in the tall grass remembered the meat that sam had given him and began to tear at it ravenously while he was eating he heard fresh noisescries of pain from samneric cries of panic angry voices what did it mean someone besides himself was in trouble for at least one of the twins was catching it then the voices passed away down the rock and he ceased to think of them he felt with his hands and found cool delicate fronds backed against the thicket here then was the nights lair at first light he would creep into the thicket squeeze between the twisted stems ensconce himself so deep that only a crawler like himself could come through and that crawler would be jabbed there he would sit and the search would pass him by and the cordon waver on ululating along the island and he would be free 	he pulled himself between the ferns tunneling in he laid the stick beside him and huddled himself down in the blackness one must remember to wake at first light in order to diddle the savagesand he did not know how quickly sleep came and hurled him down a dark interior slope  	he was awake before his eyes were open listening to a noise that was near he opened an eye found the mold an inch or so from his face and his fingers gripped into it light filtering between the fronds of fern he had just time to realize that the agelong nightmares of falling and death were past and that the morning was come when he heard the sound again it was an ululation over by the seashore and now the next savage answered and the next the cry swept by him across the narrow end of the island from sea to lagoon like the cry of a flying bird he took no time to consider but grabbed his sharp stick and wriggled back among the ferns within seconds he was worming his way into the thicket but not before he had glimpsed the legs of a savage coming toward him the ferns were thumped and beaten and he heard legs moving in the long grass the savage whoever he was ululated twice and the cry was repeated in both directions then died away ralph crouched still tangled in the ferns and for a time he heard nothing 	at last he examined the thicket itself certainly no one could attack him hereand moreover he had a stroke of luck the great rock that had killed piggy had bounded into this thicket and bounced there right in the center making a smashed space a few feet in extent each way when ralph had wriggled into this he felt secure and clever he sat down carefully among the smashed stems and waited for the hunt to pass looking up between the leaves he caught a glimpse of something red that must be the top of the castle rock distant and unmenacing he composed himself triumphantly to hear the sounds of the hunt dying away 	yet no one made a sound and as the minutes passed in the green shade his feeling of triumph faded 	at last he heard a voicejacks voice but hushed 	are you certain 	the savage addressed said nothing perhaps he made a gesture 	roger spoke 	if youre fooling us 	immediately after this there came a gasp and a squeal of pain ralph crouched instinctively one of the twins was there outside the thicket with jack and roger 	youre sure he meant in there	 	the twin moaned faintly and then squealed again 	he meant hed hide in there 	yesyesoh 	silver laughter scattered among the trees 	so they knew 	ralph picked up his stick and prepared for battle but what could they do it would take them a week to break a path through the thicket and anyone who wormed his way in would be helpless he felt the point of his spear with his thumb and grinned without amusement whoever tried that would be stuck squealing like a pig  	they were going away back to the tower rock he could hear feet moving and then someone sniggered there came again that high birdlike cry that swept along the line so some were still watching for him but some 	there was a long breathless silence ralph found that he had bark in his mouth from the gnawed spear he stood and peered upwards to the castle rock 	as he did so he heard jacks voice from the top 	heave heave heave 	the red rock that he could see at the top of the cliff vanished like a curtain and he could see figures and blue sky a moment later the earth jolted there was a rushing sound in the air and the top of the thicket was cuffed as with a gigantic hand the rock bounded on thumping and smashing toward the beach while a shower of broken twigs and leaves fell on him beyond the thicket the tribe was cheering 	silence again 	ralph put his fingers in his mouth and bit them there was only one other rock up there that they might conceivably move but that was half as big as a cottage big as a car a tank he visualized its probable progress with agonizing clearnessthat one would start slowly drop from ledge to ledge trundle across the neck like an outsize steamroller 	heave heave heave 	ralph put down his spear then picked it up again he pushed his hair back irritably took two hasty steps across the little space and then came back he stood looking at the broken ends of branches 	still silence 	he caught sight of the rise and fall of his diaphragm and was surprised to see how quickly he was breathing just left of center his heartbeats were visible he put the spear down again 	heave heave heave  	a shrill prolonged cheer 	something boomed up on the red rock then the earth jumped and began to shake steadily while the noise as steadily increased ralph was shot into the air thrown down dashed against branches at his right hand and only a few feet away the whole thicket bent and the roots screamed as they came out of the earth together he saw something red that turned over slowly as a mill wheel then the red thing was past and the elephantine progress diminished toward the sea 	ralph knelt on the plowedup soil and waited for the earth to come back presently the white broken stumps the split sticks and the tangle of the thicket refocused there was a kind of heavy feeling in his body where he had watched his own pulse 	silence again 	yet not entirely so they were whispering out there and suddenly the branches were shaken furiously at two places on his right the pointed end of a stick appeared in panic ralph thrust his own stick through the crack and struck with all his might 	aaaah 	his spear twisted a little in his hands and then he withdrew it again 	oohooh 	someone was moaning outside and a babble of voices rose a fierce argument was going on and the wounded savage kept groaning then when there was silence a single voice spoke and ralph decided that it was not jacks 	see i told youhes dangerous 	the wounded savage moaned again 	what else what next 	ralph fastened his hands round the chewed spear and his hair fell someone was muttering only a few yards away toward the castle rock he heard a savage say no in a shocked voice and then there was suppressed laughter he squatted back on his heels and showed his teeth at the wall of branches he raise his spear snarled a little and waited 	once more the invisible group sniggered he heard a curious trickling sound and then a louder crepitation as if someone were unwrapping great sheets of cellophane a stick snapped and he stifled a cough smoke was seeping through the branches in white and yellow wisps the patch of blue sky overhead turned to the color of a storm cloud and then the smoke billowed round him 	someone laughed excitedly and a voice shouted 	smoke 	he wormed his way through the thicket toward the forest keeping as far as possible beneath the smoke presently he saw open space and the green leaves of the edge of the thicket a smallish savage was standing between him and the rest of the forest a savage striped red and white and carrying a spear he was coughing and smearing the paint about his eyes with the back of his hand as he tried to see through the increasing smoke ralph launched himself like a cat stabbed snarling with the spear and the savage doubled up there was a shout from beyond the thicket and then ralph was running with the swiftness of fear through the undergrowth he came to a pigrun followed it for perhaps a hundred yards and then swerved off behind him the ululation swept across the island once more and a single voice shouted three times he guessed that was the signal to advance and sped away again till his chest was like fire then he flung himself down under a bush and waited for a moment till his breathing steadied he passed his tongue tentatively over his teeth and lips and heard far off the ululation of the pursuers 	there were many things he could do he could climb a tree but that was putting all his eggs in one basket if he were detected they had nothing more difficult to do than wait 	if only one had time to think 	another double cry at the same distance gave him a clue to their plan any savage balked in the forest would utter the double shout and hold up the line till he was free again that way they might hope to keep the cordon unbroken right across the island ralph thought of the boar that had broken through them with such ease if necessary when the chase came too close he could charge the cordon while it was still thin burst through and run back but run back where the cordon would turn and sweep again sooner or later he would have to sleep or eatand then he would awaken with hands clawing at him and the hunt would become a running down 	what was to be done then the tree burst the line like a boar either way the choice was terrible 	a single cry quickened his heartbeat and leaping up he dashed away toward the ocean side and the thick jungle till he was hung up among creepers he stayed there for a moment with his calves quivering if only one could have quiet a long pause a time to think 	and there again shrill and inevitable was the ululation sweeping across the island at that sound he shied like a horse among the creepers and ran once more till he was panting he flung himself down by some ferns the tree or the charge he mastered his breathing for a moment wiped his mouth and told himself to be calm samneric were somewhere in that line and hating it or were they and supposing instead of them he met the chief or roger who carried death in his hands 	ralph pushed back his tangled hair and wiped the sweat out of his best eye he spoke aloud 	think 	what was the sensible thing to do 	there was no piggy to talk sense there was no solemn assembly for debate nor dignity of the conch 	think 	most he was beginning to dread the curtain that might waver in his brain blacking out the sense of danger making a simpleton of him 	a third idea would be to hide so well that the advancing line would pass without discovering him 	he jerked his head off the ground and listened there was another noise to attend to now a deep grumbling noise as though the forest itself were angry with him a somber noise across which the ululations were scribbled excruciatingly as on slate he knew he had heard it before somewhere but had no time to remember 	break the line 	a tree 	hide and let them pass 	a nearer cry stood him on his feet and immediately he was away again running fast among thorns and brambles suddenly he blundered into the open found himself again in that open spaceand there was the fathomwide grin of the skull no longer ridiculing a deep blue patch of sky but jeering up into a blanket of smoke then ralph was running beneath trees with the grumble of the forest explained they had smoked him out and set the island on fire 	hide was better than a tree because you had a chance of breaking the line if you were discovered 	hide then 	he wondered if a pig would agree and grimaced at nothing find the deepest thicket the darkest hole on the island and creep in now as he ran he peered about him bars and splashes of sunlight flitted over him and sweat made glistening streaks on his dirty body the cries were far now and faint 	at last he found what seemed to him the right place though the decision was desperate here bushes and a wild tangle of creeper made a mat that kept out all the light of the sun beneath it was a space perhaps a foot high though it was pierced everywhere by parallel and rising stems if you wormed into the middle of that you would be five yards from the edge and hidden unless the savage chose to lie down and look for you and even then you would be in darknessand if the worst happened and he saw you then you had a chance to burst out at him fling the whole line out of step and double back 	cautiously his stick trailing behind him ralph wormed between the rising stems when he reached the middle of the mat he lay and listened 	the fire was a big one and the drumroll that he had thought was left so far behind was nearer couldnt a fire outrun a galloping horse he could see the sunsplashed ground over an area of perhaps fifty yards from where he lay and as he watched the sunlight in every patch blinked at him this was so like the curtain that flapped in his brain that for a moment he thought the blinking was inside him but then the patches blinked more rapidly dulled and went out so that he saw that a great heaviness of smoke lay between the island and the sun 	if anyone peered under the bushes and chanced to glimpse human flesh it might be samneric who would pretend not to see and say nothing he laid his cheek against the chocolatecolored earth licked his dry lips and closed his eyes under the thicket the earth was vibrating very slightly or perhaps there was a sound beneath the obvious thunder of the fire and scribbled ululations that was too low to hear 	someone cried out ralph jerked his cheek off the earth and looked into the dulled light they must be near now he thought and his chest began to thump hide break the line climb a treewhich was the best after all the trouble was you only had one chance 	now the fire was nearer those volleying shots were great limbs trunks even bursting the fools the fools the fire must be almost at the fruit treeswhat would they eat tomorrow 	ralph stirred restlessly in his narrow bed one chanced nothing what could they do beat him so what kill him a stick sharpened at both ends 	the cries suddenly nearer jerked him up he could see a striped savage moving hastily out of a green tangle and coming toward the mat where he hid a savage who carried a spear ralph gripped his fingers into the earth be ready now in case 	ralph fumbled to hold his spear so that it was point foremost and now he saw that the stick was sharpened at both ends 	the savage stopped fifteen yards away and uttered his cry 	perhaps he can hear my heart over the noises of the fire dont scream get ready 	the savage moved forward so that you could only see him from the waist down that was the butt of his spear now you could see him from the knee down dont scream 	a herd of pigs came squealing out of the greenery behind the savage and rushed away into the forest birds were screaming mice shrieking and a little hopping thing came under the mat and cowered 	five yards away the savage stopped standing right by the thicket and cried out ralph drew his feet up and crouched the stake was in his hands the stake sharpened at both ends the stake that vibrated so wildly that grew long short light heavy light again 	the ululation spread from shore to shore the savage knelt down by the edge of the thicket and there were lights flickering in the forest behind him you could see a knee disturb the mold now the other two hands a spear 	a face 	the savage peered into the obscurity beneath the thicket you could tell that he saw light on this side and on that but not in the middlethere in the middle was a blob of dark and the savage wrinkled up his face trying to decipher the darkness 	the seconds lengthened ralph was looking straight into the savages eyes 	dont scream 	youll get back 	now hes seen you hes making sure a stick sharpened 	ralph screamed a scream of fright and anger and desperation his legs straightened the screams became continuous and foaming he shot forward burst the thicket was in the open screaming snarling bloody he swung the stake and the savage tumbled over but there were others coming toward him crying out he swerved as a spear flew past and then was silent running all at once the lights flickering ahead of him merged together the roar of the forest rose to thunder and a tall bush directly in his path burst into a great fanshaped flame he swung to the right running desperately fast with the heat beating on his left side and the fire racing forward like a tide the ululation rose behind him and spread along a series of short sharp cries the sighting call a brown figure showed up at his right and fell away they were all running all crying out madly he could hear them crashing in the undergrowth and on the left was the hot bright thunder of the fire he forgot his wounds his hunger and thirst and became fear hopeless fear on flying feet rushing through the forest toward the open beach spots jumped before his eyes and turned into red circles that expanded quickly till they passed out of sight below him someones legs were getting tired and the desperate ululation advanced like a jagged fringe of menace and was almost overhead 	he stumbled over a root and the cry that pursued him rose even higher he saw a shelter burst into flames and the fire flapped at his right shoulder and there was the glitter of water then he was down rolling over and over in the warm sand crouching with arm to ward off trying to cry for mercy  	he staggered to his feet tensed for more terrors and looked up at a huge peaked cap it was a whitetopped cap and above the green shade of the peak was a crown an anchor gold foliage he saw white drill epaulettes a revolver a row of gilt buttons down the front of a uniform 	a naval officer stood on the sand looking down at ralph in wary astonishment on the beach behind him was a cutter her bows hauled up and held by two ratings in the sternsheets another rating held a submachine gun 	the ululation faltered and died away 	the officer looked at ralph doubtfully for a moment then took his hand away from the butt of the revolver 	hullo 	squirming a little conscious of his filthy appearance ralph answered shyly 	hullo 	the officer nodded as if a question had been answered 	are there any adultsany grownups with you 	dumbly ralph shook his head he turned a halfpace on the sand a semicircle of little boys their bodies streaked with colored clay sharp sticks in their hands were standing on the beach making no noise at all 	fun and games said the officer 	the fire reached the coconut palms by the beach and swallowed them noisily a flame seemingly detached swung like an acrobat and licked up the palm heads on the platform the sky was black 	the officer grinned cheerfully at ralph 	we saw your smoke what have you been doing having a war or something 	ralph nodded 	the officer inspected the little scarecrow in front of him the kid needed a bath a haircut a nosewipe and a good deal of ointment 	nobody killed i hope any dead bodies 	only two and theyve gone 	the officer leaned down and looked closely at ralph 	two killed 	ralph nodded again behind him the whole island was shuddering with flame the officer knew as a rule when people were telling the truth he whistled softly 	other boys were appearing now tiny tots some of them brown with the distended bellies of small savages one of them came close to the officer and looked up 	im im 	but there was no more to come percival wemys madison sought in his head for an incantation that had faded clean away 	the officer turned back to ralph 	well take you off how many of you are there 	ralph shook his head the officer looked past him to the group of painted boys 	whos boss here 	i am said ralph loudly 	a little boy who wore the remains of an extraordinary black cap on his red hair and who carried the remains of a pair of spectacles at his waist started forward then changed his mind and stood still 	we saw your smoke and you dont know how many of you there are 	no sir 	i should have thought said the officer as he visualized the search before him i should have thought that a pack of british boysyoure all british arent youwould have been able to put up a better show than thati mean 	it was like that at first said ralph before things 	he stopped 	we were together then 	the officer nodded helpfully 	i know jolly good show like the coral island 	ralph looked at him dumbly for a moment he had a fleeting picture of the strange glamour that had once invested the beaches but the island was scorched up like dead woodsimon was deadand jack had    the tears began to flow and sobs shook him he gave himself up to them now for the first time on the island great shuddering spasms of grief that seemed to wrench his whole body his voice rose under the black smoke before the burning wreckage of the island and infected by that emotion the other little boys began to shake and sob too and in the middle of them with filthy body matted hair and unwiped nose ralph wept for the end of innocence the darkness of mans heart and the fall through the air of the true wise friend called piggy 	the officer surrounded by these noises was moved and a little embarrassed he turned away to give them time to pull themselves together and waited allowing his eyes to rest on the trim cruiser in the distance      notes on lord of the flies   the above notes pretend to be no more than a series of reflections on aspects of lord of the flies an exhaustive study of its symbolism has not yet been attempted  	in answer to a publicity questionnaire from the american publishers of lord of the flies william golding born cornwall 1911 declared that he was brought up to be a scientist and revolted after two years of oxford he changed his educational emphasis from science to english literature and became devoted to anglosaxon after publishing a volume of poetry he wasted the next four years and when word war ii broke out he joined the royal navy for the next five years he was involved in naval matters except for a few months in new york and six months with lord cherwell in a research establishment he finished his naval career as a lieutenant in command of a rocket ship he had seen action against battleships submarines and aircraft and had participated in the walcheren and dday operations after the war he began teaching and writing today his novels include lord of the flies cowardmccann the inheritors which may loosely be described as a novel of prehistory but is like all of goldings work much more and pincher martin published in hardcover by harcourt brace as the two deaths of christopher martin he lists his hobbies as thinking classical greek sailing and archaeology and his literary influences as euripides and the anonymous anglosaxon author of the battle of maldon 	the theme of lord of the flies is described by golding as follows in the same publicity questionnaire the theme is an attempt to trace the defects of society back to the defects of human nature the moral is that the shape of a society must depend on the ethical nature of the individual and not on any political system however apparently logical or respectable the whole book is symbolic in nature except the rescue in the end where adult life appears dignified and capable but in reality enmeshed in the same evil as the symbolic life of the children on the island the officer having interrupted a manhunt prepares to take the children off the island in a cruiser which will presently be hunting its enemy in the same implacable way and who will rescue the adult and his cruiser 	this is of course merely a casual summingup on mr goldings part of his extremely complex and beautifully woven symbolic web which becomes apparent as we follow through the book but it does indicate that lord of the flies is not to say the least a simple adventure story of boys on a desert island in fact the implications of the story go far beyond the degeneration of a few children what is unique about the work of golding is the way he has combined and synthesized all of the characteristically twentiethcentury methods of analysis of the human being and human society and used this unified knowledge to comment on a test situation in this book as in few others at the present time are findings of psychoanalysis of all schools anthropologists social psychologists and philosophical historians mobilized into an attack upon the central problem of modern thought the nature of the human personality and the reflection of personality on society 	another feature of goldings work is the superb use of symbolism a symbolism that works the central symbol itself the lord of the flies is like any true symbol much more than the sum of its parts but some elements of it may be isolated the lord of the flies is a translation of the hebrew baalzevuv beelzebub in greek it has been suggested that it was a mistranslation of a mistransliterated word which gave us this pungent and suggestive name for the devil a devil whose name suggests that he is devoted to decay destruction demoralization hysteria and panic and who therefore fits in very well with goldings theme 	the devil is not present in any traditional religious sense goldings beelzebub is the modern equivalent the anarchic amoral driving force that freudians call the id whose only function seems to be to insure the survival of the host in which it is embedded or embodied which function it performs with tremendous and singleminded tenacity although it is possible to find other names for this force the modern picture of the personality whether drawn by theologians or psychoanalysts inevitably includes this force or psychic structure as the fundamental principle of the natural man the tenets of civilization the moral and social codes the ego the intelligence itself form only a veneer over this whitehot power this uncontrollable force the fury and the mire of human veins dostoievsky found salvation in this freedom although he found damnation in it also yeats found in it the only source of creative genius whatever flames upon the night mans own resinous heart has fed conrad was appalled by this heart of darkness and existentialists find in the denial of this freedom the source of perversion of all human values indeed one could if one were so minded go through the entire canon of modern literature philosophy and psychology and find this great basic drive defined as underlying the most fundamental conclusions of modem thought 	the emergence of this concealed basic wildness is the theme of the book the struggle between ralph the representative of civilization with his parliaments and his brain trust piggy the intellectual whose shattering spectacles mark the progressive decay of rational influence as the story progresses and jack in whom the spark of wildness burns hotter and closer to the surface than in ralph and who is the leader of the forces of anarchy on the island is also of course the struggle in modern society between those same forces translated onto a worldwide scale 	the turning point in the struggle between ralph and jack is the killing of the sow pp 133144 the sow is a mother sunk in deep maternal bliss lay the largest of the lot    the great bladder of her belly was fringed with a row of piglets that slept or burrowed and squeaked the killing of the sow is accomplished in terms of sexual intercourse  		they were just behind her when she staggered into an open 	space where bright flowers grew and butterflies danced round each 	other and the air was hot and still 		here struck down by the heat the sow fell and the 	hunters hurled themselves at her this dreadful eruption from an 	unknown world made her frantic she squealed and bucked and the 	air was full of sweat and noise and blood and terror roger ran 	round the heap prodding with his spear whenever pigflesh 	appeared jack was on top of the sow stabbing downward with his 	knife roger a natural sadist who becomes the official 	torturer and executioner for the tribe found a lodgment for his 	point and began to push till he was leaning with his whole weight 	the spear moved forward inch by inch and the terrified squealing 	became a highpitched scream then jack found the throat and the 	hot blood spouted over his hands the sow collapsed under them and 	they were heavy and fulfilled upon her the butterflies still 	danced preoccupied in the center of the clearing  	the pigs head is cut off a stick is sharpened at both ends and jammed in a crack in the earth the death planned for ralph at the end of the book involves a stick sharpened at both ends the pigs head is impaled on the stick    the head hung there a little blood dribbling down the stick instinctively the boys drew back too and the forest was very still they listened and the loudest noise was the buzzing of flies over the spilled guts jack offers this grotesque trophy to the beast the terrible animal that the littler children had been dreaming of and which seems to be lurking on the island wherever they were not looking the entire incident forms a horrid parody of an oedipal wedding night these emotions the sensations aroused by murder and death and the overpowering and unaccustomed emotions of sexual love experienced by the halfgrown boys plus their own irrational fears and blind terrors release the forces of death and the devil on the island 	after this occurs the most deeply symbolic incident in the book the interview of simon an embryo mystic with the head the head seems to be saying to simons heightened perceptions that everything was a bad business    the halfshut eyes were dim with the infinite cynicism of adult life simon fights with all his feeble power against the message of the head against the ancient inescapable recognition the recognition of human capacities for evil and the superficial nature of human moral systems it is the knowledge of the end of innocence for which ralph is to weep at the close of the book fancy thinking the beast was something you could hunt and kill said the head for a moment or two the forest and all the other dimly appreciated places echoes with the parody of laughter you knew didnt you im part of you close close close im the reason why its no go why things are what they are 	at the end of this fantastic scene simon imagines he is looking into a vast mouth there was blackness within a blackness that spread    simon was inside the mouth he fell down and lost consciousness this mouth  the symbol of ravenous unreasoning and eternally insatiable nature appears again in pincher martin in which the development of the theme of a nature inimical to the conscious personality of man is developed in a stunning fashion in lord of the flies however only the outline of a philosophy is sketched and the boys of the island are figures in a parable or fable which like all great parables or fables reveals to the reader an intimate disquieting connection between the innocent timepassing storytelling aspect of its surface and the great dimly appreciated depths of its interior   cf conrads heart of darkness i saw the dying kurtz open his mouth wideit gave him a weirdly voracious aspect as though he wanted to swallow all the air all the earth all the men before him indeed golding seems very close to conrad both in basic principles and in artistic method  						e l epstein
