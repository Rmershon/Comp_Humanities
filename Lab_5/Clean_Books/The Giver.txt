was beginning to be frightened no wrong word jonas thought frightened meant that deep sickening feeling of something terrible about to happen frightened was the way he had felt a year ago when an unidentified aircraft had overflown the community twice he had seen it both times squinting toward the sky he had seen the sleek jet almost a blur at its high speed go past and a second later heard the blast of sound that followed then one more time a moment later from the opposite direction the same plane  at first he had been only fascinated he had never seen aircraft so close for it was against the rules for pilots to fly over the community occasionally when supplies were delivered by cargo planes to the landing field across the river the children rode their bicycles to the riverbank and watched intrigued the unloading and then the takeoff directed to the west always away from the community  but the aircraft a year ago had been different it was not a squat fatbellied cargo plane but a needlenosed singlepilot jet jonas looking around anxiously had seen othersadults as well as childrenstop what they were doing and wait confused for an explanation of the frightening event  then all of the citizens had been ordered to go into the nearest building and stay there immediately the rasping voice through the speakers had said leave your bicycles where they are  instantly obediently jonas had dropped his bike on its side on the path behind his familys dwelling he had run indoors and stayed there alone his parents were both at work and his little sister lily was at the childcare center where she spent her afterschool hours  looking through the front window he had seen no people none of the busy afternoon crew of street cleaners landscape workers and food delivery people who usually populated the community at that time of day he saw only the abandoned bikes here and there on their sides an upturned wheel on one was still revolving slowly  he had been frightened then the sense of his own community silent waiting had made his stomach churn he had trembled  but it had been nothing within minutes the speakers had crackled again and the voice reassuring now and less urgent had explained that a pilotintraining had misread his navigational instructions and made a wrong turn desperately the pilot had been trying to make his way back before his error was noticed  needless to say he will be released the voice had said followed by silence there was an ironic tone to that final message as if the speaker found it amusing and jonas had smiled a little though he knew what a grim statement it had been for a contributing citizen to be released from the community was a final decision a terrible punishment an overwhelming statement of failure  even the children were scolded if they used the term lightly at play jeering at a teammate who missed a catch or stumbled in a race jonas had done it once had shouted at his best friend thats it asher youre released when ashers clumsy error had lost a match for his team he had been taken aside for a brief and serious talk by the coach had hung his head with guilt and embarrassment and apologized to asher after the game  now thinking about the feeling of fear as he pedaled home along the river path he remembered that moment of palpable stomachsinking terror when the aircraft had streaked above it was not what he was feeling now with december approaching he searched for the right word to describe his own feeling  jonas was careful about language not like his friend asher who talked too fast and mixed things up scrambling words and phrases until they were barely recognizable and often very funny  jonas grinned remembering the morning that asher had dashed into the classroom late as usual arriving breathlessly in the middle of the chanting of the morning anthem when the class took their seats at the conclusion of the patriotic hymn asher remained standing to make his public apology as was required  i apologize for inconveniencing my learning community asher ran through the standard apology phrase rapidly still catching his breath the instructor and class waited patiently for his explanation the students had all been grinning because they had listened to ashers explanations so many times before  i left home at the correct time but when i was riding along near the hatchery the crew was separating some salmon i guess i just got distraught watching them  i apologize to my classmates asher concluded he smoothed his rumpled tunic and sat down  we accept your apology asher the class recited the standard response in unison many of the students were biting their lips to keep from laughing  i accept your apology asher the instructor said he was smiling and i thank you because once again you have provided an opportunity for a lesson in language distraught is too strong an adjective to describe salmonviewing he turned and wrote distraught on the instructional board beside it he wrote distracted  jonas nearing his home now smiled at the recollection thinking still as he wheeled his bike into its narrow port beside the door he realized that frightened was the wrong word to describe his feelings now that december was almost here it was too strong an adjective  he had waited a long time for this special december now that it was almost upon him he wasnt frightened but he was    eager he decided he was eager for it to come and he was excited certainly all of the elevens were excited about the event that would be coming so soon  but there was a little shudder of nervousness when he thought about it about what might happen  apprehensive jonas decided thats what i am      who wants to be the first tonight for feelings jonass father asked at the conclusion of their evening meal  it was one of the rituals the evening telling of feelings sometimes jonas and his sister lily argued over turns over who would get to go first their parents of course were part of the ritual they too told their feelings each evening but like all parentsall adultsthey didnt fight and wheedle for their turn  nor did jonas tonight his feelings were too complicated this evening he wanted to share them but he wasnt eager to begin the process of sifting through his own complicated emotions even with the help that he knew his parents could give  you go lily he said seeing his sister who was much youngeronly a sevenwiggling with impatience in her chair  i felt very angry this afternoon lily announced my childcare group was at the play area and we had a visiting group of sevens and they didnt obey the rules at all one of thema male i dont know his namekept going right to the front of the line for the slide even though the rest of us were all waiting i felt so angry at him i made my hand into a fist like this she held up a clenched fist and the rest of the family smiled at her small defiant gesture  why do you think the visitors didnt obey the rules mother asked  lily considered and shook her head i dont know they acted like    like     animals jonas suggested he laughed  thats right lily said laughing too like animals neither child knew what the word meant exactly but it was often used to describe someone uneducated or clumsy someone who didnt fit in  where were the visitors from father asked  lily frowned trying to remember our leader told us when he made the welcome speech but i cant remember i guess i wasnt paying attention it was from another community they had to leave very early and they had their midday meal on the bus  mother nodded do you think its possible that their rules may be different and so they simply didnt know what your play area rules were  lily shrugged and nodded i suppose  youve visited other communities havent you jonas asked my group has often  lily nodded again when we were sixes we went and shared a whole school day with a group of sixes in their community  how did you feel when you were there  lily frowned i felt strange because their methods were different they were learning usages that my group hadnt learned yet so we felt stupid  father was listening with interest im thinking lily he said about the boy who didnt obey the rules today do you think its possible that he felt strange and stupid being in a new place with rules that he didnt know about  lily pondered that yes she said finally  i feel a little sorry for him jonas said even though i dont even know him i feel sorry for anyone who is in a place where he feels strange and stupid  how do you feel now lily father asked still angry  i guess not lily decided i guess i feel a little sorry for him and sorry i made a fist she grinned  jonas smiled back at his sister lilys feelings were always straightforward fairly simple usually easy to resolve he guessed that his own had been too when he was a seven  he listened politely though not very attentively while his father took his turn describing a feeling of worry that hed had that day at work a concern about one of the newchildren who wasnt doing well jonass fathers title was nurturer he and the other nurturers were responsible for all the physical and emotional needs of every newchild during its earliest life it was a very important job jonas knew but it wasnt one that interested him much  what gender is it lily asked  male father said hes a sweet little male with a lovely disposition but he isnt growing as fast as he should and he doesnt sleep soundly we have him in the extra care section for supplementary nurturing but the committees beginning to talk about releasing him  oh no mother murmured sympathetically i know how sad that must make you feel  jonas and lily both nodded sympathetically as well release of newchildren was always sad because they hadnt had a chance to enjoy life within the community yet and they hadnt done anything wrong  there were only two occasions of release which were not punishment release of the elderly which was a time of celebration for a life well and fully lived and release of a newchild which always brought a sense of whatcouldwehavedone this was especially troubling for the nurturers like father who felt they had failed somehow but it happened very rarely  well father said im going to keep trying i may ask the committee for permission to bring him here at night if you dont mind you know what the nightcrew nurturers are like i think this little guy needs something extra  of course mother said and jonas and lily nodded they had heard father complain about the night crew before it was a lesser job nightcrew nurturing assigned to those who lacked the interest or skills or insight for the more vital jobs of the daytime hours most of the people on the night crew had not even been given spouses because they lacked somehow the essential capacity to connect to others which was required for the creation of a family unit  maybe we could even keep him lily suggested sweetly trying to look innocent the look was fake jonas knew they all knew  lily mother reminded her smiling you know the rules  two childrenone male one femaleto each family unit it was written very clearly in the rules  lily giggled well she said i thought maybe just this once      next mother who held a prominent position at the department of justice talked about her feelings today a repeat offender had been brought before her someone who had broken the rules before someone who she hoped had been adequately and fairly punished and who had been restored to his place to his job his home his family unit to see him brought before her a second time caused her overwhelming feelings of frustration and anger and even guilt that she hadnt made a difference in his life  i feel frightened too for him she confessed you know that theres no third chance the rules say that if theres a third transgression he simply has to be released jonas shivered he knew it happened there was even a boy in his group of elevens whose father had been released years before no one ever mentioned it the disgrace was unspeakable it was hard to imagine  lily stood up and went to her mother she stroked her mothers arm  from his place at the table father reached over and took her hand jonas reached for the other  one by one they comforted her soon she smiled thanked them and murmured that she felt soothed  the ritual continued jonas father asked youre last tonight  jonas sighed this evening he almost would have preferred to keep his feelings hidden but it was of course against the rules  im feeling apprehensive he confessed glad that the appropriate descriptive word had finally come to him  why is that son his father looked concerned  i know theres really nothing to worry about jonas explained and that every adult has been through it i know you have father and you too mother but its the ceremony that im apprehensive about its almost december  lily looked up her eyes wide the ceremony of twelve she whispered in an awed voice even the smallest childrenlilys age and youngerknew that it lay in the future for each of them  im glad you told us of your feelings father said  lily mother said beckoning to the little girl go on now and get into your nightclothes father and i are going to stay here and talk to jonas for a while  lily sighed but obediently she got down from her chair privately she asked  mother nodded yes she said this talk will be a private one with jonas      two   jonas watched as his father poured a fresh cup of coffee he waited  you know his father finally said every december was exciting to me when i was young and it has been for you and lily too im sure each december brings such changes  jonas nodded he could remember the decembers back to when he had become well probably a four the earlier ones were lost to him but he observed them each year and he remembered lilys earliest decembers he remembered when his family received lily the day she was named the day that she had become a one  the ceremony for the ones was always noisy and fun each december all the newchildren born in the previous year turned one one at a timethere were always fifty in each years group if none had been releasedthey had been brought to the stage by the nurturers who had cared for them since birth some were already walking wobbly on their unsteady legs others were no more than a few days old wrapped in blankets held by their nurturers  i enjoy the naming jonas said  his mother agreed smiling the year we got lily we knew of course that wed receive our female because wed made our application and been approved but id been wondering and wondering what her name would be  i could have sneaked a look at the list prior to the ceremony father confided the committee always makes the list in advance and its right there in the office at the nurturing center  as a matter of fact he went on i feel a little guilty about this but i did go in this afternoon and looked to see if this years naming list had been made yet it was right there in the office and i looked up number thirtysixthats the little guy ive been concerned aboutbecause it occurred to me that it might enhance his nurturing if i could call him by a name just privately of course when no one else is around  did you find it jonas asked he was fascinated it didnt seem a terribly important rule but the fact that his father had broken a rule at all awed him he glanced at his mother the one responsible for adherence to the rules and was relieved that she was smiling  his father nodded his nameif he makes it to the naming without being released of courseis to be gabriel so i whisper that to him when i feed him every four hours and during exercise and playtime if no one can hear me  i call him gabe actually he said and grinned  gabe jonas tried it out a good name he decided  though jonas had only become a five the year that they acquired lily and learned her name he remembered the excitement the conversations at home wondering about her how she would look who she would be how she would fit into their established family unit he remembered climbing the steps to the stage with his parents his father by his side that year instead of with the nurturers since it was the year that he would be given a newchild of his own  he remembered his mother taking the newchild his sister into her arms while the document was read to the assembled family units newchild twentythree the namer had read lily  he remembered his fathers look of delight and that his father had whispered shes one of my favorites i was hoping for her to be the one the crowd had clapped and jonas had grinned he liked his sisters name lily barely awake had waved her small fist then they had stepped down to make room for the next family unit  when i was an eleven his father said now as you are jonas i was very impatient waiting for the ceremony of twelve its a long two days i remember that i enjoyed the ones as i always do but that i didnt pay much attention to the other ceremonies except for my sisters she became a nine that year and got her bicycle id been teaching her to ride mine even though technically i wasnt supposed to  jonas laughed it was one of the few rules that was not taken very seriously and was almost always broken the children all received their bicycles at nine they were not allowed to ride bicycles before then but almost always the older brothers and sisters had secretly taught the younger ones jonas had been thinking already about teaching lily  there was talk about changing the rule and giving the bicycles at an earlier age a committee was studying the idea when something went to a committee for study the people always joked about it they said that the committee members would become elders by the time the rule change was made  rules were very hard to change sometimes if it was a very important ruleunlike the one governing the age for bicyclesit would have to go eventually to the receiver for a decision the receiver was the most important elder jonas had never even seen him that he knew of someone in a position of such importance lived and worked alone but the committee would never bother the receiver with a question about bicycles they would simply fret and argue about it themselves for years until the citizens forgot that it had ever gone to them for study  his father continued so i watched and cheered when my sister katya became a nine and removed her hair ribbons and got her bicycle father went on then i didnt pay much attention to the tens and elevens and finally at the end of the second day which seemed to go on forever it was my turn it was the ceremony of twelve  jonas shivered he pictured his father who must have been a shy and quiet boy for he was a shy and quiet man seated with his group waiting to be called to the stage the ceremony of twelve was the last of the ceremonies the most important  i remember how proud my parents lookedand my sister too even though she wanted to be out riding the bicycle publicly she stopped fidgeting and was very still and attentive when my turn came  but to be honest jonas his father said for me there was not the element of suspense that there is with your ceremony because i was already fairly certain of what my assignment was to be  jonas was surprised there was no way really to know in advance it was a secret selection made by the leaders of the community the committee of elders who took the responsibility so seriously that there were never even any jokes made about assignments  his mother seemed surprised too how could you have known she asked  his father smiled his gentle smile well it was clear to meand my parents later confessed that it had been obvious to them toowhat my aptitude was i had always loved the newchildren more than anything when my friends in my age group were holding bicycle races or building toy vehicles or bridges with their construction sets or  all the things i do with my friends jonas pointed out and his mother nodded in agreement  i always participated of course because as children we must experience all of those things and i studied hard in school as you do jonas but again and again during free time i found myself drawn to the newchildren i spent almost all of my volunteer hours helping in the nurturing center of course the elders knew that from their observation  jonas nodded during the past year he had been aware of the increasing level of observation in school at recreation time and during volunteer hours he had noticed the elders watching him and the other elevens he had seen them taking notes he knew too that the elders were meeting for long hours with all of the instructors that he and the other elevens had had during their years of school  so i expected it and i was pleased but not at all surprised when my assignment was announced as nurturer father explained  did everyone applaud even though they werent surprised jonas asked  oh of course they were happy for me that my assignment was what i wanted most i felt very fortunate his father smiled  were any of the elevens disappointed your year jonas asked unlike his father he had no idea what his assignment would be but he knew that some would disappoint him though he respected his fathers work nurturer would not be his wish and he didnt envy laborers at all  his father thought no i dont think so of course the elders are so careful in their observations and selections  i think its probably the most important job in our community his mother commented  my friend yoshiko was surprised by her selection as doctor father said but she was thrilled and lets see there was andreii remember that when we were boys he never wanted to do physical things he spent all the recreation time he could with his construction set and his volunteer hours were always on building sites the elders knew that of course andrei was given the assignment of engineer and he was delighted  andrei later designed the bridge that crosses the river to the west of town jonass mother said it wasnt there when we were children  there are very rarely disappointments jonas i dont think you need to worry about that his father reassured him and if there are you know theres an appeal process but they all laughed at thatan appeal went to a committee for study  i worry a little about ashers assignment jonas confessed ashers such fun but he doesnt really have any serious interests he makes a game out of everything  his father chuckled you know he said i remember when asher was a newchild at the nurturing center before he was named he never cried he giggled and laughed at everything all of us on the staff enjoyed nurturing asher  the elders know asher his mother said theyll find exactly the right assignment for him i dont think you need to worry about him but jonas let me warn you about something that may not have occurred to you i know i didnt think about it until after my ceremony of twelve  whats that  well its the last of the ceremonies as you know after twelve age isnt important most of us even lose track of how old we are as time passes though the information is in the hall of open records and we could go and look it up if we wanted to whats important is the preparation for adult life and the training youll receive in your assignment  i know that jonas said everyone knows that  but it means his mother went on that youll move into a new group and each of your friends will youll no longer be spending your time with your group of elevens after the ceremony of twelve youll be with your assignment group with those in training no more volunteer hours no more recreation hours so your friends will no longer be as close  jonas shook his head asher and i will always be friends he said firmly and there will still be school  thats true his father agreed but what your mother said is true as well there will be changes  good changes though his mother pointed out after my ceremony of twelve i missed my childhood recreation but when i entered my training for law and justice i found myself with people who shared my interests i made friends on a new level friends of all ages  did you still play at all after twelve jonas asked  occasionally his mother replied but it didnt seem as important to me  i did his father said laughing i still do every day at the nurturing center i play bounceontheknee and peekaboo and hugtheteddy he reached over and stroked jonass neatly trimmed hair fun doesnt end when you become twelve  lily appeared wearing her nightclothes in the doorway she gave an impatient sigh this is certainly a very long private conversation she said and there are certain people waiting for their comfort object  lily her mother said fondly youre very close to being an eight and when youre an eight your comfort object will be taken away it will be recycled to the younger children you should be starting to go off to sleep without it  but her father had already gone to the shelf and taken down the stuffed elephant which was kept there many of the comfort objects like lilys were soft stuffed imaginary creatures jonass had been called a bear  here you are lilybilly he said ill come help you remove your hair ribbons  jonas and his mother rolled their eyes yet they watched affectionately as lily and her father headed to her sleeping room with the stuffed elephant that had been given to her as her comfort object when she was born his mother moved to her big desk and opened her briefcase her work never seemed to end even when she was at home in the evening jonas went to his own desk and began to sort through his school papers for the evenings assignment but his mind was still on december and the coming ceremony  though he had been reassured by the talk with his parents he hadnt the slightest idea what assignment the elders would be selecting for his future or how he might feel about it when the day came      three   oh look lily squealed in delight isnt he cute look how tiny he is and he has funny eyes like yours jonas jonas glared at her he didnt like it that she had mentioned his eyes he waited for his father to chastise lily but father was busy unstrapping the carrying basket from the back of his bicycle jonas walked over to look  it was the first thing jonas noticed as he looked at the newchild peering up curiously from the basket the pale eyes  almost every citizen in the community had dark eyes his parents did and lily did and so did all of his group members and friends but there were a few exceptions jonas himself and a female five who he had noticed had the different lighter eyes no one mentioned such things it was not a rule but was considered rude to call attention to things that were unsettling or different about individuals lily he decided would have to learn that soon or she would be called in for chastisement because of her insensitive chatter  father put his bike into its port then he picked up the basket and carried it into the house lily followed behind but she glanced back over her shoulder at jonas and teased maybe he had the same birthmother as you  jonas shrugged he followed them inside but he had been startled by the newchilds eyes mirrors were rare in the community they werent forbidden but there was no real need of them and jonas had simply never bothered to look at himself very often even when he found himself in a location where a mirror existed now seeing the newchild and its expression he was reminded that the light eyes were not only a rarity but gave the one who had them a certain lookwhat was it depth he decided as if one were looking into the clear water of the river down to the bottom where things might lurk which hadnt been discovered yet he felt selfconscious realizing that he too had that look  he went to his desk pretending not to be interested in the newchild on the other side of the room mother and lily were bending over to watch as father unwrapped its blanket  whats his comfort object called lily asked picking up the stuffed creature which had been placed beside the newchild in his basket  father glanced at it hippo he said  lily giggled at the strange word hippo she repeated and put the comfort object down again she peered at the unwrapped newchild who waved his arms  i think newchildren are so cute lily sighed i hope i get assigned to be a birthmother  lily mother spoke very sharply dont say that theres very little honor in that assignment  but i was talking to natasha you know the ten who lives around the corner she does some of her volunteer hours at the birthing center and she told me that the birthmothers get wonderful food and they have very gentle exercise periods and most of the time they just play games and amuse themselves while theyre waiting i think id like that lily said petulantly  three years mother told her firmly three births and thats all after that they are laborers for the rest of their adult lives until the day that they enter the house of the old is that what you want lily three lazy years and then hard physical labor until you are old  well no i guess not lily acknowledged reluctantly  father turned the newchild onto his tummy in the basket he sat beside it and rubbed its small back with a rhythmic motion anyway lilybilly he said affectionately the birthmothers never even get to see newchildren if you enjoy the little ones so much you should hope for an assignment as nurturer  when youre an eight and start your volunteer hours you can try some at the nurturing center mother suggested  yes i think i will lily said she knelt beside the basket what did you say his name is gabriel hello gabriel she said in a singsong voice then she giggled oops she whispered i think hes alseep i guess id better be quiet  jonas turned to the school assignments on his desk some chance of that he thought lily was never quiet probably she should hope for an assignment as speaker so that she could sit in the office with the microphone all day making announcements he laughed silently to himself picturing his sister droning on in the selfimportant voice that all the speakers seemed to develop saying things like attention this is a reminder to females under nine that hair ribbons are to be neatly tied at all times  he turned toward lily and noticed to his satisfaction that her ribbons were as usual undone and dangling there would be an announcement like that quite soon he felt certain and it would be directed mainly at lily though her name of course would not be mentioned everyone would know  everyone had known he remembered with humiliation that the announcement attention this is a reminder to male elevens that objects are not to be removed from the recreation area and that snacks are to be eaten not hoarded had been specifically directed at him the day last month that he had taken an apple home no one had mentioned it not even his parents because the public announcement had been sufficient to produce the appropriate remorse he had of course disposed of the apple and made his apology to the recreation director the next morning before school  jonas thought again about that incident he was still bewildered by it not by the announcement or the necessary apology those were standard procedures and he had deserved thembut by the incident itself he probably should have brought up his feeling of bewilderment that very evening when the family unit had shared their feelings of the day but he had not been able to sort out and put words to the source of his confusion so he had let it pass  it had happened during the recreation period when he had been playing with asher jonas had casually picked up an apple from the basket where the snacks were kept and had thrown it to his friend asher had thrown it back and they had begun a simple game of catch  there had been nothing special about it it was an activity that he had performed countless times throw catch throw catch it was effortless for jonas and even boring though asher enjoyed it and playing catch was a required activity for asher because it would improve his handeye coordination which was not up to standards  but suddenly jonas had noticed following the path of the apple through the air with his eyes that the piece of fruit hadwell this was the part that he couldnt adequately understandthe apple had changed just for an instant it had changed in midair he remembered then it was in his hand and he looked at it carefully but it was the same apple unchanged the same size and shape a perfect sphere the same nondescript shade about the same shade as his own tunic  there was absolutely nothing remarkable about that apple he had tossed it back and forth between his hands a few times then thrown it again to asher and againin the air for an instant onlyit had changed  it had happened four times jonas had blinked looked around and then tested his eyesight squinting at the small print on the identification badge attached to his tunic he read his name quite clearly he could also clearly see asher at the other end of the throwing area and he had had no problem catching the apple  jonas had been completely mystified  ash he had called does anything seem strange to you about the apple  yes asher called back laughing it jumps out of my hand onto the ground asher had just dropped it once again  so jonas laughed too and with his laughter tried to ignore his uneasy conviction that something had happened but he had taken the apple home against the recreation area rules that evening before his parents and lily arrived at the dwelling he had held it in his hands and looked at it carefully it was slightly bruised now because asher had dropped it several times but there was nothing at all unusual about the apple  he had held a magnifying glass to it he had tossed it several times across the room watching and then rolled it around and around on his desktop waiting for the thing to happen again  but it hadnt the only thing that happened was the announcement later that evening over the speaker the announcement that had singled him out without using his name that had caused both of his parents to glance meaningfully at his desk where the apple still lay  now sitting at his desk staring at his schoolwork as his family hovered over the newchild in its basket he shook his head trying to forget the odd incident he forced himself to arrange his papers and try to study a little before the evening meal the newchild gabriel stirred and whimpered and father spoke softly to lily explaining the feeding procedure as he opened the container that held the formula and equipment  the evening proceeded as all evenings did in the family unit in the dwelling in the community quiet reflective a time for renewal and preparation for the day to come it was different only in the addition to it of the newchild with his pale solemn knowing eyes      four   jonas rode at a leisurely pace glancing at the bikeports beside the buildings to see if he could spot ashers he didnt often do his volunteer hours with his friend because asher frequently fooled around and made serious work a little difficult but now with twelve coming so soon and the volunteer hours ending it didnt seem to matter  the freedom to choose where to spend those hours had always seemed a wonderful luxury to jonas other hours of the day were so carefully regulated  he remembered when he had become an eight as lily would do shortly and had been faced with that freedom of choice the eights always set out on their first volunteer hour a little nervously giggling and staying in groups of friends they almost invariably did their hours on recreation duty first helping with the younger ones in a place where they still felt comfortable but with guidance as they developed selfconfidence and maturity they moved on to other jobs gravitating toward those that would suit their own interests and skills  a male eleven named benjamin had done his entire nearlyfour years in the rehabilitation center working with citizens who had been injured it was rumored that he was as skilled now as the rehabilitation directors themselves and that he had even developed some machines and methods to hasten rehabilitation there was no doubt that benjamin would receive his assignment to that field and would probably be permitted to bypass most of the training  jonas was impressed by the things benjamin had achieved he knew him of course since they had always been groupmates but they had never talked about the boys accomplishments because such a conversation would have been awkward for benjamin there was never any comfortable way to mention or discuss ones successes without breaking the rule against bragging even if one didnt mean to it was a minor rule rather like rudeness punishable only by gentle chastisement but still better to steer clear of an occasion governed by a rule which would be so easy to break  the area of dwellings behind him jonas rode past the community structures hoping to spot ashers bicycle parked beside one of the small factories or office buildings he passed the childcare center where lily stayed after school and the play areas surrounding it he rode through the central plaza and the large auditorium where public meetings were held  jonas slowed and looked at the nametags on the bicycles lined up outside the nurturing center then he checked those outside food distribution it was always fun to help with the deliveries and he hoped he would find his friend there so that they could go together on the daily rounds carrying the cartons of supplies into the dwellings of the community but he finally found ashers bicycleleaning as usual instead of upright in its port as it should have beenat the house of the old  there was only one other childs bicycle there that of a female eleven named fiona jonas liked fiona she was a good student quiet and polite but she had a sense of fun as well and it didnt surprise him that she was working with asher today he parked his bicycle neatly in the port beside theirs and entered the building  hello jonas the attendant at the front desk said she handed him the signup sheet and stamped her own official seal beside his signature all of his volunteer hours would be carefully tabulated at the hall of open records once long ago it was whispered among the children an eleven had arrived at the ceremony of twelve only to hear a public announcement that he had not completed the required number of volunteer hours and would not therefore be given his assignment he had been permitted an additional month in which to complete the hours and then given his assignment privately with no applause no celebration a disgrace that had clouded his entire future  its good to have some volunteers here today the attendant told him we celebrated a release this morning and that always throws the schedule off a little so things get backed up she looked at a printed sheet lets see asher and fiona are helping in the bathing room why dont you join them there you know where it is dont you  jonas nodded thanked her and walked down the long hallway he glanced into the rooms on either side the old were sitting quietly some visiting and talking with one another others doing handwork and simple crafts a few were asleep each room was comfortably furnished the floors covered with thick carpeting it was a serene and slowpaced place unlike the busy centers of manufacture and distribution where the daily work of the community occurred  jonas was glad that he had over the years chosen to do his hours in a variety of places so that he could experience the differences he realized though that not focusing on one area meant he was left with not the slightest ideanot even a guessof what his assignment would be  he laughed softly thinking about the ceremony again jonas he teased himself but he suspected that with the date so near probably all of his friends were too  he passed a caretaker walking slowly with one of the old in the hall hello jonas the young uniformed man said smiling pleasantly the woman beside him whose arm he held was hunched over as she shuffled along in her soft slippers she looked toward jonas and smiled but her dark eyes were clouded and blank he realized she was blind  he entered the bathing room with its warm moist air and scent of cleansing lotions he removed his tunic hung it carefully on a wall hook and put on the volunteers smock that was folded on a shelf  hi jonas asher called from the corner where he was kneeling beside a tub jonas saw fiona nearby at a different tub she looked up and smiled at him but she was busy gently washing a man who lay in the warm water  jonas greeted them and the caretaking attendants at work nearby then he went to the row of padded lounging chairs where others of the old were waiting he had worked here before he knew what to do  your turn larissa he said reading the nametag on the womans robe ill just start the water and then help you up he pressed the button on a nearby empty tub and watched as the warm water flowed in through the many small openings on the sides the tub would be filled in a minute and the water flow would stop automatically  he helped the woman from the chair led her to the tub removed her robe and steadied her with his hand on her arm as she stepped in and lowered herself she leaned back and sighed with pleasure her head on a soft cushioned headrest  comfortable he asked and she nodded her eyes closed jonas squeezed cleansing lotion onto the clean sponge at the edge of the tub and began to wash her frail body  last night he had watched as his father bathed the newchild this was much the same the fragile skin the soothing water the gentle motion of his hand slippery with soap the relaxed peaceful smile on the womans face reminded him of gabriel being bathed  and the nakedness too it was against the rules for children or adults to look at anothers nakedness but the rule did not apply to newchildren or the old jonas was glad it was a nuisance to keep oneself covered while changing for games and the required apology if one had by mistake glimpsed anothers body was always awkward he couldnt see why it was necessary he liked the feeling of safety here in this warm and quiet room he liked the expression of trust on the womans face as she lay in the water unprotected exposed and free  from the corner of his eye he could see his friend fiona help the old man from the tub and tenderly pat his thin naked body dry with an absorbant cloth she helped him into his robe  jonas thought larissa had drifted into sleep as the old often did and he was careful to keep his motions steady and gentle so he wouldnt wake her he was surprised when she spoke her eyes still closed  this morning we celebrated the release of roberto she told him it was wonderful  i knew roberto jonas said i helped with his feeding the last time i was here just a few weeks ago he was a very interesting man  larissa opened her eyes happily they told his whole life before they released him she said they always do but to be honest she whispered with a mischievous look some of the tellings are a little boring ive even seen some of the old fall asleep during tellingswhen they released edna recently did you know edna  jonas shook his head he couldnt recall anyone named edna  well they tried to make her life sound meaningful and of course she added primly all lives are meaningful i dont mean that they arent but edna my goodness she was a birthmother and then she worked in food production for years until she came here she never even had a family unit  larissa lifted her head and looked around to make sure no one else was listening then she confided i dont think edna was very smart  jonas laughed he rinsed her left arm laid it back into the water and began to wash her feet she murmured with pleasure as he massaged her feet with the sponge  but robertos life was wonderful larissa went on after a moment he had been an instructor of elevensyou know how important that isand hed been on the planning committee andgoodness i dont know how he found the timehe also raised two very successful children and he was also the one who did the landscaping design for the central plaza he didnt do the actual labor of course  now your back lean forward and ill help you sit up jonas put his arm around her and supported her as she sat he squeezed the sponge against her back and began to rub her sharpboned shoulders tell me about the celebration  well there was the telling of his life that is always first then the toast we all raised our glasses and cheered we chanted the anthem he made a lovely goodbye speech and several of us made little speeches wishing him well i didnt though ive never been fond of public speaking  he was thrilled you should have seen the look on his face when they let him go  jonas slowed the strokes of his hand on her back thoughtfully larissa he asked what happens when they make the actual release where exactly did roberto go  she lifted her bare wet shoulders in a small shrug i dont know i dont think anybody does except the committee he just bowed to all of us and then walked like they all do through the special door in the releasing room but you should have seen his look pure happiness id call it  jonas grinned i wish id been there to see it  larissa frowned i dont know why they dont let children come not enough room i guess they should enlarge the releasing room  well have to suggest that to the committee maybe theyd study it jonas said slyly and larissa chortled with laughter  right she hooted and jonas helped her from the tub      five   usually at the morning ritual when the family members told their dreams jonas didnt contribute much he rarely dreamed sometimes he awoke with a feeling of fragments afloat in his sleep but he couldnt seem to grasp them and put them together into something worthy of telling at the ritual  but this morning was different he had dreamed very vividly the night before  his mind wandered while lily as usual recounted a lengthy dream this one a frightening one in which she had against the rules been riding her mothers bicycle and been caught by the security guards  they all listened carefully and discussed with lily the warning that the dream had given  thank you for your dream lily jonas said the standard phrase automatically and tried to pay better attention while his mother told of a dream fragment a disquieting scene where she had been chastised for a rule infraction she didnt understand together they agreed that it probably resulted from her feelings when she had reluctantly dealt punishment to the citizen who had broken the major rules a second time  father said that he had had no dreams  gabe father asked looking down at the basket where the newchild lay gurgling after his feeding ready to be taken back to the nurturing center for the day  they all laughed dreamtelling began with threes if newchildren dreamed no one knew  jonas mother asked they always asked though they knew how rarely jonas had a dream to tell  i did dream last night jonas told them he shifted in his chair frowning  good father said tell us  the details arent clear really jonas explained trying to recreate the odd dream in his mind i think i was in the bathing room at the house of the old  thats where you were yesterday father pointed out  jonas nodded but it wasnt really the same there was a tub in the dream but only one and the real bathing room has rows and rows of them but the room in the dream was warm and damp and i had taken off my tunic but hadnt put on the smock so my chest was bare i was perspiring because it was so warm and fiona was there the way she was yesterday  asher too mother asked  jonas shook his head no it was only me and fiona alone in the room standing beside the tub she was laughing but i wasnt i was almost a little angry at her in the dream because she wasnt taking me seriously  seriously about what lily asked  jonas looked at his plate for some reason that he didnt understand he felt slightly embarrassed i think i was trying to convince her that she should get into the tub of water  he paused he knew he had to tell it all that it was not only all right but necessary to tell all of a dream so he forced himself to relate the part that made him uneasy  i wanted her to take off her clothes and get into the tub he explained quickly i wanted to bathe her i had the sponge in my hand but she wouldnt she kept laughing and saying no  he looked up at his parents thats all he said  can you describe the strongest feeling in your dream son father asked  jonas thought about it the details were murky and vague but the feelings were clear and flooded him again now as he thought the wanting he said i knew that she wouldnt and i think i knew that she shouldnt but i wanted it so terribly i could feel the wanting all through me  thank you for your dream jonas mother said after a moment she glanced at father  lily father said its time to leave for school would you walk beside me this morning and keep an eye on the newchilds basket we want to be certain he doesnt wiggle himself loose  jonas began to rise to collect his schoolbooks he thought it surprising that they hadnt talked about his dream at length before the thank you perhaps they found it as confusing as he had  wait jonas mother said gently ill write an apology to your instructor so that you wont have to speak one for being late  he sank back down into his chair puzzled he waved to father and lily as they left the dwelling carrying gabe in his basket he watched while mother tidied the remains of the morning meal and placed the tray by the front door for the collection crew  finally she sat down beside him at the table jonas she said with a smile the feeling you described as the wanting it was your first stirrings father and i have been expecting it to happen to you it happens to everyone it happened to father when he was your age and it happened to me it will happen someday to lily  and very often mother added it begins with a dream  stirrings he had heard the word before he remembered that there was a reference to the stirrings in the book of rules though he didnt remember what it said and now and then the speaker mentioned it attention a reminder that stirrings must be reported in order for treatment to take place  he had always ignored that announcement because he didnt understand it and it had never seemed to apply to him in any way he ignored as most citizens did many of the commands and reminders read by the speaker  do i have to report it he asked his mother  she laughed you did in the dreamtelling thats enough  but what about the treatment the speaker says that treatment must take place jonas felt miserable just when the ceremony was about to happen his ceremony of twelve would he have to go away someplace for treatment just because of a stupid dream  but his mother laughed again in a reassuring affectionate way no no she said its just the pills youre ready for the pills thats all thats the treatment for stirrings  jonas brightened he knew about the pills his parents both took them each morning and some of his friends did he knew once he had been heading off to school with asher both of them on their bikes when ashers father had called from their dwelling doorway you forgot your pill asher asher had groaned goodnaturedly turned his bike and ridden back while jonas waited  it was the sort of thing one didnt ask a friend about because it might have fallen into that uncomfortable category of being different asher took a pill each morning jonas did not always better less rude to talk about things that were the same  now he swallowed the small pill that his mother handed him  thats all he asked  thats all she replied returning the bottle to the cupboard but you mustnt forget ill remind you for the first weeks but then you must do it on your own if you forget the stirrings will come back the dreams of stirrings will come back sometimes the dosage must be adjusted  asher takes them jonas confided  his mother nodded unsurprised many of your groupmates probably do the males at least and they all will soon females too  how long will i have to take them  until you enter the house of the old she explained all of your adult life but it becomes routine after a while you wont even pay much attention to it  she looked at her watch if you leave right now you wont even be late for school hurry along  and thank you again jonas she added as he went to the door for your dream  pedaling rapidly down the path jonas felt oddly proud to have joined those who took the pills for a moment though he remembered the dream again the dream had felt pleasurable though the feelings were confused he thought that he had liked the feelings that his mother had called stirrings he remembered that upon waking he had wanted to feel the stirrings again  then in the same way that his own dwelling slipped away behind him as he rounded a corner on his bicycle the dream slipped away from his thoughts very briefly a little guiltily he tried to grasp it back but the feelings had disappeared the stirrings were gone      six   lily please hold still mother said again  lily standing in front of her fidgeted impatiently i can tie them myself she complained i always have  i know that mother replied straightening the hair ribbons on the little girls braids but i also know that they constantly come loose and more often than not theyre dangling down your back by afternoon today at least we want them to be neatly tied and to stay neatly tied  i dont like hair ribbons im glad i only have to wear them one more year lily said irritably next year i get my bicycle too she added more cheerfully  there are good things each year jonas reminded her this year you get to start your volunteer hours and remember last year when you became a seven you were so happy to get your frontbuttoned jacket  the little girl nodded and looked down at herself at the jacket with its row of large buttons that designated her as a seven fours fives and sixes all wore jackets that fastened down the back so that they would have to help each other dress and would learn interdependence  the frontbuttoned jacket was the first sign of independence the first very visible symbol of growing up the bicycle at nine would be the powerful emblem of moving gradually out into the community away from the protective family unit  lily grinned and wriggled away from her mother and this year you get your assignment she said to jonas in an excited voice i hope you get pilot and that you take me flying  sure i will said jonas and ill get a special little parachute that just fits you and ill take you up to oh maybe twenty thousand feet and open the door and  jonas mother warned  i was only joking jonas groaned i dont want pilot anyway if i get pilot ill put in an appeal  come on mother said she gave lilys ribbons a final tug jonas are you ready did you take your pill i want to get a good seat in the auditorium she prodded lily to the front door and jonas followed  it was a short ride to the auditorium lily waving to her friends from her seat on the back of mothers bicycle jonas stowed his bicycle beside mothers and made his way through the throng to find his group  the entire community attended the ceremony each year for the parents it meant two days holiday from work they sat together in the huge hall children sat with their groups until they went one by one to the stage  father though would not join mother in the audience right away for the earliest ceremony the naming the nurturers brought the newchildren to the stage jonas from his place in the balcony with the elevens searched the auditorium for a glimpse of father it wasnt at all hard to spot the nurturers section at the front coming from it were the wails and howls of the newchildren who sat squirming on the nurturers laps at every other public ceremony the audience was silent and attentive but once a year they all smiled indulgently at the commotion from the little ones waiting to receive their names and families  jonas finally caught his fathers eye and waved father grinned and waved back then held up the hand of the newchild on his lap making it wave too  it wasnt gabriel gabe was back at the nurturing center today being cared for by the night crew he had been given an unusual and special reprieve from the committee and granted an additional year of nurturing before his naming and placement father had gone before the committee with a plea on behalf of gabriel who had not yet gained the weight appropriate to his days of life nor begun to sleep soundly enough at night to be placed with his family unit normally such a newchild would be labeled inadequate and released from the community  instead as a result of fathers plea gabriel had been labeled uncertain and given the additional year he would continue to be nurtured at the center and would spend his nights with jonass family unit each family member including lily had been required to sign a pledge that they would not become attached to this little temporary guest and that they would relinquish him without protest or appeal when he was assigned to his own family unit at next years ceremony  at least jonas thought after gabriel was placed next year they would still see him often because he would be part of the community if he were released they would not see him again ever those who were releasedeven as newchildrenwere sent elsewhere and never returned to the community  father had not had to release a single newchild this year so gabriel would have represented a real failure and sadness even jonas though he didnt hover over the little one the way lily and his father did was glad that gabe had not been released  the first ceremony began right on time and jonas watched as one after another each newchild was given a name and handed by the nurturers to its new family unit for some it was a first child but many came to the stage accompanied by another child beaming with pride to receive a little brother or sister the way jonas had when he was about to be a five  asher poked jonass arm remember when we got phillipa he asked in a loud whisper jonas nodded it had only been last year ashers parents had waited quite a long time before applying for a second child maybe jonas suspected they had been so exhausted by ashers lively foolishness that they had needed a little time  two of their group fiona and another female named thea were missing temporarily waiting with their parents to receive newchildren but it was rare that there was such an age gap between children in a family unit  when her familys ceremony was completed fiona took the seat that had been saved for her in the row ahead of asher and jonas she turned and whispered to them hes cute but i dont like his name very much she made a face and giggled fionas new brother had been named bruno it wasnt a great name jonas thought likewell like gabriel for example but it was okay  the audience applause which was enthusiastic at each naming rose in an exuberant swell when one parental pair glowing with pride took a male newchild and heard him named caleb  this new caleb was a replacement child the couple had lost their first caleb a cheerful little four loss of a child was very very rare the community was extraordinarily safe each citizen watchful and protective of all children but somehow the first little caleb had wandered away unnoticed and had fallen into the river the entire community had performed the ceremony of loss together murmuring the name caleb throughout an entire day less and less frequently softer in volume as the long and somber day went on so that the little four seemed to fade away gradually from everyones consciousness  now at this special naming the community performed the brief murmurofreplacement ceremony repeating the name for the first time since the loss softly and slowly at first then faster and with greater volume as the couple stood on the stage with the newchild sleeping in the mothers arms it was as if the first caleb were returning  another newchild was given the name roberto and jonas remembered that roberto the old had been released only last week but there was no murmurofreplacement ceremony for the new little roberto release was not the same as loss  he sat politely through the ceremonies of two and three and four increasingly bored as he was each year then a break for midday mealserved outdoorsand back again to the seats for the fives sixes sevens and finally last of the first days ceremonies the eights  jonas watched and cheered as lily marched proudly to the stage became an eight and received the identifying jacket that she would wear this year this one with smaller buttons and for the first time pockets indicating that she was mature enough now to keep track of her own small belongings she stood solemnly listening to the speech of firm instructions on the responsibilities of eight and doing volunteer hours for the first time but jonas could see that lily though she seemed attentive was looking longingly at the row of gleaming bicycles which would be presented tomorrow morning to the nines  next year lilybilly jonas thought  it was an exhausting day and even gabriel retrieved in his basket from the nurturing center slept soundly that night  finally it was the morning of the ceremony of twelve      now father sat beside mother in the audience jonas could see them applauding dutifully as the nines one by one wheeled their new bicycles each with its gleaming nametag attached to the back from the stage he knew that his parents cringed a little as he did when fritz who lived in the dwelling next door to theirs received his bike and almost immediately bumped into the podium with it fritz was a very awkward child who had been summoned for chastisement again and again his transgressions were small ones always shoes on the wrong feet schoolwork misplaced failure to study adequately for a quiz but each such error reflected negatively on his parents guidance and infringed on the communitys sense of order and success jonas and his family had not been looking forward to fritzs bicycle which they realized would probably too often be dropped on the front walk instead of wheeled neatly into its port  finally the nines were all resettled in their seats each having wheeled a bicycle outside where it would be waiting for its owner at the end of the day everyone always chuckled and made small jokes when the nines rode home for the first time want me to show you how to ride older friends would call i know youve never been on a bike before but invariably the grinning nines who in technical violation of the rule had been practicing secretly for weeks would mount and ride off in perfect balance training wheels never touching the ground  then the tens jonas never found the ceremony of ten particularly interestingonly timeconsuming as each childs hair was snipped neatly into its distinguishing cut females lost their braids at ten and males too relinquished their long childish hair and took on the more manly short style which exposed their ears  laborers moved quickly to the stage with brooms and swept away the mounds of discarded hair jonas could see the parents of the new tens stir and murmur and he knew that this evening in many dwellings they would be snipping and straightening the hastily done haircuts trimming them into a neater line  elevens it seemed a short time ago that jonas had undergone the ceremony of eleven but he remembered that it was not one of the more interesting ones by eleven one was only waiting to be twelve it was simply a marking of time with no meaningful changes there was new clothing different undergarments for the females whose bodies were beginning to change and longer trousers for the males with a specially shaped pocket for the small calculator that they would use this year in school but those were simply presented in wrapped packages without an accompanying speech  break for midday meal jonas realized he was hungry he and his groupmates congregated by the tables in front of the auditorium and took their packaged food yesterday there had been merriment at lunch a lot of teasing and energy but today the group stood anxiously separate from the other children jonas watched the new nines gravitate toward their waiting bicycles each one admiring his or her nametag he saw the tens stroking their new shortened hair the females shaking their heads to feel the unaccustomed lightness without the heavy braids they had worn so long  i heard about a guy who was absolutely certain he was going to be assigned engineer asher muttered as they ate and instead they gave him sanitation laborer he went out the next day jumped into the river swam across and joined the next community he came to nobody ever saw him again  jonas laughed somebody made that story up ash he said my father said he heard that story when he was a twelve  but asher wasnt reassured he was eyeing the river where it was visible behind the auditorium i cant even swim very well he said my swimming instructor said that i dont have the right boyishness or something  buoyancy jonas corrected him  whatever i dont have it i sink  anyway jonas pointed out have you ever once known of anyonei mean really known for sure asher not just heard a story about itwho joined another community  no asher admitted reluctantly but you can it says so in the rules if you dont fit in you can apply for elsewhere and be released my mother says that once about ten years ago someone applied and was gone the next day then he chuckled she told me that because i was driving her crazy she threatened to apply for elsewhere  she was joking  i know but it was true what she said that someone did that once she said that it was really true here today and gone tomorrow never seen again not even a ceremony of release  jonas shrugged it didnt worry him how could someone not fit in the community was so meticulously ordered the choices so carefully made  even the matching of spouses was given such weighty consideration that sometimes an adult who applied to receive a spouse waited months or even years before a match was approved and announced all of the factorsdisposition energy level intelligence and interestshad to correspond and to interact perfectly jonass mother for example had higher intelligence than his father but his father had a calmer disposition they balanced each other their match which like all matches had been monitored by the committee of elders for three years before they could apply for children had always been a successful one  like the matching of spouses and the naming and placement of newchildren the assignments were scrupulously thought through by the committee of elders  he was certain that his assignment whatever it was to be and ashers too would be the right one for them he only wished that the midday break would conclude that the audience would reenter the auditorium and the suspense would end  as if in answer to his unspoken wish the signal came and the crowd began to move toward the doors      seven   now jonass group had taken a new place in the auditorium trading with the new elevens so that they sat in the very front immediately before the stage  they were arranged by their original numbers the numbers they had been given at birth the numbers were rarely used after the naming but each child knew his number of course sometimes parents used them in irritation at a childs misbehavior indicating that mischief made one unworthy of a name jonas always chuckled when he heard a parent exasperated call sharply to a whining toddler thats enough twentythree  jonas was nineteen he had been the nineteenth newchild born his year it had meant that at his naming he had been already standing and brighteyed soon to walk and talk it had given him a slight advantage the first year or two a little more maturity than many of his groupmates who had been born in the later months of that year but it evened out as it always did by three  after three the children progressed at much the same level though by their first number one could always tell who was a few months older than others in his group technically jonass full number was elevennineteen since there were other nineteens of course in each age group and today now that the new elevens had been advanced this morning there were two elevennineteens at the midday break he had exchanged smiles with the new one a shy female named harriet  but the duplication was only for these few hours very soon he would not be an eleven but a twelve and age would no longer matter he would be an adult like his parents though a new one and untrained still  asher was four and sat now in the row ahead of jonas he would receive his assignment fourth  fiona eighteen was on his left on his other side sat twenty a male named pierre whom jonas didnt like much pierre was very serious not much fun and a worrier and tattletale too have you checked the rules jonas pierre was always whispering solemnly im not sure thats within the rules usually it was some foolish thing that no one cared aboutopening his tunic if it was a day with a breeze taking a brief try on a friends bicycle just to experience the different feel of it  the initial speech at the ceremony of twelve was made by the chief elder the leader of the community who was elected every ten years the speech was much the same each year recollection of the time of childhood and the period of preparation the coming responsibilities of adult life the profound importance of assignment the seriousness of training to come  then the chief elder moved ahead in her speech  this is the time she began looking directly at them when we acknowledge differences you elevens have spent all your years till now learning to fit in to standardize your behavior to curb any impulse that might set you apart from the group  but today we honor your differences they have determined your futures  she began to describe this years group and its variety of personalities though she singled no one out by name she mentioned that there was one who had singular skills at caretaking another who loved newchildren one with unusual scientific aptitude and a fourth for whom physical labor was an obvious pleasure jonas shifted in his seat trying to recognize each reference as one of his groupmates the caretaking skills were no doubt those of fiona on his left he remembered noticing the tenderness with which she had bathed the old probably the one with scientific aptitude was benjamin the male who had devised new important equipment for the rehabilitation center  he heard nothing that he recognized as himself jonas  finally the chief elder paid tribute to the hard work of her committee which had performed the observations so meticulously all year the committee of elders stood and was acknowledged by applause jonas noticed asher yawn slightly covering his mouth politely with his hand  then at last the chief elder called number one to the stage and the assignments began  each announcement was lengthy accompanied by a speech directed at the new twelve jonas tried to pay attention as one smiling happily received her assignment as fish hatchery attendant along with words of praise for her childhood spent doing many volunteer hours there and her obvious interest in the important process of providing nourishment for the community  number oneher name was madelinereturned finally amidst applause to her seat wearing the new badge that designated her fish hatchery attendant jonas was certainly glad that that assignment was taken he wouldnt have wanted it but he gave madeline a smile of congratulation  when two a female named inger received her assignment as birthmother jonas remembered that his mother had called it a job without honor but he thought that the committee had chosen well inger was a nice girl though somewhat lazy and her body was strong she would enjoy the three years of being pampered that would follow her brief training she would give birth easily and well and the task of laborer that would follow would use her strength keep her healthy and impose selfdiscipline inger was smiling when she resumed her seat birthmother was an important job if lacking in prestige  jonas noticed that asher looked nervous he kept turning his head and glancing back at jonas until the group leader had to give him a silent chastisement a motion to sit still and face forward  three isaac was given an assignment as instructor of sixes which obviously pleased him and was well deserved now there were three assignments gone none of them ones that jonas would have likednot that he could have been a birthmother anyway he realized with amusement he tried to sort through the list in his mind the possible assignments that remained but there were so many he gave it up and anyway now it was ashers turn he paid strict attention as his friend went to the stage and stood selfconsciously beside the chief elder  all of us in the community know and enjoy asher the chief elder began asher grinned and scratched one leg with the other foot the audience chuckled softly  when the committee began to consider ashers assignment she went on there were some possibilities that were immediately discarded some that would clearly not have been right for asher  for example she said smiling we did not consider for an instant designating asher an instructor of threes  the audience howled with laughter asher laughed too looking sheepish but pleased at the special attention the instructors of threes were in charge of the acquisition of correct language  in fact the chief elder continued chuckling a little herself we even gave a little thought to some retroactive chastisement for the one who had been ashers instructor of threes so long ago at the meeting where asher was discussed we retold many of the stories that we all remembered from his days of language acquisition  especially she said chuckling the difference between snack and smack remember asher  asher nodded ruefully and the audience laughed aloud jonas did too he remembered though he had been only a three at the time himself  the punishment used for small children was a regulated system of smacks with the discipline wand a thin flexible weapon that stung painfully when it was wielded the childcare specialists were trained very carefully in the discipline methods a quick smack across the hands for a bit of minor misbehavior three sharper smacks on the bare legs for a second offense  poor asher who always talked too fast and mixed up words even as a toddler as a three eager for his juice and crackers at snacktime he one day said smack instead of snack as he stood waiting in line for the morning treat  jonas remembered it clearly he could still see little asher wiggling with impatience in the line he remembered the cheerful voice call out i want my smack  the other threes including jonas had laughed nervously snack they corrected you meant snack asher but the mistake had been made and precision of language was one of the most important tasks of small children asher had asked for a smack  the discipline wand in the hand of the childcare worker whistled as it came down across ashers hands asher whimpered cringed and corrected himself instantly snack he whispered  but the next morning he had done it again and again the following week he couldnt seem to stop though for each lapse the discipline wand came again escalating to a series of painful lashes that left marks on ashers legs eventually for a period of time asher stopped talking altogether when he was a three  for a while the chief elder said relating the story we had a silent asher but he learned  she turned to him with a smile when he began to talk again it was with greater precision and now his lapses are very few his corrections and apologies are very prompt and his good humor is unfailing the audience murmured in agreement ashers cheerful disposition was wellknown throughout the community  asher she lifted her voice to make the official announcement we have given you the assignment of assistant director of recreation  she clipped on his new badge as he stood beside her beaming then he turned and left the stage as the audience cheered when he had taken his seat again the chief elder looked down at him and said the words that she had said now four times and would say to each new twelve somehow she gave it special meaning for each of them  asher she said thank you for your childhood      the assignments continued and jonas watched and listened relieved now by the wonderful assignment his best friend had been given but he was more and more apprehensive as his own approached now the new twelves in the row ahead had all received their badges they were fingering them as they sat and jonas knew that each one was thinking about the training that lay ahead for someone studious male had been selected as doctor a female as engineer and another for law and justiceit would be years of hard work and study others like laborers and birthmothers would have a much shorter training period  eighteen fiona on his left was called jonas knew she must be nervous but fiona was a calm female she had been sitting quietly serenely throughout the ceremony  even the applause though enthusiastic seemed serene when fiona was given the important assignment of caretaker of the old it was perfect for such a sensitive gentle girl and her smile was satisfied and pleased when she took her seat beside him again  jonas prepared himself to walk to the stage when the applause ended and the chief elder picked up the next folder and looked down to the group to call forward the next new twelve he was calm now that his turn had come he took a deep breath and smoothed his hair with his hand  twenty he heard her voice say clearly pierre  she skipped me jonas thought stunned had he heard wrong no there was a sudden hush in the crowd and he knew that the entire community realized that the chief elder had moved from eighteen to twenty leaving a gap on his right pierre with a startled look rose from his seat and moved to the stage  a mistake she made a mistake but jonas knew even as he had the thought that she hadnt the chief elder made no mistakes not at the ceremony of twelve  he felt dizzy and couldnt focus his attention he didnt hear what assignment pierre received and was only dimly aware of the applause as the boy returned wearing his new badge then twentyone twentytwo  the numbers continued in order jonas sat dazed as they moved into the thirties and then the forties nearing the end each time at each announcement his heart jumped for a moment and he thought wild thoughts perhaps now she would call his name could he have forgotten his own number no he had always been nineteen he was sitting in the seat marked nineteen  but she had skipped him he saw the others in his group glance at him embarrassed and then avert their eyes quickly he saw a worried look on the face of his group leader  he hunched his shoulders and tried to make himself smaller in the seat he wanted to disappear to fade away not to exist he didnt dare to turn and find his parents in the crowd he couldnt bear to see their faces darkened with shame  jonas bowed his head and searched through his mind what had he done wrong      eight   the audience was clearly ill at ease they applauded at the final assignment but the applause was piecemeal no longer a crescendo of united enthusiasm there were murmurs of confusion  jonas moved his hands together clapping but it was an automatic meaningless gesture that he wasnt even aware of his mind had shut out all of the earlier emotions the anticipation excitement pride and even the happy kinship with his friends now he felt only humiliation and terror  the chief elder waited until the uneasy applause subsided then she spoke again  i know she said in her vibrant gracious voice that you are all concerned that you feel i have made a mistake  she smiled the community relieved from its discomfort very slightly by her benign statement seemed to breathe more easily it was very silent  jonas looked up  i have caused you anxiety she said i apologize to my community her voice flowed over the assembled crowd  we accept your apology they all uttered together  jonas she said looking down at him i apologize to you in particular i caused you anguish  i accept your apology jonas replied shakily  please come to the stage now  earlier that day dressing in his own dwelling he had practiced the kind of jaunty selfassured walk that he hoped he could make to the stage when his turn came all of that was forgotten now he simply willed himself to stand to move his feet that felt weighted and clumsy to go forward up the steps and across the platform until he stood at her side  reassuringly she placed her arm across his tense shoulders  jonas has not been assigned she informed the crowd and his heart sank  then she went on jonas has been selected  he blinked what did that mean he felt a collective questioning stir from the audience they too were puzzled  in a firm commanding voice she announced jonas has been selected to be our next receiver of memory  then he heard the gaspthe sudden intake of breath drawn sharply in astonishment by each of the seated citizens he saw their faces the eyes widened in awe  and still he did not understand  such a selection is very very rare the chief elder told the audience our community has only one receiver it is he who trains his successor  we have had our current receiver for a very long time she went on jonas followed her eyes and saw that she was looking at one of the elders the committee of elders was sitting together in a group and the chief elders eyes were now on one who sat in the midst but seemed oddly separate from them it was a man jonas had never noticed before a bearded man with pale eyes he was watching jonas intently  we failed in our last selection the chief elder said solemnly it was ten years ago when jonas was just a toddler i will not dwell on the experience because it causes us all terrible discomfort  jonas didnt know what she was referring to but he could sense the discomfort of the audience they shifted uneasily in their seats  we have not been hasty this time she continued we could not afford another failure  sometimes she went on speaking now in a lighter tone relaxing the tension in the auditorium we are not entirely certain about the assignments even after the most painstaking observations sometimes we worry that the one assigned might not develop through training every attribute necessary elevens are still children after all what we observe as playfulness and patiencethe requirements to become nurturercould with maturity be revealed as simply foolishness and indolence so we continue to observe during training and to modify behavior when necessary  but the receiverintraining cannot be observed cannot be modified that is stated quite clearly in the rules he is to be alone apart while he is prepared by the current receiver for the job which is the most honored in our community  alone apart jonas listened with increasing unease  therefore the selection must be sound it must be a unanimous choice of the committee they can have no doubts however fleeting if during the process an elder reports a dream of uncertainty that dream has the power to set a candidate aside instantly  jonas was identified as a possible receiver many years ago we have observed him meticulously there were no dreams of uncertainty  he has shown all of the qualities that a receiver must have  with her hand still firmly on his shoulder the chief elder listed the qualities  intelligence she said we are all aware that jonas has been a top student throughout his school days  integrity she said next jonas has like all of us committed minor transgressions she smiled at him we expect that we hoped also that he would present himself promptly for chastisement and he has always done so  courage she went on only one of us here today has ever undergone the rigorous training required of a receiver he of course is the most important member of the committee the current receiver it was he who reminded us again and again of the courage required  jonas she said turning to him but speaking in a voice that the entire community could hear the training required of you involves pain physical pain  he felt fear flutter within him  you have never experienced that yes you have scraped your knees in falls from your bicycle yes you crushed your finger in a door last year  jonas nodded agreeing as he recalled the incident and its accompanying misery  but you will be faced now she explained gently with pain of a magnitude that none of us here can comprehend because it is beyond our experience the receiver himself was not able to describe it only to remind us that you would be faced with it that you would need immense courage we cannot prepare you for that  but we feel certain that you are brave she said to him  he did not feel brave at all not now  the fourth essential attribute the chief elder said is wisdom jonas has not yet acquired that the acquisition of wisdom will come through his training  we are convinced that jonas has the ability to acquire wisdom that is what we looked for  finally the receiver must have one more quality and it is one which i can only name but not describe i do not understand it you members of the community will not understand it either perhaps jonas will because the current receiver has told us that jonas already has this quality he calls it the capacity to see beyond  the chief elder looked at jonas with a question in her eyes the audience watched him too they were silent  for a moment he froze consumed with despair he didnt have it the whatevershehadsaid he didnt know what it was now was the moment when he would have to confess to say no i dont i cant and throw himself on their mercy ask their forgiveness to explain that he had been wrongly chosen that he was not the right one at all  but when he looked out across the crowd the sea of faces the thing happened again the thing that had happened with the apple  they changed  he blinked and it was gone his shoulders straightened slightly briefly he felt a tiny sliver of sureness for the first time  she was still watching him they all were  i think its true he told the chief elder and the community i dont understand it yet i dont know what it is but sometimes i see something and maybe its beyond  she took her arm from his shoulders  jonas she said speaking not to him alone but to the entire community of which he was a part you will be trained to be our next receiver of memory we thank you for your childhood  then she turned and left the stage left him there alone standing and facing the crowd which began spontaneously the collective murmur of his name  jonas it was a whisper at first hushed barely audible jonas jonas  then louder faster jonas jonas jonas  with the chant jonas knew the community was accepting him and his new role giving him life the way they had given it to the newchild caleb his heart swelled with gratitude and pride  but at the same time he was filled with fear he did not know what his selection meant he did not know what he was to become  or what would become of him      nine   now for the first time in his twelve years of life jonas felt separate different he remembered what the chief elder had said that his training would be alone and apart  but his training had not yet begun and already upon leaving the auditorium he felt the apartness holding the folder she had given him he made his way through the throng looking for his family unit and for asher people moved aside for him they watched him he thought he could hear whispers  ash he called spotting his friend near the rows of bicycles ride back with me  sure asher smiled his usual smile friendly and familiar but jonas felt a moment of hesitation from his friend an uncertainty  congratulations asher said  you too jonas replied it was really funny when she told about the smacks you got more applause than almost anybody else  the other new twelves clustered nearby placing their folders carefully into the carrying containers on the backs of the bikes in each dwelling tonight they would be studying the instructions for the beginning of their training each night for years the children had memorized the required lessons for school often yawning with boredom tonight they would all begin eagerly to memorize the rules for their adult assignments  congratulations asher someone called then that hesitation again you too jonas  asher and jonas responded with congratulations to their groupmates jonas saw his parents watching him from the place where their own bicycles were waiting lily had already been strapped into her seat  he waved they waved back smiling but he noticed that lily was watching him solemnly her thumb in her mouth  he rode directly to his dwelling exchanging only small jokes and unimportant remarks with asher  see you in the morning recreation director he called dismounting by his door as asher continued on  right see you asher called back once again there was just a moment when things werent quite the same werent quite as they had always been through the long friendship perhaps he had imagined it things couldnt change with asher  the evening meal was quieter than usual lily chattered about her plans for volunteer work she would begin she said at the nurturing center since she was already an expert at feeding gabriel  i know she added quickly when her father gave her a warning glance i wont mention his name i know im not supposed to know his name  i cant wait for tomorrow to come she said happily  jonas sighed uneasily i can he muttered  youve been greatly honored his mother said your father and i are very proud  its the most important job in the community father said  but just the other night you said that the job of making assignments was the most important  mother nodded this is different its not a job really i never thought never expected she paused theres only one receiver  but the chief elder said that they had made a selection before and that it failed what was she talking about  both of his parents hesitated finally his father described the previous selection it was very much as it was today jonasthe same suspense as one eleven had been passed over when the assignments were given then the announcement when they singled out the one  jonas interrupted what was his name  his mother replied her not his it was a female but we are never to speak the name or to use it again for a newchild  jonas was shocked a name designated nottobespoken indicated the highest degree of disgrace  what happened to her he asked nervously  but his parents looked blank we dont know his father said uncomfortably we never saw her again  a silence fell over the room they looked at each other finally his mother rising from the table said youve been greatly honored jonas greatly honored      alone in his sleepingroom prepared for bed jonas opened his folder at last some of the other twelves he had noticed had been given folders thick with printed pages he imagined benjamin the scientific male in his group beginning to read pages of rules and instructions with relish he pictured fiona smiling her gentle smile as she bent over the lists of duties and methods that she would be required to learn in the days to come  but his own folder was startlingly close to empty inside there was only a single printed sheet he read it twice      receiver of memory      1 go immediately at the end of school hours each day to the annex entrance behind the house of the old and present yourself to the attendant  2 go immediately to your dwelling at the conclusion of training hours each day  3 from this moment you are exempted from rules governing rudeness you may ask any question of any citizen and you will receive answers  4 do not discuss your training with any other member of the community including parents and elders  5 from this moment you are prohibited from dreamtelling  6 except for illness or injury unrelated to your training do not apply for any medication  7 you are not permitted to apply for release  8 you may lie      jonas was stunned what would happen to his friendships his mindless hours playing ball or riding his bike along the river those had been happy and vital times for him were they to be completely taken from him now the simple logistic instructionswhere to go and whenwere expected every twelve had to be told of course where and how and when to report for training but he was a little dismayed that his schedule left no time apparently for recreation  the exemption from rudeness startled him reading it again however he realized that it didnt compel him to be rude it simply allowed him the option he was quite certain he would never take advantage of it he was so completely so thoroughly accustomed to courtesy within the community that the thought of asking another citizen an intimate question of calling someones attention to an area of awkwardness was unnerving  the prohibition of dreamtelling he thought would not be a real problem he dreamed so rarely that the dreamtelling did not come easily to him anyway and he was glad to be excused from it he wondered briefly though how to deal with it at the morning meal what if he did dreamshould he simply tell his family unit as he did so often anyway that he hadnt that would be a lie still the final rule said    well he wasnt quite ready to think about the final rule on the page  the restriction of medication unnerved him medication was always available to citizens even to children through their parents when he had crushed his finger in the door he had quickly gasping into the speaker notified his mother she had hastily requisitioned reliefofpain medication which had promptly been delivered to his dwelling almost instantly the excruciating pain in his hand had diminished to the throb which was now all he could recall of the experience  rereading rule number 6 he realized that a crushed finger fell into the category of unrelated to training so if it ever happened againand he was quite certain it wouldnt he had been very careful near heavy doors since the accidenthe could still receive medication  the pill he took now each morning was also unrelated to training so he would continue to receive the pill  but he remembered uneasily what the chief elder had said about the pain that would come with his training she had called it indescribable  jonas swallowed hard trying without success to imagine what such pain might be like with no medication at all but it was beyond his comprehension  he felt no reaction to rule number 7 at all it had never occurred to him that under any circumstances ever he might apply for release  finally he steeled himself to read the final rule again he had been trained since earliest childhood since his earliest learning of language never to lie it was an integral part of the learning of precise speech once when he had been a four he had said just prior to the midday meal at school im starving  immediately he had been taken aside for a brief private lesson in language precision he was not starving it was pointed out he was hungry no one in the community was starving had ever been starving would ever be starving to say starving was to speak a lie an unintentioned lie of course but the reason for precision of language was to ensure that unintentional lies were never uttered did he understand that they asked him and he had  he had never within his memory been tempted to lie asher did not lie lily did not lie his parents did not lie no one did unless     now jonas had a thought that he had never had before this new thought was frightening what if othersadultshad upon becoming twelves received in their instructions the same terrifying sentence  what if they had all been instructed you may lie  his mind reeled now empowered to ask questions of utmost rudenessand promised answershe could conceivably though it was almost unimaginable ask someone some adult his father perhaps do you lie  but he would have no way of knowing if the answer he received were true      ten   i go in here jonas fiona told him when they reached the front door of the house of the old after parking their bicycles in the designated area  i dont know why im nervous she confessed ive been here so often before she turned her folder over in her hands  well everythings different now jonas reminded her  even the nameplates on our bikes fiona laughed during the night the nameplate of each new twelve had been removed by the maintenance crew and replaced with the style that indicated citizenintraining  i dont want to be late she said hastily and started up the steps if we finish at the same time ill ride home with you  jonas nodded waved to her and headed around the building toward the annex a small wing attached to the back he certainly didnt want to be late for his first day of training either  the annex was very ordinary its door unremarkable he reached for the heavy handle then noticed a buzzer on the wall so he buzzed instead  yes the voice came through a small speaker above the buzzer  its uh jonas im the newi mean   come in a click indicated that the door had been unlatched  the lobby was very small and contained only a desk at which a female attendant sat working on some papers she looked up when he entered then to his surprise she stood it was a small thing the standing but no one had ever stood automatically to acknowledge jonass presence before  welcome receiver of memory she said respectfully  oh please he replied uncomfortably call me jonas  she smiled pushed a button and he heard a click that unlocked the door to her left you may go right on in she told him  then she seemed to notice his discomfort and to realize its origin no doors in the community were locked ever none that jonas knew of anyway  the locks are simply to insure the receivers privacy because he needs concentration she explained it would be difficult if citizens wandered in looking for the department of bicycle repair or something  jonas laughed relaxing a little the woman seemed very friendly and it was truein fact it was a joke throughout the communitythat the department of bicycle repair an unimportant little office was relocated so often that no one ever knew where it was  there is nothing dangerous here she told him  but she added glancing at the wall clock he doesnt like to be kept waiting  jonas hurried through the door and found himself in a comfortably furnished living area it was not unlike his own family units dwelling furniture was standard throughout the community practical sturdy the function of each piece clearly defined a bed for sleeping a table for eating a desk for studying  all of those things were in this spacious room though each was slightly different from those in his own dwelling the fabrics on the upholstered chairs and sofa were slightly thicker and more luxurious the table legs were not straight like those at home but slender and curved with a small carved decoration at the foot the bed in an alcove at the far end of the room was draped with a splendid cloth embroidered over its entire surface with intricate designs  but the most conspicuous difference was the books in his own dwelling there were the necessary reference volumes that each household contained a dictionary and the thick community volume which contained descriptions of every office factory building and committee and the book of rules of course  the books in his own dwelling were the only books that jonas had ever seen he had never known that other books existed  but this rooms walls were completely covered by bookcases filled which reached to the ceiling there must have been hundredsperhaps thousandsof books their titles embossed in shiny letters  jonas stared at them he couldnt imagine what the thousands of pages contained could there be rules beyond the rules that governed the community could there be more descriptions of offices and factories and committees  he had only a second to look around because he was aware that the man sitting in a chair beside the table was watching him hastily he moved forward stood before the man bowed slightly and said im jonas  i know welcome receiver of memory  jonas recognized the man he was the elder who had seemed separate from the others at the ceremony though he was dressed in the same special clothing that only elders wore  jonas looked selfconsciously into the pale eyes that mirrored his own  sir i apologize for my lack of understanding     he waited but the man did not give the standard acceptingofapology response  after a moment jonas went on but i thoughti mean i think he corrected reminding himself that if precision of language were ever to be important it was certainly important now in the presence of this man that you are the receiver of memory im only well i was only assigned i mean selected yesterday im not anything at all not yet  the man looked at him thoughtfully silently it was a look that combined interest curiosity concern and perhaps a little sympathy as well  finally he spoke beginning today this moment at least to me you are the receiver  i have been the receiver for a long time a very very long time you can see that cant you  jonas nodded the man was wrinkled and his eyes though piercing in their unusual lightness seemed tired the flesh around them was darkened into shadowed circles  i can see that you are very old jonas responded with respect the old were always given the highest respect  the man smiled he touched the sagging flesh on his own face with amusement i am not actually as old as i look he told jonas this job has aged me i know i look as if i should be scheduled for release very soon but actually i have a good deal of time left  i was pleased though when you were selected it took them a long time the failure of the previous selection was ten years ago and my energy is starting to diminish i need what strength i have remaining for your training we have hard and painful work to do you and i  please sit down he said and gestured toward the nearby chair jonas lowered himself onto the soft cushioned seat  the man closed his eyes and continued speaking when i became a twelve i was selected as you were i was frightened as im sure you are he opened his eyes for a moment and peered at jonas who nodded  the eyes closed again i came to this very room to begin my training it was such a long time ago  the previous receiver seemed just as old to me as i do to you he was just as tired as i am today  he sat forward suddenly opened his eyes and said you may ask questions i have so little experience in describing this process it is forbidden to talk of it  i know sir i have read the instructions jonas said  so i may neglect to make things as clear as i should the man chuckled my job is important and has enormous honor but that does not mean i am perfect and when i tried before to train a successor i failed please ask any questions that will help you  in his mind jonas had questions a thousand a million questions as many questions as there were books lining the walls but he did not ask one not yet  the man sighed seeming to put his thoughts in order then he spoke again simply stated he said although its not really simple at all my job is to transmit to you all the memories i have within me memories of the past  sir jonas said tentatively i would be very interested to hear the story of your life and to listen to your memories  i apologize for interrupting he added quickly  the man waved his hand impatiently no apologies in this room we havent time  well jonas went on uncomfortably aware that he might be interrupting again i am really interested i dont mean that im not but i dont exactly understand why its so important i could do some adult job in the community and in my recreation time i could come and listen to the stories from your childhood id like that actually he added ive done that already in the house of the old the old like to tell about their childhoods and its always fun to listen  the man shook his head no no he said im not being clear its not my past not my childhood that i must transmit to you  he leaned back resting his head against the back of the upholstered chair its the memories of the whole world he said with a sigh before you before me before the previous receiver and generations before him  jonas frowned the whole world he asked i dont understand do you mean not just us not just the community do you mean elsewhere too he tried in his mind to grasp the concept im sorry sir i dont understand exactly maybe im not smart enough i dont know what you mean when you say the whole world or generations before him i thought there was only us i thought there was only now  theres much more theres all that goes beyondall that is elsewhereand all that goes back and back and back i received all of those when i was selected and here in this room all alone i reexperience them again and again it is how wisdom comes and how we shape our future  he rested for a moment breathing deeply i am so weighted with them he said  jonas felt a terrible concern for the man suddenly  its as if    the man paused seeming to search his mind for the right words of description its like going downhill through deep snow on a sled he said finally at first its exhilarating the speed the sharp clear air but then the snow accumulates builds up on the runners and you slow you have to push hard to keep going and   he shook his head suddenly and peered at jonas that meant nothing to you did it he asked  jonas was confused i didnt understand it sir  of course you didnt you dont know what snow is do you  jonas shook his head  or a sled runners  no sir jonas said  downhill the term means nothing to you  nothing sir  well its a place to start id been wondering how to begin move to the bed and lie face down remove your tunic first  jonas did so a little apprehensively beneath his bare chest he felt the soft folds of the magnificent cloth that covered the bed he watched as the man rose and moved first to the wall where the speaker was it was the same sort of speaker that occupied a place in every dwelling but one thing about it was different this one had a switch which the man deftly snapped to the end that said off  jonas almost gasped aloud to have the power to turn the speaker off it was an astonishing thing  then the man moved with surprising quickness to the corner where the bed was he sat on a chair beside jonas who was motionless waiting for what would happen next  close your eyes relax this will not be painful  jonas remembered that he was allowed that he had even been encouraged to ask questions what are you going to do sir he asked hoping that his voice didnt betray his nervousness  i am going to transmit the memory of snow the old man said and placed his hands on jonass bare back      eleven   jonas felt nothing unusual at first he felt only the light touch of the old mans hands on his back  he tried to relax to breathe evenly the room was absolutely silent and for a moment jonas feared that he might disgrace himself now on the first day of his training by falling asleep  then he shivered he realized that the touch of the hands felt suddenly cold at the same instant breathing in he felt the air change and his very breath was cold he licked his lips and in doing so his tongue touched the suddenly chilled air  it was very startling but he was not at all frightened now he was filled with energy and he breathed again feeling the sharp intake of frigid air now too he could feel cold air swirling around his entire body he felt it blow against his hands where they lay at his sides and over his back  the touch of the mans hands seemed to have disappeared  now he became aware of an entirely new sensation pinpricks no because they were soft and without pain tiny cold featherlike feelings peppered his body and face he put out his tongue again and caught one of the dots of cold upon it it disappeared from his awareness instantly but he caught another and another the sensation made him smile  one part of his consciousness knew that he was still lying there on the bed in the annex room yet another separate part of his being was upright now in a sitting position and beneath him he could feel that he was not on the soft decorated bedcovering at all but rather seated on a flat hard surface his hands now held though at the same time they were still motionless at his sides a rough damp rope  and he could see though his eyes were closed he could see a bright whirling torrent of crystals in the air around him and he could see them gather on the backs of his hands like cold fur  his breath was visible  beyond through the swirl of what he now somehow perceived was the thing the old man had spoken ofsnowhe could look out and down a great distance he was up high someplace the ground was thick with the furry snow but he sat slightly above it on a hard flat object  sled he knew abruptly he was sitting on a thing called sled and the sled itself seemed to be poised at the top of a long extended mound that rose from the very land where he was even as he thought the word mound his new consciousness told him hill  then the sled with jonas himself upon it began to move through the snowfall and he understood instantly that now he was going downhill no voice made an explanation the experience explained itself to him  his face cut through the frigid air as he began the descent moving through the substance called snow on the vehicle called sled which propelled itself on what he now knew without doubt to be runners  comprehending all of those things as he sped downward he was free to enjoy the breathless glee that overwhelmed him the speed the clear cold air the total silence the feeling of balance and excitement and peace  then as the angle of incline lessened as the moundthe hillflattened nearing the bottom the sleds forward motion slowed the snow was piled now around it and he pushed with his body moving it forward not wanting the exhilarating ride to end  finally the obstruction of the piled snow was too much for the thin runners of the sled and he came to a stop he sat there for a moment panting holding the rope in his cold hands tentatively he opened his eyesnot his snowhillsled eyes for they had been open throughout the strange ride he opened his ordinary eyes and saw that he was still on the bed that he had not moved at all  the old man still beside the bed was watching him how do you feel he asked  jonas sat up and tried to answer honestly surprised he said after a moment  the old man wiped his forehead with his sleeve whew he said it was exhausting but you know even transmitting that tiny memory to youi think it lightened me just a little  do you meanyou did say i could ask questions  the man nodded encouraging his question  do you mean that now you dont have the memory of itof that ride on the sledanymore  thats right a little weight off this old body  but it was such fun and now you dont have it anymore i took it from you  but the old man laughed all i gave you was one ride on one sled in one snow on one hill i have a whole world of them in my memory i could give them to you one by one a thousand times and there would still be more  are you saying that ii mean wecould do it again jonas asked id really like to i think i could steer by pulling the rope i didnt try this time because it was so new  the old man laughing shook his head maybe another day for a treat but theres no time really just to play i only wanted to begin by showing you how it works  now he said turning businesslike lie back down i want to   jonas did he was eager for whatever experience would come next but he had suddenly so many questions  why dont we have snow and sleds and hills he asked and when did we in the past did my parents have sleds when they were young did you  the old man shrugged and gave a short laugh no he told jonas its a very distant memory thats why it was so exhaustingi had to tug it forward from many generations back it was given to me when i was a new receiver and the previous receiver had to pull it through a long time period too  but what happened to those things snow and the rest of it  climate control snow made growing food difficult limited the agricultural periods and unpredictable weather made transportation almost impossible at times it wasnt a practical thing so it became obsolete when we went to sameness  and hills too he added they made conveyance of goods unwieldy trucks buses slowed them down so  he waved his hand as if a gesture had caused hills to disappear sameness he concluded  jonas frowned i wish we had those things still just now and then  the old man smiled so do i he said but that choice is not ours  but sir jonas suggested since you have so much power   the man corrected him honor he said firmly i have great honor so will you but you will find that that is not the same as power  lie quietly now since weve entered into the topic of climate let me give you something else and this time im not going to tell you the name of it because i want to test the receiving you should be able to perceive the name without being told i gave away snow and sled and downhill and runners by telling them to you in advance  without being instructed jonas closed his eyes again he felt the hands on his back again he waited  now it came more quickly the feelings this time the hands didnt become cold but instead began to feel warm on his body they moistened a little the warmth spread extending across his shoulders up his neck onto the side of his face he could feel it through his clothed parts too a pleasant allover sensation and when he licked his lips this time the air was hot and heavy  he didnt move there was no sled his posture didnt change he was simply alone someplace out of doors lying down and the warmth came from far above it was not as exciting as the ride through the snowy air but it was pleasurable and comforting  suddenly he perceived the word for it sunshine he perceived that it came from the sky  then it ended  sunshine he said aloud opening his eyes  good you did get the word that makes my job easier not so much explaining  and it came from the sky  thats right the old man said just the way it used to  before sameness before climate control jonas added  the man laughed you receive well and learn quickly im very pleased with you thats enough for today i think were off to a good start  there was a question bothering jonas sir he said the chief elder told meshe told everyoneand you told me too that it would be painful so i was a little scared but it didnt hurt at all i really enjoyed it he looked quizzically at the old man  the man sighed i started you with memories of pleasure my previous failure gave me the wisdom to do that he took a few deep breaths jonas he said it will be painful but it need not be painful yet  im brave i really am jonas sat up a little straighter  the old man looked at him for a moment he smiled i can see that he said well since you asked the questioni think i have enough energy for one more transmission  lie down once more this will be the last today  jonas obeyed cheerfully he closed his eyes waiting and felt the hands again then he felt the warmth again the sunshine again coming from the sky of this other consciousness that was so new to him this time as he lay basking in the wonderful warmth he felt the passage of time his real self was aware that it was only a minute or two but his other memoryreceiving self felt hours pass in the sun his skin began to sting restlessly he moved one arm bending it and felt a sharp pain in the crease of his inner arm at the elbow  ouch he said loudly and shifted on the bed owwww he said wincing at the shift and even moving his mouth to speak made his face hurt  he knew there was a word but the pain kept him from grasping it  then it ended he opened his eyes wincing with discomfort it hurt he told the man and i couldnt get the word for it  it was sunburn the old man told him  it hurt a lot jonas said but im glad you gave it to me it was interesting and now i understand better what it meant that there would be pain  the man didnt respond he sat silently for a second finally he said get up now its time for you to go home  they both walked to the center of the room jonas put his tunic back on goodbye sir he said thank you for my first day  the old man nodded to him he looked drained and a little sad  sir jonas said shyly  yes do you have a question  its just that i dont know your name i thought you were the receiver but you say that now im the receiver so i dont know what to call you  the man had sat back down in the comfortable upholstered chair he moved his shoulders around as if to ease away an aching sensation he seemed terribly weary  call me the giver he told jonas      twelve   you slept soundly jonas his mother asked at the morning meal no dreams  jonas simply smiled and nodded not ready to lie not willing to tell the truth i slept very soundly he said  i wish this one would his father said leaning down from his chair to touch gabriels waving fist the basket was on the floor beside him in its corner beside gabriels head the stuffed hippo sat staring with its blank eyes  so do i mother said rolling her eyes hes so fretful at night  jonas had not heard the newchild during the night because as always he had slept soundly but it was not true that he had no dreams  again and again as he slept he had slid down that snowcovered hill always in the dream it seemed as if there were a destination a somethinghe could not grasp whatthat lay beyond the place where the thickness of snow brought the sled to a stop  he was left upon awakening with the feeling that he wanted even somehow needed to reach the something that waited in the distance the feeling that it was good that it was welcoming that it was significant  but he did not know how to get there  he tried to shed the leftover dream gathering his schoolwork and preparing for the day  school seemed a little different today the classes were the same language and communications commerce and industry science and technology civil procedures and government but during the breaks for recreation periods and the midday meal the other new twelves were abuzz with descriptions of their first day of training all of them talked at once interrupting each other hastily making the required apology for interrupting then forgetting again in the excitement of describing the new experiences  jonas listened he was very aware of his own admonition not to discuss his training but it would have been impossible anyway there was no way to describe to his friends what he had experienced there in the annex room how could you describe a sled without describing a hill and snow and how could you describe a hill and snow to someone who had never felt height or wind or that feathery magical cold  even trained for years as they all had been in precision of language what words could you use which would give another the experience of sunshine  so it was easy for jonas to be still and to listen  after school hours he rode again beside fiona to the house of the old  i looked for you yesterday she told him so we could ride home together your bike was still there and i waited for a little while but it was getting late so i went on home  i apologize for making you wait jonas said  i accept your apology she replied automatically  i stayed a little longer than i expected jonas explained  she pedaled forward silently and he knew that she expected him to tell her why she expected him to describe his first day of training but to ask would have fallen into the category of rudeness  youve been doing so many volunteer hours with the old jonas said changing the subject there wont be much that you dont already know  oh theres lots to learn fiona replied theres administrative work and the dietary rules and punishment for disobediencedid you know that they use a discipline wand on the old the same as for small children and theres occupational therapy and recreational activities and medications and   they reached the building and braked their bikes  i really think ill like it better than school fiona confessed  me too jonas agreed wheeling his bike into its place  she waited for a second as if again she expected him to go on then she looked at her watch waved and hurried toward the entrance  jonas stood for a moment beside his bike startled it had happened again the thing that he thought of now as seeing beyond this time it had been fiona who had undergone that fleeting indescribable change as he looked up and toward her going through the door it happened she changed actually jonas thought trying to recreate it in his mind it wasnt fiona in her entirety it seemed to be just her hair and just for that flickering instant  he ran through it in his mind it was clearly beginning to happen more often first the apple a few weeks before the next time had been the faces in the audience at the auditorium just two days ago now today fionas hair  frowning jonas walked toward the annex i will ask the giver he decided  the old man looked up smiling when jonas entered the room he was already seated beside the bed and he seemed more energetic today slightly renewed and glad to see jonas  welcome he said we must get started youre one minute late  i apologi  jonas began and then stopped flustered remembering there were to be no apologies  he removed his tunic and went to the bed im one minute late because something happened he explained and id like to ask you about it if you dont mind  you may ask me anything  jonas tried to sort it out in his mind so that he could explain it clearly i think its what you call seeingbeyond he said  the giver nodded describe it he said  jonas told him about the experience with the apple then the moment on the stage when he had looked out and seen the same phenomenon in the faces of the crowd  then today just now outside it happened with my friend fiona she herself didnt change exactly but something about her changed for a second her hair looked different but not in its shape not in its length i cant quite  jonas paused frustrated by his inability to grasp and describe exactly what had occurred  finally he simply said it changed i dont know how or why  thats why i was one minute late he concluded and looked questioningly at the giver  to his surprise the old man asked him a question which seemed unrelated to the seeingbeyond when i gave you the memory yesterday the first one the ride on the sled did you look around  jonas nodded yes he said but the stuffi mean the snowin the air made it hard to see anything  did you look at the sled  jonas thought back no i only felt it under me i dreamed of it last night too but i dont remember seeing the sled in my dream either just feeling it  the giver seemed to be thinking  when i was observing you before the selection i perceived that you probably had the capacity and what you describe confirms that it happened somewhat differently to me the giver told him when i was just your ageabout to become the new receiveri began to experience it though it took a different form with me it was    well i wont describe that now you wouldnt understand it yet  but i think i can guess how its happening with you let me just make a little test to confirm my guess lie down  jonas lay on the bed again with his hands at his sides he felt comfortable here now he closed his eyes and waited for the familiar feel of the givers hands on his back  but it didnt come instead the giver instructed him call back the memory of the ride on the sled just the beginning of it where youre at the top of the hill before the slide starts and this time look down at the sled  jonas was puzzled he opened his eyes excuse me he asked politely but dont you have to give me the memory  its your memory now its not mine to experience any longer i gave it away  but how can i call it back  you can remember last year or the year that you were a seven or a five cant you  of course  its much the same everyone in the community has onegeneration memories like those but now you will be able to go back farther try just concentrate  jonas closed his eyes again he took a deep breath and sought the sled and the hill and the snow in his consciousness  there they were with no effort he was again sitting in that whirling world of snowflakes atop the hill  jonas grinned with delight and blew his own steamy breath into view then as he had been instructed he looked down he saw his own hands furred again with snow holding the rope he saw his legs and moved them aside for a glimpse of the sled beneath  dumbfounded he stared at it this time it was not a fleeting impression this time the sled hadand continued to have as he blinked and stared at it againthat same mysterious quality that the apple had had so briefly and fionas hair the sled did not change it simply waswhatever the thing was  jonas opened his eyes and was still on the bed the giver was watching him curiously  yes jonas said slowly i saw it in the sled  let me try one more thing look over there to the bookcase do you see the very top row of books the ones behind the table on the top shelf  jonas sought them with his eyes he stared at them and they changed but the change was fleeting it slipped away the next instant  it happened jonas said it happened to the books but it went away again  im right then the giver said youre beginning to see the color red  the what  the giver sighed how to explain this once back in the time of the memories everything had a shape and size the way things still do but they also had a quality called color  there were a lot of colors and one of them was called red thats the one you are starting to see your friend fiona has red hairquite distinctive actually ive noticed it before when you mentioned fionas hair it was the clue that told me you were probably beginning to see the color red  and the faces of people the ones i saw at the ceremony  the giver shook his head no flesh isnt red but it has red tones in it there was a time actuallyyoull see this in the memories laterwhen flesh was many different colors that was before we went to sameness today flesh is all the same and what you saw was the red tones probably when you saw the faces take on color it wasnt as deep or vibrant as the apple or your friends hair  the giver chuckled suddenly weve never completely mastered sameness i suppose the genetic scientists are still hard at work trying to work the kinks out hair like fionas must drive them crazy  jonas listened trying hard to comprehend and the sled he said it had that same thing the color red but it didnt change giver it just was  because its a memory from the time when color was  it was sooh i wish language were more precise the red was so beautiful  the giver nodded it is  do you see it all the time  i see all of them all the colors  will i  of course when you receive the memories you have the capacity to see beyond youll gain wisdom then along with colors and lots more  jonas wasnt interested just then in wisdom it was the colors that fascinated him why cant everyone see them why did colors disappear  the giver shrugged our people made that choice the choice to go to sameness before my time before the previous time back and back and back we relinquished color when we relinquished sunshine and did away with differences he thought for a moment we gained control of many things but we had to let go of others  we shouldnt have jonas said fiercely  the giver looked startled at the certainty of jonass reaction then he smiled wryly youve come very quickly to that conclusion he said it took me many years maybe your wisdom will come much more quickly than mine  he glanced at the wall clock lie back down now we have so much to do  giver jonas asked as he arranged himself again on the bed how did it happen to you when you were becoming the receiver you said that the seeingbeyond happened to you but not the same way  the hands came to his back another day the giver said gently ill tell you another day now we must work and ive thought of a way to help you with the concept of color  close your eyes and be still now im going to give you a memory of a rainbow      thirteen   days went by and weeks jonas learned through the memories the names of colors and now he began to see them all in his ordinary life though he knew it was ordinary no longer and would never be again but they didnt last there would be a glimpse of greenthe landscaped lawn around the central plaza a bush on the riverbank the bright orange of pumpkins being trucked in from the agricultural fields beyond the community boundaryseen in an instant the flash of brilliant color but gone again returning to their flat and hueless shade  the giver told him that it would be a very long time before he had the colors to keep  but i want them jonas said angrily it isnt fair that nothing has color  not fair the giver looked at jonas curiously explain what you mean  well    jonas had to stop and think it through if everythings the same then there arent any choices i want to wake up in the morning and decide things a blue tunic or a red one  he looked down at himself at the colorless fabric of his clothing but its all the same always  then he laughed a little i know its not important what you wear it doesnt matter but   its the choosing thats important isnt it the giver asked him  jonas nodded my little brother  he began and then corrected himself no thats inaccurate hes not my brother not really but this newchild that my family takes care ofhis names gabriel  yes i know about gabriel  well hes right at the age where hes learning so much he grabs toys when we hold them in front of himmy father says hes learning smallmuscle control and hes really cute  the giver nodded  but now that i can see colors at least sometimes i was just thinking what if we could hold up things that were bright red or bright yellow and he could choose instead of the sameness  he might make wrong choices  oh jonas was silent for a minute oh i see what you mean it wouldnt matter for a newchilds toy but later it does matter doesnt it we dont dare to let people make choices of their own  not safe the giver suggested  definitely not safe jonas said with certainty what if they were allowed to choose their own mate and chose wrong  or what if he went on almost laughing at the absurdity they chose their own jobs  frightening isnt it the giver said  jonas chuckled very frightening i cant even imagine it we really have to protect people from wrong choices  its safer  yes jonas agreed much safer  but when the conversation turned to other things jonas was left still with a feeling of frustration that he didnt understand  he found that he was often angry now irrationally angry at his groupmates that they were satisfied with their lives which had none of the vibrance his own was taking on and he was angry at himself that he could not change that for them  he tried without asking permission from the giver because he fearedor knewthat it would be denied he tried to give his new awareness to his friends  asher jonas said one morning look at those flowers very carefully they were standing beside a bed of geraniums planted near the hall of open records he put his hands on ashers shoulders and concentrated on the red of the petals trying to hold it as long as he could and trying at the same time to transmit the awareness of red to his friend  whats the matter asher asked uneasily is something wrong he moved away from jonass hands it was extremely rude for one citizen to touch another outside of family units  no nothing i thought for a minute that they were wilting and we should let the gardening crew know they needed more watering jonas sighed and turned away  one evening he came home from his training weighted with new knowledge the giver had chosen a startling and disturbing memory that day under the touch of his hands jonas had found himself suddenly in a place that was completely alien hot and windswept under a vast blue sky there were tufts of sparse grass a few bushes and rocks and nearby he could see an area of thicker vegetation broad low trees outlined against the sky he could hear noises the sharp crack of weaponshe perceived the word gunsand then shouts and an immense crashing thud as something fell tearing branches from the trees  he heard voices calling to one another peering from the place where he stood hidden behind some shrubbery he was reminded of what the giver had told him that there had been a time when flesh had different colors two of these men had dark brown skin the others were light going closer he watched them hack the tusks from a motionless elephant on the ground and haul them away spattered with blood he felt himself overwhelmed with a new perception of the color he knew as red  then the men were gone speeding toward the horizon in a vehicle that spit pebbles from its whirling tires one hit his forehead and stung him there but the memory continued though jonas ached now for it to end  now he saw another elephant emerge from the place where it had stood hidden in the trees very slowly it walked to the mutilated body and looked down with its sinuous trunk it stroked the huge corpse then it reached up broke some leafy branches with a snap and draped them over the mass of torn thick flesh  finally it tilted its massive head raised its trunk and roared into the empty landscape jonas had never heard such a sound it was a sound of rage and grief and it seemed never to end  he could still hear it when he opened his eyes and lay anguished on the bed where he received the memories it continued to roar into his consciousness as he pedaled slowly home  lily he asked that evening when his sister took her comfort object the stuffed elephant from the shelf did you know that once there really were elephants live ones  she glanced down at the ragged comfort object and grinned right she said skeptically sure jonas  jonas went and sat beside them while his father untied lilys hair ribbons and combed her hair he placed one hand on each of their shoulders with all of his being he tried to give each of them a piece of the memory not of the tortured cry of the elephant but of the being of the elephant of the towering immense creature and the meticulous touch with which it had tended its friend at the end  but his father had continued to comb lilys long hair and lily impatient had finally wiggled under her brothers touch jonas she said youre hurting me with your hand  i apologize for hurting you lily jonas mumbled and took his hand away  cept your apology lily responded indifferently stroking the lifeless elephant      giver jonas asked once as they prepared for the days work dont you have a spouse arent you allowed to apply for one although he was exempted from the rules against rudeness he was aware that this was a rude question but the giver had encouraged all of his questions not seeming to be embarrassed or offended by even the most personal  the giver chuckled no theres no rule against it and i did have a spouse youre forgetting how old i am jonas my former spouse lives now with the childless adults  oh of course jonas had forgotten the givers obvious age when adults of the community became older their lives became different they were no longer needed to create family units jonass own parents when he and lily were grown would go to live with the childless adults  youll be able to apply for a spouse jonas if you want to ill warn you though that it will be difficult your living arrangements will have to be different from those of most family units because the books are forbidden to citizens you and i are the only ones with access to the books  jonas glanced around at the astonishing array of volumes from time to time now he could see their colors with their hours together his and the givers consumed by conversation and by the transmission of memories jonas had not yet opened any of the books but he read the titles here and there and knew that they contained all of the knowledge of centuries and that one day they would belong to him  so if i have a spouse and maybe children i will have to hide the books from them  the giver nodded i wasnt permitted to share the books with my spouse thats correct and there are other difficulties too you remember the rule that says the new receiver cant talk about his training  jonas nodded of course he remembered it had turned out by far to be the most frustrating of the rules he was required to obey  when you become the official receiver when were finished here youll be given a whole new set of rules those are the rules that i obey and it wont surprise you that i am forbidden to talk about my work to anyone except the new receiver thats you of course  so there will be a whole part of your life which you wont be able to share with a family its hard jonas it was hard for me  you do understand dont you that this is my life the memories  jonas nodded again but he was puzzled didnt life consist of the things you did each day there wasnt anything else really ive seen you taking walks he said  the giver sighed i walk i eat at mealtime and when i am called by the committee of elders i appear before them to give them counsel and advice  do you advise them often jonas was a little frightened at the thought that one day he would be the one to advise the ruling body  but the giver said no rarely only when they are faced with something that they have not experienced before then they call upon me to use the memories and advise them but it very seldom happens sometimes i wish theyd ask for my wisdom more oftenthere are so many things i could tell them things i wish they would change but they dont want change life here is so orderly so predictableso painless its what theyve chosen  i dont know why they even need a receiver then if they never call upon him jonas commented  they need me and you the giver said but didnt explain they were reminded of that ten years ago  what happened ten years ago jonas asked oh i know you tried to train a successor and it failed why why did that remind them  the giver smiled grimly when the new receiver failed the memories that she had received were released they didnt come back to me they went     he paused and seemed to be struggling with the concept i dont know exactly they went to the place where memories once existed before receivers were created someplace out there  he gestured vaguely with his arm and then the people had access to them apparently thats the way it was once everyone had access to memories  it was chaos he said they really suffered for a while finally it subsided as the memories were assimilated but it certainly made them aware of how they need a receiver to contain all that pain and knowledge  but you have to suffer like that all the time jonas pointed out  the giver nodded and you will its my life it will be yours  jonas thought about it about what it would be like for him along with walking and eating and  he looked around the walls of books reading thats it  the giver shook his head those are simply the things that i do my life is here  in this room  the giver shook his head he put his hands to his own face to his chest no here in my being where the memories are  my instructors in science and technology have taught us about how the brain works jonas told him eagerly its full of electrical impulses its like a computer if you stimulate one part of the brain with an electrode it  he stopped talking he could see an odd look on the givers face  they know nothing the giver said bitterly  jonas was shocked since the first day in the annex room they had together disregarded the rules about rudeness and jonas felt comfortable with that now but this was different and far beyond rude this was a terrible accusation what if someone had heard  he glanced quickly at the wall speaker terrified that the committee might be listening as they could at any time but as always during their sessions together the switch had been turned to off  nothing jonas whispered nervously but my instructors   the giver flicked his hand as if brushing something aside oh your instructors are well trained they know their scientific facts everyone is well trained for his job  its just that    without the memories its all meaningless they gave that burden to me and to the previous receiver and the one before him  and back and back and back jonas said knowing the phrase that always came  the giver smiled though his smile was oddly harsh thats right and next it will be you a great honor  yes sir they told me that at the ceremony the very highest honor      some afternoons the giver sent him away without training jonas knew on days when he arrived to find the giver hunched over rocking his body slightly back and forth his face pale that he would be sent away  go the giver would tell him tensely im in pain today come back tomorrow  on those days worried and disappointed jonas would walk alone beside the river the paths were empty of people except for the few delivery crews and landscape workers here and there small children were all at the childcare center after school and the older ones busy with volunteer hours or training  by himself he tested his own developing memory he watched the landscape for glimpses of the green that he knew was embedded in the shrubbery when it came flickering into his consciousness he focused upon it keeping it there darkening it holding it in his vision as long as possible until his head hurt and he let it fade away  he stared at the flat colorless sky bringing blue from it and remembered sunshine until finally for an instant he could feel warmth  he stood at the foot of the bridge that spanned the river the bridge that citizens were allowed to cross only on official business jonas had crossed it on school trips visiting the outlying communities and he knew that the land beyond the bridge was much the same flat and well ordered with fields for agriculture the other communities he had seen on visits were essentially the same as his own the only differences were slightly altered styles of dwellings slightly different schedules in the schools  he wondered what lay in the far distance where he had never gone the land didnt end beyond those nearby communities were there hills elsewhere were there vast windtorn areas like the place he had seen in memory the place where the elephant died      giver he asked one afternoon following a day when he had been sent away what causes you pain  when the giver was silent jonas continued the chief elder told me at the beginning that the receiving of memory causes terrible pain and you described for me that the failure of the last new receiver released painful memories to the community  but i havent suffered giver not really jonas smiled oh i remember the sunburn you gave me on the very first day but that wasnt so terrible what is it that makes you suffer so much if you gave some of it to me maybe your pain would be less  the giver nodded lie down he said its time i suppose i cant shield you forever youll have to take it all on eventually  let me think he went on when jonas was on the bed waiting a little fearful  all right the giver said after a moment ive decided well start with something familiar lets go once again to a hill and a sled  he placed his hands on jonass back      fourteen   it was much the same this memory though the hill seemed to be a different one steeper and the snow was not falling as thickly as it had before  it was colder also jonas perceived he could see as he sat waiting at the top of the hill that the snow beneath the sled was not thick and soft as it had been before but hard and coated with bluish ice  the sled moved forward and jonas grinned with delight looking forward to the breathtaking slide down through the invigorating air  but the runners this time couldnt slice through the frozen expanse as they had on the other snowcushioned hill they skittered sideways and the sled gathered speed jonas pulled at the rope trying to steer but the steepness and speed took control from his hands and he was no longer enjoying the feeling of freedom but instead terrified was at the mercy of the wild acceleration downward over the ice  sideways spinning the sled hit a bump in the hill and jonas was jarred loose and thrown violently into the air he fell with his leg twisted under him and could hear the crack of bone his face scraped along jagged edges of ice and when he came at last to a stop he lay shocked and still feeling nothing at first but fear  then the first wave of pain he gasped it was as if a hatchet lay lodged in his leg slicing through each nerve with a hot blade in his agony he perceived the word fire and felt flames licking at the torn bone and flesh he tried to move and could not the pain grew  he screamed there was no answer  sobbing he turned his head and vomited onto the frozen snow blood dripped from his face into the vomit  nooooo he cried and the sound disappeared into the empty landscape into the wind  then suddenly he was in the annex room again writhing on the bed his face was wet with tears  able to move now he rocked his own body back and forth breathing deeply to release the remembered pain  he sat and looked at his own leg where it lay straight on the bed unbroken the brutal slice of pain was gone but the leg ached horribly still and his face felt raw  may i have reliefofpain please he begged it was always provided in his everyday life for the bruises and wounds for a mashed finger a stomach ache a skinned knee from a fall from a bike there was always a daub of anesthetic ointment or a pill or in severe instances an injection that brought complete and instantaneous deliverance  but the giver said no and looked away  limping jonas walked home pushing his bicycle that evening the sunburn pain had been so small in comparison and had not stayed with him but this ache lingered  it was not unendurable as the pain on the hill had been jonas tried to be brave he remembered that the chief elder had said he was brave  is something wrong jonas his father asked at the evening meal youre so quiet tonight arent you feeling well would you like some medication  but jonas remembered the rules no medication for anything related to his training  and no discussion of his training at the time for sharingoffeelings he simply said that he felt tired that his school lessons had been unusually demanding that day  he went to his sleepingroom early and from behind the closed door he could hear his parents and sister laughing as they gave gabriel his evening bath  they have never known pain he thought the realization made him feel desperately lonely and he rubbed his throbbing leg he eventually slept again and again he dreamed of the anguish and the isolation on the forsaken hill      the daily training continued and now it always included pain the agony of the fractured leg began to seem no more than a mild discomfort as the giver led jonas firmly little by little into the deep and terrible suffering of the past each time in his kindness the giver ended the afternoon with a colorfilled memory of pleasure a brisk sail on a bluegreen lake a meadow dotted with yellow wildflowers an orange sunset behind mountains  it was not enough to assuage the pain that jonas was beginning now to know  why jonas asked him after he had received a torturous memory in which he had been neglected and unfed the hunger had caused excruciating spasms in his empty distended stomach he lay on the bed aching why do you and i have to hold these memories  it gives us wisdom the giver replied without wisdom i could not fulfill my function of advising the committee of elders when they call upon me  but what wisdom do you get from hunger jonas groaned his stomach still hurt though the memory had ended  some years ago the giver told him before your birth a lot of citizens petitioned the committee of elders they wanted to increase the rate of births they wanted each birthmother to be assigned four births instead of three so that the population would increase and there would be more laborers available  jonas nodded listening that makes sense  the idea was that certain family units could accommodate an additional child  jonas nodded again mine could he pointed out we have gabriel this year and its fun having a third child  the committee of elders sought my advice the giver said it made sense to them too but it was a new idea and they came to me for wisdom  and you used your memories  the giver said yes and the strongest memory that came was hunger it came from many generations back centuries back the population had gotten so big that hunger was everywhere excruciating hunger and starvation it was followed by warfare  warfare it was a concept jonas did not know but hunger was familiar to him now unconsciously he rubbed his own abdomen recalling the pain of its unfulfilled needs so you described that to them  they dont want to hear about pain they just seek the advice i simply advised them against increasing the population  but you said that that was before my birth they hardly ever come to you for advice only when theywhat was it you said when they have a problem theyve never faced before when did it happen last  do you remember the day when the plane flew over the community  yes i was scared  so were they they prepared to shoot it down but they sought my advice i told them to wait  but how did you know how did you know the pilot was lost  i didnt i used my wisdom from the memories i knew that there had been times in the pastterrible timeswhen people had destroyed others in haste in fear and had brought about their own destruction  jonas realized something that means he said slowly that you have memories of destruction and you have to give them to me too because i have to get the wisdom  the giver nodded  but it will hurt jonas said it wasnt a question  it will hurt terribly the giver agreed  but why cant everyone have the memories i think it would seem a little easier if the memories were shared you and i wouldnt have to bear so much by ourselves if everybody took a part  the giver sighed youre right he said but then everyone would be burdened and pained they dont want that and thats the real reason the receiver is so vital to them and so honored they selected meand youto lift that burden from themselves  when did they decide that jonas asked angrily it wasnt fair lets change it  how do you suggest we do that ive never been able to think of a way and im supposed to be the one with all the wisdom  but there are two of us now jonas said eagerly together we can think of something  the giver watched him with a wry smile  why cant we just apply for a change of rules jonas suggested  the giver laughed then jonas too chuckled reluctantly  the decision was made long before my time or yours the giver said and before the previous receiver and  he waited  back and back and back jonas repeated the familiar phrase sometimes it had seemed humorous to him sometimes it had seemed meaningful and important  now it was ominous it meant he knew that nothing could be changed      the newchild gabriel was growing and successfully passed the tests of maturity that the nurturers gave each month he could sit alone now could reach for and grasp small play objects and he had six teeth during the daytime hours father reported he was cheerful and seemed of normal intelligence but he remained fretful at night whimpering often needing frequent attention  after all this extra time ive put in with him father said one evening after gabriel had been bathed and was lying for the moment hugging his hippo placidly in the small crib that had replaced the basket i hope theyre not going to decide to release him  maybe it would be for the best mother suggested i know you dont mind getting up with him at night but the lack of sleep is awfully hard for me  if they release gabriel can we get another newchild as a visitor asked lily she was kneeling beside the crib making funny faces at the little one who was smiling back at her  jonass mother rolled her eyes in dismay  no father said smiling he ruffled lilys hair its very rare anyway that a newchilds status is as uncertain as gabriels it probably wont happen again for a long time  anyway he sighed they wont make the decision for a while right now were all preparing for a release well probably have to make very soon theres a birthmother whos expecting twin males next month  oh dear mother said shaking her head if theyre identical i hope youre not the one assigned   i am im next on the list ill have to select the one to be nurtured and the one to be released its usually not hard though usually its just a matter of birthweight we release the smaller of the two  jonas listening thought suddenly about the bridge and how standing there he had wondered what lay elsewhere was there someone there waiting who would receive the tiny released twin would it grow up elsewhere not knowing ever that in this community lived a being who looked exactly the same  for a moment he felt a tiny fluttering hope that he knew was quite foolish he hoped that it would be larissa waiting larissa the old woman he had bathed he remembered her sparkling eyes her soft voice her low chuckle fiona had told him recently that larissa had been released at a wonderful ceremony  but he knew that the old were not given children to raise larissas life elsewhere would be quiet and serene as befit the old she would not welcome the responsibility of nurturing a newchild who needed feeding and care and would likely cry at night  mother father he said the idea coming to him unexpectedly why dont we put gabriels crib in my room tonight i know how to feed and comfort him and it would let you and father get some sleep  father looked doubtful you sleep so soundly jonas what if his restlessness didnt wake you  it was lily who answered that if no one goes to tend gabriel she pointed out he gets very loud hed wake all of us if jonas slept through it  father laughed youre right lilybilly all right jonas lets try it just for tonight ill take the night off and well let mother get some sleep too      gabriel slept soundly for the earliest part of the night jonas in his bed lay awake for a while from time to time he raised himself on one elbow looking over at the crib the newchild was on his stomach his arms relaxed beside his head his eyes closed and his breathing regular and undisturbed finally jonas slept too  then as the middle hours of the night approached the noise of gabes restlessness woke jonas the newchild was turning under his cover flailing his arms and beginning to whimper  jonas rose and went to him gently he patted gabriels back sometimes that was all it took to lull him back to sleep but the newchild still squirmed fretfully under his hand  still patting rhythmically jonas began to remember the wonderful sail that the giver had given him not long before a bright breezy day on a clear turquoise lake and above him the white sail of the boat billowing as he moved along in the brisk wind  he was not aware of giving the memory but suddenly he realized that it was becoming dimmer that it was sliding through his hand into the being of the newchild gabriel became quiet startled jonas pulled back what was left of the memory with a burst of will he removed his hand from the little back and stood quietly beside the crib  to himself he called the memory of the sail forward again it was still there but the sky was less blue the gentle motion of the boat slower the water of the lake more murky and clouded he kept it for a while soothing his own nervousness at what had occurred then let it go and returned to his bed  once more toward dawn the newchild woke and cried out again jonas went to him this time he quite deliberately placed his hand firmly on gabriels back and released the rest of the calming day on the lake again gabriel slept  but now jonas lay awake thinking he no longer had any more than a wisp of the memory and he felt a small lack where it had been he could ask the giver for another sail he knew a sail perhaps on ocean next time for jonas had a memory of ocean now and knew what it was he knew that there were sailboats there too in memories yet to be acquired  he wondered though if he should confess to the giver that he had given a memory away he was not yet qualified to be a giver himself nor had gabriel been selected to be a receiver  that he had this power frightened him he decided not to tell      fifteen   jonas entered the annex room and realized immediately that it was a day when he would be sent away the giver was rigid in his chair his face in his hands  ill come back tomorrow sir he said quickly then he hesitated unless maybe theres something i can do to help  the giver looked up at him his face contorted with suffering please he gasped take some of the pain  jonas helped him to his chair at the side of the bed then he quickly removed his tunic and lay face down put your hands on me he directed aware that in such anguish the giver might need reminding  the hands came and the pain came with them and through them jonas braced himself and entered the memory which was torturing the giver  he was in a confused noisy foulsmelling place it was daylight early morning and the air was thick with smoke that hung yellow and brown above the ground around him everywhere far across the expanse of what seemed to be a field lay groaning men a wildeyed horse its bridle torn and dangling trotted frantically through the mounds of men tossing its head whinnying in panic it stumbled finally then fell and did not rise  jonas heard a voice next to him water the voice said in a parched croaking whisper  he turned his head toward the voice and looked into the halfclosed eyes of a boy who seemed not much older than himself dirt streaked the boys face and his matted blond hair he lay sprawled his gray uniform glistening with wet fresh blood  the colors of the carnage were grotesquely bright the crimson wetness on the rough and dusty fabric the ripped shreds of grass startlingly green in the boys yellow hair  the boy stared at him water he begged again when he spoke a new spurt of blood drenched the coarse cloth across his chest and sleeve  one of jonass arms was immobilized with pain and he could see through his own torn sleeve something that looked like ragged flesh and splintery bone he tried his remaining arm and felt it move slowly he reached to his side felt the metal container there and removed its cap stopping the small motion of his hand now and then to wait for the surging pain to ease finally when the container was open he extended his arm slowly across the bloodsoaked earth inch by inch and held it to the lips of the boy water trickled into the imploring mouth and down the grimy chin  the boy sighed his head fell back his lower jaw dropping as if he had been surprised by something a dull blankness slid slowly across his eyes he was silent  but the noise continued all around the cries of the wounded men the cries begging for water and for mother and for death horses lying on the ground shrieked raised their heads and stabbed randomly toward the sky with their hooves  from the distance jonas could hear the thud of cannons overwhelmed by pain he lay there in the fearsome stench for hours listened to the men and animals die and learned what warfare meant  finally when he knew that he could bear it no longer and would welcome death himself he opened his eyes and was once again on the bed  the giver looked away as if he could not bear to see what he had done to jonas forgive me he said      sixteen   jonas did not want to go back he didnt want the memories didnt want the honor didnt want the wisdom didnt want the pain he wanted his childhood again his scraped knees and ball games he sat in his dwelling alone watching through the window seeing children at play citizens bicycling home from uneventful days at work ordinary lives free of anguish because he had been selected as others before him had to bear their burden  but the choice was not his he returned each day to the annex room  the giver was gentle with him for many days following the terrible shared memory of war  there are so many good memories the giver reminded jonas and it was true by now jonas had experienced countless bits of happiness things he had never known of before  he had seen a birthday party with one child singled out and celebrated on his day so that now he understood the joy of being an individual special and unique and proud  he had visited museums and seen paintings filled with all the colors he could now recognize and name  in one ecstatic memory he had ridden a gleaming brown horse across a field that smelled of damp grass and had dismounted beside a small stream from which both he and the horse drank cold clear water now he understood about animals and in the moment that the horse turned from the stream and nudged jonass shoulder affectionately with its head he perceived the bonds between animal and human  he had walked through woods and sat at night beside a campfire although he had through the memories learned about the pain of loss and loneliness now he gained too an understanding of solitude and its joy  what is your favorite jonas asked the giver you dont have to give it away yet he added quickly just tell me about it so i can look forward to it because ill have to receive it when your job is done  the giver smiled lie down he said im happy to give it to you  jonas felt the joy of it as soon as the memory began sometimes it took a while for him to get his bearings to find his place but this time he fit right in and felt the happiness that pervaded the memory  he was in a room filled with people and it was warm with firelight glowing on a hearth he could see through a window that outside it was night and snowing there were colored lights red and green and yellow twinkling from a tree which was oddly inside the room on a table lighted candles stood in a polished golden holder and cast a soft flickering glow he could smell things cooking and he heard soft laughter a goldenhaired dog lay sleeping on the floor  on the floor there were packages wrapped in brightly colored paper and tied with gleaming ribbons as jonas watched a small child began to pick up the packages and pass them around the room to other children to adults who were obviously parents and to an older quiet couple man and woman who sat smiling together on a couch  while jonas watched the people began one by one to untie the ribbons on the packages to unwrap the bright papers open the boxes and reveal toys and clothing and books there were cries of delight they hugged one another  the small child went and sat on the lap of the old woman and she rocked him and rubbed her cheek against his  jonas opened his eyes and lay contentedly on the bed still luxuriating in the warm and comforting memory it had all been there all the things he had learned to treasure  what did you perceive the giver asked  warmth jonas replied and happiness andlet me think family that it was a celebration of some sort a holiday and something elsei cant quite get the word for it  it will come to you  who were the old people why were they there it had puzzled jonas seeing them in the room the old of the community did not ever leave their special place the house of the old where they were so well cared for and respected  they were called grandparents  grand parents  grandparents it meant parentsoftheparents long ago  back and back and back jonas began to laugh so actually there could be parentsoftheparentsoftheparentsofthe parents  the giver laughed too thats right its a little like looking at yourself looking in a mirror looking at yourself looking in a mirror  jonas frowned but my parents must have had parents i never thought about it before who are my parentsoftheparents where are they  you could go look in the hall of open records youd find the names but think son if you apply for children then who will be their parentsoftheparents who will be their grandparents  my mother and father of course  and where will they be  jonas thought oh he said slowly when i finish my training and become a full adult ill be given my own dwelling and then when lily does a few years later shell get her own dwelling and maybe a spouse and children if she applies for them and then mother and father   thats right  as long as theyre still working and contributing to the community theyll go and live with the other childless adults and they wont be part of my life anymore  and after that when the time comes theyll go to the house of the old jonas went on he was thinking aloud and theyll be well cared for and respected and when theyre released there will be a celebration  which you wont attend the giver pointed out  no of course not because i wont even know about it by then ill be so busy with my own life and lily will too so our children if we have them wont know who their parentsofparents are either  it seems to work pretty well that way doesnt it the way we do it in our community jonas asked i just didnt realize there was any other way until i received that memory  it works the giver agreed  jonas hesitated i certainly liked the memory though i can see why its your favorite i couldnt quite get the word for the whole feeling of it the feeling that was so strong in the room  love the giver told him  jonas repeated it love it was a word and concept new to him  they were both silent for a minute then jonas said giver  yes  i feel very foolish saying this very very foolish  no need nothing is foolish here trust the memories and how they make you feel  well jonas said looking at the floor i know you dont have the memory anymore because you gave it to me so maybe you wont understand this   i will i am left with a vague wisp of that one and i have many other memories of families and holidays and happiness of love  jonas blurted out what he was feeling i was thinking that    well i can see that it wasnt a very practical way to live with the old right there in the same place where maybe they wouldnt be well taken care of the way they are now and that we have a betterarranged way of doing things but anyway i was thinking i mean feeling actually that it was kind of nice then and that i wish we could be that way and that you could be my grandparent the family in the memory seemed a little more  he faltered not able to find the word he wanted  a little more complete the giver suggested  jonas nodded i liked the feeling of love he confessed he glanced nervously at the speaker on the wall reassuring himself that no one was listening i wish we still had that he whispered of course he added quickly i do understand that it wouldnt work very well and that its much better to be organized the way we are now i can see that it was a dangerous way to live  what do you mean  jonas hesitated he wasnt certain really what he had meant he could feel that there was risk involved though he wasnt sure how well he said finally grasping for an explanation they had fire right there in that room there was a fire burning in the fireplace and there were candles on a table i can certainly see why those things were outlawed  still he said slowly almost to himself i did like the light they made and the warmth      father mother jonas asked tentatively after the evening meal i have a question i want to ask you  what is it jonas his father asked  he made himself say the words though he felt flushed with embarrassment he had rehearsed them in his mind all the way home from the annex  do you love me  there was an awkward silence for a moment then father gave a little chuckle jonas you of all people precision of language please  what do you mean jonas asked amusement was not at all what he had anticipated  your father means that you used a very generalized word so meaningless that its become almost obsolete his mother explained carefully  jonas stared at them meaningless he had never before felt anything as meaningful as the memory  and of course our community cant function smoothly if people dont use precise language you could ask do you enjoy me the answer is yes his mother said  or his father suggested do you take pride in my accomplishments and the answer is wholeheartedly yes  do you understand why its inappropriate to use a word like love mother asked  jonas nodded yes thank you i do he replied slowly  it was his first lie to his parents      gabriel jonas whispered that night to the newchild the crib was in his room again after gabe had slept soundly in jonass room for four nights his parents had pronounced the experiment a success and jonas a hero gabriel was growing rapidly now crawling and giggling across the room and pulling himself up to stand he could be upgraded in the nurturing center father said happily now that he slept he could be officially named and given to his family in december which was only two months away  but when he was taken away he stopped sleeping again and cried in the night  so he was back in jonass sleepingroom they would give it a little more time they decided since gabe seemed to like it in jonass room he would sleep there at night a little longer until the habit of sound sleep was fully formed the nurturers were very optimistic about gabriels future  there was no answer to jonass whisper gabriel was sound asleep  things could change gabe jonas went on things could be different i dont know how but there must be some way for things to be different there could be colors  and grandparents he added staring through the dimness toward the ceiling of his sleepingroom and everybody would have the memories  you know about memories he whispered turning toward the crib  gabriels breathing was even and deep jonas liked having him there though he felt guilty about the secret each night he gave memories to gabriel memories of boat rides and picnics in the sun memories of soft rainfall against windowpanes memories of dancing barefoot on a damp lawn  gabe  the newchild stirred slightly in his sleep jonas looked over at him  there could be love jonas whispered      the next morning for the first time jonas did not take his pill something within him something that had grown there through the memories told him to throw the pill away      seventeen   today is declared an unscheduled holiday jonas his parents and lily all turned in surprise and looked at the wall speaker from which the announcement had come it happened so rarely and was such a treat for the entire community when it did adults were exempted from the days work children from school and training and volunteer hours the substitute laborers who would be given a different holiday took over all the necessary tasks nurturing food delivery and care of the old and the community was free  jonas cheered and put his homework folder down he had been about to leave for school school was less important to him now and before much more time passed his formal schooling would end but still for twelves though they had begun their adult training there were the endless lists of rules to be memorized and the newest technology to be mastered  he wished his parents sister and gabe a happy day and rode down the bicycle path looking for asher  he had not taken the pills now for four weeks the stirrings had returned and he felt a little guilty and embarrassed about the pleasurable dreams that came to him as he slept but he knew he couldnt go back to the world of no feelings that he had lived in so long  and his new heightened feelings permeated a greater realm than simply his sleep though he knew that his failure to take the pills accounted for some of it he thought that the feelings came also from the memories now he could see all of the colors and he could keep them too so that the trees and grass and bushes stayed green in his vision gabriels rosy cheeks stayed pink even when he slept and apples were always always red  now through the memories he had seen oceans and mountain lakes and streams that gurgled through woods and now he saw the familiar wide river beside the path differently he saw all of the light and color and history it contained and carried in its slowmoving water and he knew that there was an elsewhere from which it came and an elsewhere to which it was going  on this unexpected casual holiday he felt happy as he always had on holidays but with a deeper happiness than ever before thinking as he always did about precision of language jonas realized that it was a new depth of feelings that he was experiencing somehow they were not at all the same as the feelings that every evening in every dwelling every citizen analyzed with endless talk  i felt angry because someone broke the play area rules lily had said once making a fist with her small hand to indicate her fury her familyjonas among themhad talked about the possible reasons for rulebreaking and the need for understanding and patience until lilys fist had relaxed and her anger was gone  but lily had not felt anger jonas realized now shallow impatience and exasperation that was all lily had felt he knew that with certainty because now he knew what anger was now he had in the memories experienced injustice and cruelty and he had reacted with rage that welled up so passionately inside him that the thought of discussing it calmly at the evening meal was unthinkable  i felt sad today he had heard his mother say and they had comforted her  but now jonas had experienced real sadness he had felt grief he knew that there was no quick comfort for emotions like those  these were deeper and they did not need to be told they were felt  today he felt happiness  asher he spied his friends bicycle leaning against a tree at the edge of the playing field nearby other bikes were strewn about on the ground on a holiday the usual rules of order could be disregarded  he skidded to a stop and dropped his own bike beside the others hey ash he shouted looking around there seemed to be no one in the play area where are you  psssheeewwww a childs voice coming from behind a nearby bush made the sound pow pow pow  a female eleven named tanya staggered forward from where she had been hiding dramatically she clutched her stomach and stumbled about in a zigzag pattern groaning you got me she called and fell to the ground grinning  blam  jonas standing on the side of the playing field recognized ashers voice he saw his friend aiming an imaginary weapon in his hand dart from behind one tree to another blam youre in my line of ambush jonas watch out  jonas stepped back he moved behind ashers bike and knelt so that he was out of sight it was a game he had often played with the other children a game of good guys and bad guys a harmless pasttime that used up their contained energy and ended only when they all lay posed in freakish postures on the ground  he had never recognized it before as a game of war  attack the shout came from behind the small storehouse where play equipment was kept three children dashed forward their imaginary weapons in firing position  from the opposite side of the field came an opposing shout counterattack from their hiding places a horde of childrenjonas recognized fiona in the group emerged running in a crouched position firing across the field several of them stopped grabbed their own shoulders and chests with exaggerated gestures and pretended to be hit they dropped to the ground and lay suppressing giggles  feelings surged within jonas he found himself walking forward into the field  youre hit jonas asher yelled from behind the tree pow youre hit again  jonas stood alone in the center of the field several of the children raised their heads and looked at him uneasily the attacking armies slowed emerged from their crouched positions and watched to see what he was doing  in his mind jonas saw again the face of the boy who had lain dying on a field and had begged him for water he had a sudden choking feeling as if it were difficult to breathe  one of the children raised an imaginary rifle and made an attempt to destroy him with a firing noise pssheeew then they were all silent standing awkwardly and the only sound was the sound of jonass shuddering breaths he was struggling not to cry  gradually when nothing happened nothing changed the children looked at each other nervously and went away he heard the sounds as they righted their bicycles and began to ride down the path that led from the field  only asher and fiona remained  whats wrong jonas it was only a game fiona said  you ruined it asher said in an irritated voice  dont play it anymore jonas pleaded  im the one whos training for assistant recreation director asher pointed out angrily games arent your area of expertness  expertise jonas corrected him automatically  whatever you cant say what we play even if you are going to be the new receiver asher looked warily at him i apologize for not paying you the respect you deserve he mumbled  asher jonas said he was trying to speak carefully and with kindness to say exactly what he wanted to say you had no way of knowing this i didnt know it myself until recently but its a cruel game in the past there have   i said i apologize jonas  jonas sighed it was no use of course asher couldnt understand i accept your apology asher he said wearily  do you want to go for a ride along the river jonas fiona asked biting her lip with nervousness  jonas looked at her she was so lovely for a fleeting instant he thought he would like nothing better than to ride peacefully along the river path laughing and talking with his gentle female friend but he knew that such times had been taken from him now he shook his head after a moment his two friends turned and went to their bikes he watched as they rode away  jonas trudged to the bench beside the storehouse and sat down overwhelmed with feelings of loss his childhood his friendships his carefree sense of securityall of these things seemed to be slipping away with his new heightened feelings he was overwhelmed by sadness at the way the others had laughed and shouted playing at war but he knew that they could not understand why without the memories he felt such love for asher and for fiona but they could not feel it back without the memories and he could not give them those jonas knew with certainty that he could change nothing      back in their dwelling that evening lily chattered merrily about the wonderful holiday she had had playing with her friends having her midday meal out of doors and she confessed sneaking a very short try on her fathers bicycle  i cant wait till i get my very own bicycle next month fathers is too big for me i fell she explained matteroffactly good thing gabe wasnt in the child seat  a very good thing mother agreed frowning at the idea of it gabriel waved his arms at the mention of himself he had begun to walk just the week before the first steps of a newchild were always the occasion for celebration at the nurturing center father said but also for the introduction of a discipline wand now father brought the slender instrument home with him each night in case gabriel misbehaved  but he was a happy and easygoing toddler now he moved unsteadily across the room laughing gay he chirped gay it was the way he said his own name  jonas brightened it had been a depressing day for him after such a bright start but he set his glum thoughts aside he thought about starting to teach lily to ride so that she could speed off proudly after her ceremony of nine which would be coming soon it was hard to believe that it was almost december again that almost a year had passed since he had become a twelve  he smiled as he watched the newchild plant one small foot carefully before the other grinning with glee at his own steps as he tried them out  i want to get to sleep early tonight father said tomorrows a busy day for me the twins are being born tomorrow and the test results show that theyre identical  one for here one for elsewhere lily chanted one for here one for else   do you actually take it elsewhere father jonas asked  no i just have to make the selection i weigh them hand the larger over to a nurturer whos standing by waiting and then i get the smaller one all cleaned up and comfy then i perform a small ceremony of release and  he glanced down grinning at gabriel then i wave byebye he said in the special sweet voice he used when he spoke to the newchild he waved his hand in the familiar gesture  gabriel giggled and waved byebye back to him  and somebody else comes to get him somebody from elsewhere  thats right jonasbonus  jonas rolled his eyes in embarrassment that his father had used the silly pet name  lily was deep in thought what if they give the little twin a name elsewhere a name like oh maybe jonathan and here in our community at his naming the twin that we kept here is given the name jonathan and then there would be two children with the same name and they would look exactly the same and someday maybe when they were a six one group of sixes would go to visit another community on a bus and there in the other community in the other group of sixes would be a jonathan who was exactly the same as the other jonathan and then maybe they would get mixed up and take the wrong jonathan home and maybe his parents wouldnt notice and then   she paused for breath  lily mother said i have a wonderful idea maybe when you become a twelve theyll give you the assignment of storyteller i dont think weve had a storyteller in the community for a long time but if i were on the committee i would definitely choose you for that job  lily grinned i have a better idea for one more story she announced what if actually we were all twins and didnt know it and so elsewhere there would be another lily and another jonas and another father and another asher and another chief elder and another   father groaned lily he said its bedtime      eighteen   giver jonas asked the next afternoon do you ever think about release  do you mean my own release or just the general topic of release  both i guess i apologii mean i should have been more precise but i dont know exactly what i meant  sit back up no need to lie down while were talking jonas who had already been stretched out on the bed when the question came to his mind sat back up  i guess i do think about it occasionally the giver said i think about my own release when im in an awful lot of pain i wish i could put in a request for it sometimes but im not permitted to do that until the new receiver is trained  me jonas said in a dejected voice he was not looking forward to the end of the training when he would become the new receiver it was clear to him what a terribly difficult and lonely life it was despite the honor  i cant request release either jonas pointed out it was in my rules  the giver laughed harshly i know that they hammered out those rules after the failure ten years ago  jonas had heard again and again now reference to the previous failure but he still did not know what had happened ten years before giver he said tell me what happened please  the giver shrugged on the surface it was quite simple a receivertobe was selected the way you were the selection went smoothly enough the ceremony was held and the selection was made the crowd cheered as they did for you the new receiver was puzzled and a little frightened as you were  my parents told me it was a female  the giver nodded  jonas thought of his favorite female fiona and shivered he wouldnt want his gentle friend to suffer the way he had taking on the memories what was she like he asked the giver  the giver looked sad thinking about it she was a remarkable young woman very selfpossessed and serene intelligent eager to learn he shook his head and drew a deep breath you know jonas when she came to me in this room when she presented herself to begin her training   jonas interrupted him with a question can you tell me her name my parents said that it wasnt to be spoken again in the community but couldnt you say it just to me  the giver hesitated painfully as if saying the name aloud might be excruciating her name was rosemary he told jonas finally  rosemary i like that name  the giver went on when she came to me for the first time she sat there in the chair where you sat on your first day she was eager and excited and a little scared we talked i tried to explain things as well as i could  the way you did to me  the giver chuckled ruefully the explanations are difficult the whole thing is so beyond ones experience but i tried and she listened carefully her eyes were very luminous i remember  he looked up suddenly jonas i gave you a memory that i told you was my favorite i still have a shred of it left the room with the family and grandparents  jonas nodded of course he remembered yes he said it had that wonderful feeling with it you told me it was love  you can understand then that thats what i felt for rosemary the giver explained i loved her  i feel it for you too he added  what happened to her jonas asked  her training began she received well as you do she was so enthusiastic so delighted to experience new things i remember her laughter     his voice faltered and trailed off  what happened jonas asked again after a moment please tell me  the giver closed his eyes it broke my heart jonas to transfer pain to her but it was my job it was what i had to do the way ive had to do it to you  the room was silent jonas waited finally the giver continued  five weeks that was all i gave her happy memories a ride on a merrygoround a kitten to play with a picnic sometimes i chose one just because i knew it would make her laugh and i so treasured the sound of that laughter in this room that had always been so silent  but she was like you jonas she wanted to experience everything she knew that it was her responsibility and so she asked me for more difficult memories  jonas held his breath for a moment you didnt give her war did you not after just five weeks  the giver shook his head and sighed no and i didnt give her physical pain but i gave her loneliness and i gave her loss i transferred a memory of a child taken from its parents that was the first one she appeared stunned at its end  jonas swallowed rosemary and her laughter had begun to seem real to him and he pictured her looking up from the bed of memories shocked  the giver continued i backed off gave her more little delights but everything changed once she knew about pain i could see it in her eyes  she wasnt brave enough jonas suggested  the giver didnt respond to the question she insisted that i continue that i not spare her she said it was her duty and i knew of course that she was correct  i couldnt bring myself to inflict physical pain on her but i gave her anguish of many kinds poverty and hunger and terror  i had to jonas it was my job and she had been chosen the giver looked at him imploringly jonas stroked his hand  finally one afternoon we finished for the day it had been a hard session i tried to finishas i do with youby transferring something happy and cheerful but the times of laughter were gone by then she stood up very silently frowning as if she were making a decision then she came over to me and put her arms around me she kissed my cheek as jonas watched the giver stroked his own cheek recalling the touch of rosemarys lips ten years before  she left here that day left this room and did not go back to her dwelling i was notified by the speaker that she had gone directly to the chief elder and asked to be released  but its against the rules the receiverintraining cant apply for rel   its in your rules jonas but it wasnt in hers she asked for release and they had to give it to her i never saw her again  so that was the failure jonas thought it was obvious that it saddened the giver very deeply but it didnt seem such a terrible thing after all and he jonas would never have done itnever have requested release no matter how difficult his training became the giver needed a successor and he had been chosen  a thought occurred to jonas rosemary had been released very early in her training what if something happened to him jonas he had a whole years worth of memories now  giver he asked i cant request release i know that but what if something happened an accident what if i fell into the river like the little four caleb did well that doesnt make sense because im a good swimmer but what if i couldnt swim and fell into the river and was lost then there wouldnt be a new receiver but you would already have given away an awful lot of important memories so even though they would select a new receiver the memories would be gone except for the shreds that you have left of them and then what if   he started to laugh suddenly i sound like my sister lily he said amused at himself  the giver looked at him gravely you just stay away from the river my friend he said the community lost rosemary after five weeks and it was a disaster for them i dont know what the community would do if they lost you  why was it a disaster  i think i mentioned to you once the giver reminded him that when she was gone the memories came back to the people if you were to be lost in the river jonas your memories would not be lost with you memories are forever  rosemary had only those five weeks worth and most of them were good ones but there were those few terrible memories the ones that had overwhelmed her for a while they overwhelmed the community all those feelings  theyd never experienced that before  i was so devastated by my own grief at her loss and my own feeling of failure that i didnt even try to help them through it i was angry too  the giver was quiet for a moment obviously thinking you know he said finally if they lost you with all the training youve had now theyd have all those memories again themselves  jonas made a face theyd hate that  they certainly would they wouldnt know how to deal with it at all  the only way i deal with it is by having you there to help me jonas pointed out with a sigh  the giver nodded i suppose he said slowly that i could   you could what  the giver was still deep in thought after a moment he said if you floated off in the river i suppose i could help the whole community the way ive helped you its an interesting concept i need to think about it some more maybe well talk about it again sometime but not now  im glad youre a good swimmer jonas but stay away from the river he laughed a little but the laughter was not lighthearted his thoughts seemed to be elsewhere and his eyes were very troubled      nineteen   jonas glanced at the clock there was so much work to be done always that he and the giver seldom simply sat and talked the way they just had  im sorry that i wasted so much time with my questions jonas said i was only asking about release because my father is releasing a newchild today a twin he has to select one and release the other one they do it by weight jonas glanced at the clock actually i suppose hes already finished i think it was this morning  the givers face took on a solemn look i wish they wouldnt do that he said quietly almost to himself  well they cant have two identical people around think how confusing it would be jonas chuckled  i wish i could watch he added as an afterthought he liked the thought of seeing his father perform the ceremony and making the little twin clean and comfy his father was such a gentle man  you can watch the giver said  no jonas told him they never let children watch its very private  jonas the giver told him i know that you read your training instructions very carefully dont you remember that you are allowed to ask anyone anything  jonas nodded yes but   jonas when you and i have finished our time together you will be the new receiver you can read the books youll have the memories you have access to everything its part of your training if you want to watch a release you have simply to ask  jonas shrugged well maybe i will then but its too late for this one im sure it was this morning  the giver told him then something he had not known all private ceremonies are recorded theyre in the hall of closed records do you want to see this mornings release  jonas hesitated he was afraid that his father wouldnt like it if he watched something so private  i think you should the giver told him firmly  all right then jonas said tell me how  the giver rose from his chair went to the speaker on the wall and clicked the switch from off to on  the voice spoke immediately yes receiver how may i help you  i would like to see this mornings release of the twin  one moment receiver thank you for your instructions  jonas watched the video screen above the row of switches its blank face began to flicker with zigzag lines then some numbers appeared followed by the date and time he was astonished and delighted that this was available to him and surprised that he had not known  suddenly he could see a small windowless room empty except for a bed a table with some equipment on itjonas recognized a scale he had seen them before when hed been doing volunteer hours at the nurturing centerand a cupboard he could see pale carpeting on the floor  its just an ordinary room he commented i thought maybe theyd have it in the auditorium so that everybody could come all the old go to ceremonies of release but i suppose that when its just a newborn they dont   shhh the giver said his eyes on the screen  jonass father wearing his nurturing uniform entered the room cradling a tiny newchild wrapped in a soft blanket in his arms a uniformed woman followed through the door carrying a second newchild wrapped in a similar blanket  thats my father jonas found himself whispering as if he might wake the little ones if he spoke aloud and the other nurturer is his assistant shes still in training but shell be finished soon  the two nurturers unwrapped the blankets and laid the identical newborns on the bed they were naked jonas could see that they were males  he watched fascinated as his father gently lifted one and then the other to the scale and weighed them  he heard his father laugh good his father said to the woman i thought for a moment that they might both be exactly the same then wed have a problem but this one he handed one after rewrapping it to his assistant is six pounds even so you can clean him up and dress him and take him over to the center  the woman took the newchild and left through the door she had entered  jonas watched as his father bent over the squirming newchild on the bed and you little guy youre only five pounds ten ounces a shrimp  thats the special voice he uses with gabriel jonas remarked smiling  watch the giver said  now he cleans him up and makes him comfy jonas told him he told me  be quiet jonas the giver commanded in a strange voice watch  obediently jonas concentrated on the screen waiting for what would happen next he was especially curious about the ceremony part  his father turned and opened the cupboard he took out a syringe and a small bottle very carefully he inserted the needle into the bottle and began to fill the syringe with a clear liquid  jonas winced sympathetically he had forgotten that newchildren had to get shots he hated shots himself though he knew that they were necessary  to his surprise his father began very carefully to direct the needle into the top of newchilds forehead puncturing the place where the fragile skin pulsed the newborn squirmed and wailed faintly  whys he   shhh the giver said sharply  his father was talking and jonas realized that he was hearing the answer to the question he had started to ask still in the special voice his father was saying i know i know it hurts little guy but i have to use a vein and the veins in your arms are still too teenyweeny  he pushed the plunger very slowly injecting the liquid into the scalp vein until the syringe was empty  all done that wasnt so bad was it jonas heard his father say cheerfully he turned aside and dropped the syringe into a waste receptacle  now he cleans him up and makes him comfy jonas said to himself aware that the giver didnt want to talk during the little ceremony  as he continued to watch the newchild no longer crying moved his arms and legs in a jerking motion then he went limp his head fell to the side his eyes half open then he was still  with an odd shocked feeling jonas recognized the gestures and posture and expression they were familiar he had seen them before but he couldnt remember where  jonas stared at the screen waiting for something to happen but nothing did the little twin lay motionless his father was putting things away folding the blanket closing the cupboard  once again as he had on the playing field he felt the choking sensation once again he saw the face of the lighthaired bloodied soldier as life left his eyes the memory came back  he killed it my father killed it jonas said to himself stunned at what he was realizing he continued to stare at the screen numbly  his father tidied the room then he picked up a small carton that lay waiting on the floor set it on the bed and lifted the limp body into it he placed the lid on tightly  he picked up the carton and carried it to the other side of the room he opened a small door in the wall jonas could see darkness behind the door it seemed to be the same sort of chute into which trash was deposited at school  his father loaded the carton containing the body into the chute and gave it a shove  byebye little guy jonas heard his father say before he left the room then the screen went blank  the giver turned to him quite calmly he related when the speaker notified me that rosemary had applied for release they turned on the tape to show me the process there she wasmy last glimpse of that beautiful childwaiting they brought in the syringe and asked her to roll up her sleeve  you suggested jonas that perhaps she wasnt brave enough i dont know about bravery what it is what it means i do know that i sat here numb with horror wretched with helplessness and i listened as rosemary told them that she would prefer to inject herself  then she did so i didnt watch i looked away  the giver turned to him well there you are jonas you were wondering about release he said in a bitter voice  jonas felt a ripping sensation inside himself the feeling of terrible pain clawing its way forward to emerge in a cry      twenty   i wont i wont go home you cant make me jonas sobbed and shouted and pounded the bed with his fists  sit up jonas the giver told him firmly  jonas obeyed him weeping shuddering he sat on the edge of the bed he would not look at the giver  you may stay here tonight i want to talk to you but you must be quiet now while i notify your family unit no one must hear you cry  jonas looked up wildly no one heard that little twin cry either no one but my father he collapsed in sobs again  the giver waited silently finally jonas was able to quiet himself and he sat huddled his shoulders shaking  the giver went to the wall speaker and clicked the switch to on  yes receiver how may i help you  notify the new receivers family unit that he will be staying with me tonight for additional training  i will take care of that sir thank you for your instructions the voice said  i will take care of that sir i will take care of that sir jonas mimicked in a cruel sarcastic voice i will do whatever you like sir i will kill people sir old people small newborn people id be happy to kill them sir thank you for your instructions sir how may i help y  he couldnt seem to stop  the giver grasped his shoulders firmly jonas fell silent and stared at him  listen to me jonas they cant help it they know nothing  you said that to me once before  i said it because its true its the way they live its the life that was created for them its the same life that you would have if you had not been chosen as my successor  but he lied to me jonas wept  its what he was told to do and he knows nothing else  what about you do you lie to me too jonas almost spat the question at the giver  i am empowered to lie but i have never lied to you  jonas stared at him release is always like that for people who break the rules three times for the old do they kill the old too  yes its true  and what about fiona she loves the old shes in training to care for them does she know yet what will she do when she finds out how will she feel jonas brushed wetness from his face with the back of one hand  fiona is already being trained in the fine art of release the giver told him shes very efficient at her work your redhaired friend feelings are not part of the life shes learned  jonas wrapped his arms around himself and rocked his own body back and forth what should i do i cant go back i cant  the giver stood up first i will order our evening meal then we will eat  jonas found himself using the nasty sarcastic voice again then well have a sharing of feelings  the giver gave a rueful anguished empty laugh jonas you and i are the only ones who have feelings weve been sharing them now for almost a year  im sorry giver jonas said miserably i dont mean to be so hateful not to you  the giver rubbed jonass hunched shoulders and after we eat he went on well make a plan  jonas looked up puzzled a plan for what theres nothing theres nothing we can do its always been this way before me before you before the ones who came before you back and back and back his voice trailed the familiar phrase  jonas the giver said after a moment its true that it has been this way for what seems forever but the memories tell us that it has not always been people felt things once you and i have been part of that so we know we know that they once felt things like pride and sorrow and   and love jonas added remembering the family scene that had so affected him and pain he thought again of the soldier  the worst part of holding the memories is not the pain its the loneliness of it memories need to be shared  ive started to share them with you jonas said trying to cheer him  thats true and having you here with me over the past year has made me realize that things must change for years ive felt that they should but it seemed so hopeless  now for the first time i think there might be a way the giver said slowly and you brought it to my attention barely  he glanced at the clock two hours ago  jonas watched him and listened      it was late at night now they had talked and talked jonas sat wrapped in a robe belonging to the giver the long robe that only elders wore  it was possible what they had planned barely possible if it failed he would very likely be killed  but what did that matter if he stayed his life was no longer worth living  yes he told the giver ill do it i think i can do it ill try anyway but i want you to come with me  the giver shook his head jonas he said the community has depended all these generations back and back and back on a resident receiver to hold their memories for them ive turned over many of them to you in the past year and i cant take them back theres no way for me to get them back if i have given them  so if you escape once you are goneand jonas you know that you can never return   jonas nodded solemnly it was the terrifying part yes he said i know but if you come with me   the giver shook his head and made a gesture to silence him he continued if you get away if you get beyond if you get to elsewhere it will mean that the community has to bear the burden themselves of the memories you had been holding for them  i think that they can and that they will acquire some wisdom but it will be desperately hard for them when we lost rosemary ten years ago and her memories returned to the people they panicked and those were such few memories compared to yours when your memories return theyll need help remember how i helped you in the beginning when the receiving of memories was new to you  jonas nodded it was scary at first and it hurt a lot  you needed me then and now they will  its no use theyll find someone to take my place theyll choose a new receiver  theres no one ready for training not right away oh theyll speed up the selection of course but i cant think of another child who has the right qualities   theres a little female with pale eyes but shes only a six  thats correct i know the one you mean her name is katharine but shes too young so they will be forced to bear those memories  i want you to come giver jonas pleaded  no i have to stay here the giver said firmly i want to jonas if i go with you and together we take away all their protection from the memories jonas the community will be left with no one to help them theyll be thrown into chaos theyll destroy themselves i cant go  giver jonas suggested you and i dont need to care about the rest of them  the giver looked at him with a questioning smile jonas hung his head of course they needed to care it was the meaning of everything  and in any case jonas the giver sighed i wouldnt make it im very weakened now do you know that i no longer see colors  jonass heart broke he reached for the givers hand  you have the colors the giver told him and you have the courage i will help you to have the strength  a year ago jonas reminded him when i had just become a twelve when i began to see the first color you told me that the beginning had been different for you but that i wouldnt understand  the giver brightened thats true and do you know jonas that with all your knowledge now with all your memories with all youve learnedstill you wont understand because ive been a little selfish i havent given any of it to you i wanted to keep it for myself to the last  keep what  when i was just a boy younger than you it began to come to me but it wasnt the seeingbeyond for me it was different for me it was hearingbeyond  jonas frowned trying to figure that out what did you hear he asked  music the giver said smiling i began to hear something truly remarkable and it is called music ill give you some before i go  jonas shook his head emphatically no giver he said i want you to keep that to have with you when im gone      jonas went home the next morning cheerfully greeted his parents and lied easily about what a busy pleasant night he had had  his father smiled and lied easily too about his busy and pleasant day the day before  throughout the school day as he did his lessons jonas went over the plan in his head it seemed startlingly simple jonas and the giver had gone over it and over it late into the night hours  for the next two weeks as the time for the december ceremony approached the giver would transfer every memory of courage and strength that he could to jonas he would need those to help him find the elsewhere that they were both sure existed they knew it would be a very difficult journey  then in the middle of the night before the ceremony jonas would secretly leave his dwelling this was probably the most dangerous part because it was a violation of a major rule for any citizen not on official business to leave a dwelling at night  ill leave at midnight jonas said the food collectors will be finished picking up the eveningmeal remains by then and the pathmaintenance crews dont start their work that early so there wont be anyone to see me unless of course someone is out on emergency business  i dont know what you should do if you are seen jonas the giver had said i have memories of course of all kinds of escapes people fleeing from terrible things throughout history but every situation is individual there is no memory of one like this  ill be careful jonas said no one will see me  as receiverintraining youre held in very high respect already so i think you wouldnt be questioned very forcefully  id just say i was on some important errand for the receiver id say it was all your fault that i was out after hours jonas teased  they both laughed a little nervously but jonas was certain that he could slip away unseen from his house carrying an extra set of clothing silently he would take his bicycle to the riverbank and leave it there hidden in bushes with the clothing folded beside it  then he would make his way through the darkness on foot silently to the annex  theres no nighttime attendant the giver explained ill leave the door unlocked you simply slip into the room ill be waiting for you  his parents would discover when they woke that he was gone they would also find a cheerful note from jonas on his bed telling them that he was going for an early morning ride along the river that he would be back for the ceremony  his parents would be irritated but not alarmed they would think him inconsiderate and they would plan to chastise him later  they would wait with mounting anger for him finally they would be forced to go taking lily to the ceremony without him  they wont say anything to anyone though jonas said quite certain they wont call attention to my rudeness because it would reflect on their parenting and anyway everyone is so involved in the ceremony that they probably wont notice that im not there now that im a twelve and in training i dont have to sit with my age group any more so asher will think im with my parents or with you  and your parents will assume youre with asher or with me  jonas shrugged it will take everyone a while to realize that im not there at all  and you and i will be long on our way by then  in the early morning the giver would order a vehicle and driver from the speaker he visited the other communities frequently meeting with their elders his responsibilities extended over all the surrounding areas so this would not be an unusual undertaking  ordinarily the giver did not attend the december ceremony last year he had been present because of the occasion of jonass selection in which he was so involved but his life was usually quite separate from that of the community no one would comment on his absence or on the fact that he had chosen this day to be away  when the driver and vehicle arrived the giver would send the driver on some brief errand during his absence the giver would help jonas hide in the storage area of the vehicle he would have with him a bundle of food which the giver would save from his own meals during the next two weeks  the ceremony would begin with all the community there and by then jonas and the giver would be on their way  by midday jonass absence would become apparent and would be a cause for serious concern the ceremony would not be disruptedsuch a disruption would be unthinkable but searchers would be sent out into the community  by the time his bicycle and clothing were found the giver would be returning jonas by then would be on his own making his journey elsewhere  the giver on his return would find the community in a state of confusion and panic confronted by a situation which they had never faced before and having no memories from which to find either solace or wisdom they would not know what to do and would seek his advice  he would go to the auditorium where the people would be gathered still he would stride to the stage and command their attention  he would make the solemn announcement that jonas had been lost in the river he would immediately begin the ceremony of loss  jonas jonas they would say loudly as they had once said the name of caleb the giver would lead the chant together they would let jonass presence in their lives fade away as they said his name in unison more slowly softer and softer until he was disappearing from them until he was no more than an occasional murmur and then by the end of the long day gone forever not to be mentioned again  their attention would turn to the overwhelming task of bearing the memories themselves the giver would help them      yes i understand that theyll need you jonas had said at the end of the lengthy discussion and planning but ill need you too please come with me he knew the answer even as he made the final plea  my work will be finished the giver had replied gently when i have helped the community to change and become whole  im grateful to you jonas because without you i would never have figured out a way to bring about the change but your role now is to escape and my role is to stay  but dont you want to be with me giver jonas asked sadly  the giver hugged him i love you jonas he said but i have another place to go when my work here is finished i want to be with my daughter  jonas had been staring glumly at the floor now he looked up startled i didnt know you had a daughter giver you told me that youd had a spouse but i never knew about your daughter  the giver smiled and nodded for the first time in their long months together jonas saw him look truly happy  her name was rosemary the giver said      twentyone   it would work they could make it work jonas told himself again and again throughout the day  but that evening everything changed all of itall the things they had thought through so meticulouslyfell apart      that night jonas was forced to flee he left the dwelling shortly after the sky became dark and the community still it was terribly dangerous because some of the work crews were still about but he moved stealthily and silently staying in the shadows making his way past the darkened dwellings and the empty central plaza toward the river beyond the plaza he could see the house of the old with the annex behind it outlined against the night sky but he could not stop there there was no time every minute counted now and every minute must take him farther from the community  now he was on the bridge hunched over on the bicycle pedaling steadily he could see the dark churning water far below  he felt surprisingly no fear nor any regret at leaving the community behind but he felt a very deep sadness that he had left his closest friend behind he knew that in the danger of his escape he must be absolutely silent but with his heart and mind he called back and hoped that with his capacity for hearingbeyond the giver would know that jonas had said goodbye      it had happened at the evening meal the family unit was eating together as always lily chattering away mother and father making their customary comments and lies jonas knew about the day nearby gabriel played happily on the floor babbling his baby talk looking with glee now and then toward jonas obviously delighted to have him back after the unexpected night away from the dwelling  father glanced down toward the toddler enjoy it little guy he said this is your last night as visitor  what do you mean jonas asked him  father sighed with disappointment well you know he wasnt here when you got home this morning because we had him stay overnight at the nurturing center it seemed like a good opportunity with you gone to give it a try hed been sleeping so soundly  didnt it go well mother asked sympathetically  father gave a rueful laugh thats an understatement it was a disaster he cried all night apparently the night crew couldnt handle it they were really frazzled by the time i got to work  gabe you naughty thing lily said with a scolding little cluck toward the grinning toddler on the floor  so father went on we obviously had to make the decision even i voted for gabriels release when we had the meeting this afternoon  jonas put down his fork and stared at his father release he asked  father nodded we certainly gave it our best try didnt we  yes we did mother agreed emphatically  lily nodded in agreement too  jonas worked at keeping his voice absolutely calm when he asked when will he be released  first thing tomorrow morning we have to start our preparations for the naming ceremony so we thought wed get this taken care of right away  its byebye to you gabe in the morning father had said in his sweet singsong voice      jonas reached the opposite side of the river stopped briefly and looked back the community where his entire life had been lived lay behind him now sleeping at dawn the orderly disciplined life he had always known would continue again without him the life where nothing was ever unexpected or inconvenient or unusual the life without color pain or past  he pushed firmly again at the pedal with his foot and continued riding along the road it was not safe to spend time looking back he thought of the rules he had broken so far enough that if he were caught now he would be condemned  first he had left the dwelling at night a major transgression  second he had robbed the community of food a very serious crime even though what he had taken was leftovers set out on the dwelling doorsteps for collection  third he had stolen his fathers bicycle he had hesitated for a moment standing beside the bikeport in the darkness not wanting anything of his fathers and uncertain as well whether he could comfortably ride the larger bike when he was so accustomed to his own  but it was necessary because it had the child seat attached to the back  and he had taken gabriel too      he could feel the little head nudge his back bouncing gently against him as he rode gabriel was sleeping soundly strapped into the seat before he had left the dwelling he had laid his hands firmly on gabes back and transmitted to him the most soothing memory he could a slowswinging hammock under palm trees on an island someplace at evening with a rhythmic sound of languid water lapping hypnotically against a beach nearby as the memory seeped from him into the newchild he could feel gabes sleep ease and deepen there had been no stir at all when jonas lifted him from the crib and placed him gently into the molded seat  he knew that he had the remaining hours of night before they would be aware of his escape so he rode hard steadily willing himself not to tire as the minutes and miles passed there had been no time to receive the memories he and the giver had counted on of strength and courage so he relied on what he had and hoped it would be enough  he circled the outlying communities their dwellings dark gradually the distances between communities widened with longer stretches of empty road his legs ached at first then as time passed they became numb  at dawn gabriel began to stir they were in an isolated place fields on either side of the road were dotted with thickets of trees here and there he saw a stream and made his way to it across a rutted bumpy meadow gabriel wide awake now giggled as the bicycle jolted him up and down  jonas unstrapped gabe lifted him from the bike and watched him investigate the grass and twigs with delight carefully he hid the bicycle in thick bushes  morning meal gabe he unwrapped some of the food and fed them both then he filled the cup he had brought with water from the stream and held it for gabriel to drink he drank thirstily himself and sat by the stream watching the newchild play  he was exhausted he knew he must sleep resting his own muscles and preparing himself for more hours on the bicycle it would not be safe to travel in daylight  they would be looking for him soon  he found a place deeply hidden in the trees took the newchild there and lay down holding gabriel in his arms gabe struggled cheerfully as if it were a wrestling game the kind they had played back in the dwelling with tickles and laughter  sorry gabe jonas told him i know its morning and i know you just woke up but we have to sleep now  he cuddled the small body close to him and rubbed the little back he murmured to gabriel soothingly then he pressed his hands firmly and transmitted a memory of deep contented exhaustion gabriels head nodded after a moment and fell against jonass chest  together the fugitives slept through the first dangerous day      the most terrifying thing was the planes by now days had passed jonas no longer knew how many the journey had become automatic the sleep by days hidden in underbrush and trees the finding of water the careful division of scraps of food augmented by what he could find in the fields and the endless endless miles on the bicycle by night  his leg muscles were taut now they ached when he settled himself to sleep but they were stronger and he stopped now less often to rest sometimes he paused and lifted gabriel down for a brief bit of exercise running down the road or through a field together in the dark but always when he returned strapped the uncomplaining toddler into the seat again and remounted his legs were ready  so he had enough strength of his own and had not needed what the giver might have provided had there been time  but when the planes came he wished that he could have received the courage  he knew they were search planes they flew so low that they woke him with the noise of their engines and sometimes looking out and up fearfully from the hiding places he could almost see the faces of the searchers  he knew that they could not see color and that their flesh as well as gabriels light golden curls would be no more than smears of gray against the colorless foliage but he remembered from his science and technology studies at school that the search planes used heatseeking devices which could identify body warmth and would hone in on two humans huddled in shrubbery  so always when he heard the aircraft sound he reached to gabriel and transmitted memories of snow keeping some for himself together they became cold and when the planes were gone they would shiver holding each other until sleep came again  sometimes urging the memories into gabriel jonas felt that they were more shallow a little weaker than they had been it was what he had hoped and what he and the giver had planned that as he moved away from the community he would shed the memories and leave them behind for the people but now when he needed them when the planes came he tried hard to cling to what he still had of cold and to use it for their survival  usually the aircraft came by day when they were hiding but he was alert at night too on the road always listening intently for the sound of the engines even gabriel listened and would call out plane plane sometimes before jonas had heard the terrifying noise when the aircraft searchers came as they did occasionally during the night as they rode jonas sped to the nearest tree or bush dropped to the ground and made himself and gabriel cold but it was sometimes a frighteningly close call  as he pedaled through the nights through isolated landscape now with the communities far behind and no sign of human habitation around him or ahead he was constantly vigilant looking for the next nearest hiding place should the sound of engines come  but the frequency of the planes diminished they came less often and flew when they did come less slowly as if the search had become haphazard and no longer hopeful finally there was an entire day and night when they did not come at all      twentytwo   now the landscape was changing it was a subtle change hard to identify at first the road was narrower and bumpy apparently no longer tended by road crews it was harder suddenly to balance on the bike as the front wheel wobbled over stones and ruts  one night jonas fell when the bike jolted to a sudden stop against a rock he grabbed instinctively for gabriel and the newchild strapped tightly in his seat was uninjured only frightened when the bike fell to its side but jonass ankle was twisted and his knees were scraped and raw blood seeping through his torn trousers painfully he righted himself and the bike and reassured gabe  tentatively he began to ride in daylight he had forgotten the fear of the searchers who seemed to have diminished into the past but now there were new fears the unfamiliar landscape held hidden unknown perils  trees became more numerous and the forests beside the road were dark and thick with mystery they saw streams more frequently now and stopped often to drink jonas carefully washed his injured knees wincing as he rubbed at the raw flesh the constant ache of his swollen ankle was eased when he soaked it occasionally in the cold water that rushed through roadside gullies  he was newly aware that gabriels safety depended entirely upon his own continued strength  they saw their first waterfall and for the first time wildlife  plane plane gabriel called and jonas turned swiftly into the trees though he had not seen planes in days and he did not hear an aircraft engine now when he stopped the bicycle in the shrubbery and turned to grab gabe he saw the small chubby arm pointing toward the sky  terrified he looked up but it was not a plane at all though he had never seen one before he identified it from his fading memories for the giver had given them to him often it was a bird  soon there were many birds along the way soaring overhead calling they saw deer and once beside the road looking at them curious and unafraid a small reddishbrown creature with a thick tail whose name jonas did not know he slowed the bike and they stared at one another until the creature turned away and disappeared into the woods  all of it was new to him after a life of sameness and predictability he was awed by the surprises that lay beyond each curve of the road he slowed the bike again and again to look with wonder at wildflowers to enjoy the throaty warble of a new bird nearby or merely to watch the way wind shifted the leaves in the trees during his twelve years in the community he had never felt such simple moments of exquisite happiness  but there were desperate fears building in him now as well the most relentless of his new fears was that they would starve now that they had left the cultivated fields behind them it was almost impossible to find food they finished the meager store of potatoes and carrots they had saved from the last agricultural area and now they were always hungry  jonas knelt by a stream and tried without success to catch a fish with his hands frustrated he threw rocks into the water knowing even as he did so that it was useless finally in desperation he fashioned a makeshift net looping the strands of gabriels blanket around a curved stick  after countless tries the net yielded two flopping silvery fish methodically jonas hacked them to pieces with a sharp rock and fed the raw shreds to himself and to gabriel they ate some berries and tried without success to catch a bird  at night while gabriel slept beside him jonas lay awake tortured by hunger and remembered his life in the community where meals were delivered to each dwelling every day  he tried to use the flagging power of his memory to recreate meals and managed brief tantalizing fragments banquets with huge roasted meats birthday parties with thickfrosted cakes and lush fruits picked and eaten sunwarmed and dripping from trees  but when the memory glimpses subsided he was left with the gnawing painful emptiness jonas remembered suddenly and grimly the time in his childhood when he had been chastised for misusing a word the word had been starving you have never been starving he had been told you will never be starving  now he was if he had stayed in the community he would not be it was as simple as that once he had yearned for choice then when he had had a choice he had made the wrong one the choice to leave and now he was starving  but if he had stayed     his thoughts continued if he had stayed he would have starved in other ways he would have lived a life hungry for feelings for color for love  and gabriel for gabriel there would have been no life at all so there had not really been a choice  it became a struggle to ride the bicycle as jonas weakened from lack of food and realized at the same time that he was encountering something he had for a long time yearned to see hills his sprained ankle throbbed as he forced the pedal downward in an effort that was almost beyond him  and the weather was changing it rained for two days jonas had never seen rain though he had experienced it often in the memories he had liked those rains enjoyed the new feeling of it but this was different he and gabriel became cold and wet and it was hard to get dry even when sunshine occasionally followed  gabriel had not cried during the long frightening journey now he did he cried because he was hungry and cold and terribly weak jonas cried too for the same reasons and another reason as well he wept because he was afraid now that he could not save gabriel he no longer cared about himself      twentythree   jonas felt more and more certain that the destination lay ahead of him very near now in the night that was approaching none of his senses confirmed it he saw nothing ahead except the endless ribbon of road unfolding in twisting narrow curves he heard no sound ahead  yet he felt it felt that elsewhere was not far away but he had little hope left that he would be able to reach it his hope diminished further when the sharp cold air began to blur and thicken with swirling white  gabriel wrapped in his inadequate blanket was hunched shivering and silent in his little seat jonas stopped the bike wearily lifted the child down and realized with heartbreak how cold and weak gabe had become  standing in the freezing mound that was thickening around his numb feet jonas opened his own tunic held gabriel to his bare chest and tied the torn and dirty blanket around them both gabriel moved feebly against him and whimpered briefly into the silence that surrounded them  dimly from a nearly forgotten perception as blurred as the substance itself jonas recalled what the whiteness was  its called snow gabe jonas whispered snowflakes they fall down from the sky and theyre very beautiful  there was no response from the child who had once been so curious and alert jonas looked down through the dusk at the little head against his chest gabriels curly hair was matted and filthy and there were tearstains outlined in dirt on his pale cheeks his eyes were closed as jonas watched a snowflake drifted down and was caught briefly for a moments sparkle in the tiny fluttering eyelashes  wearily he remounted the bicycle a steep hill loomed ahead in the best of conditions the hill would have been a difficult demanding ride but now the rapidly deepening snow obscured the narrow road and made the ride impossible his front wheel moved forward imperceptibly as he pushed on the pedals with his numb exhausted legs but the bicycle stopped it would not move  he got off and let it drop sideways into the snow for a moment he thought how easy it would be to drop beside it himself to let himself and gabriel slide into the softness of snow the darkness of night the warm comfort of sleep  but he had come this far he must try to go on  the memories had fallen behind him now escaping from his protection to return to the people of his community were there any left at all could he hold onto a last bit of warmth did he still have the strength to give could gabriel still receive  he pressed his hands into gabriels back and tried to remember sunshine for a moment it seemed that nothing came to him that his power was completely gone then it flickered suddenly and he felt tiny tongues of heat begin to creep across and into his frozen feet and legs he felt his face begin to glow and the tense cold skin of his arms and hands relax for a fleeting second he felt that he wanted to keep it for himself to let himself bathe in sunlight unburdened by anything or anyone else  but the moment passed and was followed by an urge a need a passionate yearning to share the warmth with the one person left for him to love aching from the effort he forced the memory of warmth into the thin shivering body in his arms  gabriel stirred for a moment they both were bathed in warmth and renewed strength as they stood hugging each other in the blinding snow  jonas began to walk up the hill  the memory was agonizingly brief he had trudged no more than a few yards through the night when it was gone and they were cold again  but his mind was alert now warming himself ever so briefly had shaken away the lethargy and resignation and restored his will to survive he began to walk faster on feet that he could no longer feel but the hill was treacherously steep he was impeded by the snow and his own lack of strength he didnt make it very far before he stumbled and fell forward  on his knees unable to rise jonas tried a second time his consciousness grasped at a wisp of another warm memory and tried desperately to hold it there to enlarge it and pass it into gabriel his spirits and strength lifted with the momentary warmth and he stood again gabriel stirred against him as he began to climb  but the memory faded leaving him colder than before  if only he had had time to receive more warmth from the giver before he escaped maybe there would be more left for him now but there was no purpose in ifonlys his entire concentration now had to be on moving his feet warming gabriel and himself and going forward  he climbed stopped and warmed them both briefly again with a tiny scrap of memory that seemed certainly to be all he had left  the top of the hill seemed so far away and he did not know what lay beyond but there was nothing left to do but continue he trudged upward  as he approached the summit of the hill at last something began to happen he was not warmer if anything he felt more numb and more cold he was not less exhausted on the contrary his steps were leaden and he could barely move his freezing tired legs  but he began suddenly to feel happy he began to recall happy times he remembered his parents and his sister he remembered his friends asher and fiona he remembered the giver  memories of joy flooded through him suddenly  he reached the place where the hill crested and he could feel the ground under his snowcovered feet become level it would not be uphill anymore  were almost there gabriel he whispered feeling quite certain without knowing why i remember this place gabe and it was true but it was not a grasping of a thin and burdensome recollection this was different this was something that he could keep it was a memory of his own  he hugged gabriel and rubbed him briskly warming him to keep him alive the wind was bitterly cold the snow swirled blurring his vision but somewhere ahead through the blinding storm he knew there was warmth and light  using his final strength and a special knowledge that was deep inside him jonas found the sled that was waiting for them at the top of the hill numbly his hands fumbled for the rope  he settled himself on the sled and hugged gabe close the hill was steep but the snow was powdery and soft and he knew that this time there would be no ice no fall no pain inside his freezing body his heart surged with hope  they started down  jonas felt himself losing consciousness and with his whole being willed himself to stay upright atop the sled clutching gabriel keeping him safe the runners sliced through the snow and the wind whipped at his face as they sped in a straight line through an incision that seemed to lead to the final destination the place that he had always felt was waiting the elsewhere that held their future and their past  he forced his eyes open as they went downward downward sliding and all at once he could see lights and he recognized them now he knew they were shining through the windows of rooms that they were the red blue and yellow lights that twinkled from trees in places where families created and kept memories where they celebrated love  downward downward faster and faster suddenly he was aware with certainty and joy that below ahead they were waiting for him and that they were waiting too for the baby for the first time he heard something that he knew to be music he heard people singing  behind him across vast distances of space and time from the place he had left he thought he heard music too but perhaps it was only an echo      one      mother  there was no reply she hadnt expected one her mother had been dead now for four days and kira could tell that the last of the spirit was drifting away  mother she said it again quietly to whatever was leaving she thought that she could feel its leavetaking the way one could feel a small whisper of breeze at night  now she was all alone kira felt the aloneness the uncertainty and a great sadness  this had been her mother the warm and vital woman whose name had been katrina then after the brief and unexpected sickness it had become the body of katrina still containing the lingering spirit after four sunsets and sunrises the spirit too was gone it was simply a body diggers would come and sprinkle a layer of soil over the flesh but even so it would be eaten by the clawing hungry creatures that came at night then the bones would scatter rot and crumble to become part of the earth  kira wiped briefly at her eyes which had filled suddenly with tears she had loved her mother and would miss her terribly but it was time for her to go she wedged her walking stick in the soft ground leaned on it and pulled herself up  she looked around uncertainly she was young still and had not experienced death before not in the small twoperson family that she and her mother had been of course she had seen others go through the rituals she could see some of them in the vast foulsmelling field of leaving huddled beside the ones whose lingering spirits they tended she knew that a woman named helena was there watching the spirit leave her infant who had been born too soon helena had come to the field only the day before infants did not require the four days of watching the wisps of their spirits barely arrived drifted away quickly so helena would return to the village and her family soon  as for kira she had no family now nor any home the cott she had shared with her mother had been burned this was always done after sickness the small structure the only home kira had ever known was gone she had seen the smoke in the distance as she sat with the body as she watched the spirit of her mother drift away she had seen the cindered fragments of her childhood life whirl into the sky as well  she felt a small shudder of fear fear was always a part of life for the people because of fear they made shelter and found food and grew things for the same reason weapons were stored waiting there was fear of cold of sickness and hunger there was fear of beasts  and fear propelled her now as she stood leaning on her stick she looked down a last time at the lifeless body that had once contained her mother and considered where to go      kira thought about rebuilding if she could find help though help was unlikely it wouldnt take long to build a cott especially not this time of year summerstart when tree limbs were supple and mud was thick and abundant beside the river she had often watched others building and kira realized that she could probably construct some sort of shelter for herself its corners and chimney might not be straight the roof would be difficult because her bad leg made it almost impossible for her to climb but she would find a way somehow she would build a cott then she would find a way to make a life  her mothers brother had been near her in the field for two days not guarding katrina his sister but sitting silently beside the body of his own woman the shorttempered solora and that of their new infant who had been too young to have a name they had nodded to each other kira and her mothers brother in acknowledgment but he had departed his time in the field of leaving finished he had tykes to tend he and solora had two others in addition to the one that had brought about her death the others were still small their names yet of one syllable dan and mar perhaps i could care for them kira thought briefly trying to find her own future within the village but even as the thought flickered within her she knew that it would not be permitted soloras tykes would be given away distributed to those who had none healthy strong tykes were valuable properly trained they could contribute to family needs and would be greatly desired  no one would desire kira no one ever had except her mother often katrina had told kira the story of her birththe birth of a fatherless girl with a twisted legand how her mother had fought to keep her alive  they came to take you katrina said whispering the story to her in the evening in their cott with the fire fed and glowing you were one day old not yet named your onesyllable infant name  kir  yes thats right kir they brought me food and were going to take you away to the field  kira shuddered it was the way the custom and it was the merciful thing to give an unnamed imperfect infant back to the earth before its spirit had filled it and made it human but it made her shudder  katrina stroked her daughters hair they meant no harm she reminded her  kira nodded they didnt know it was me  it wasnt you yet  tell me again why you told them no kira whispered  her mother sighed remembering i knew i would not have another child she pointed out your father had been taken by beasts it had been several months since he went off to hunt and did not return and so i would not give birth again  oh she added perhaps they would have given me one eventually an orphan to raise but as i held youeven then with your spirit not yet arrived and with your leg bent wrong so that it was clear you would not ever runeven then your eyes were bright i could see the beginning of something remarkable in your eyes and your fingers were long and wellshaped  and strong my hands were strong kira added with satisfaction she had heard the story so often each time of hearing she looked down at her strong hands with pride  her mother laughed so strong they gripped my own thumb fiercely and would not let go feeling that fierce tug on my thumb i could not let them take you away i simply told them no  they were angry  yes but i was firm and of course my father was still alive he was old then four syllables and he had been the leader of the people the chief guardian for a long time they respected him and your father would have been a greatly respected leader too had he not died on the long hunt he had already been chosen to be a guardian  say my fathers name to me kira begged  her mother smiled in the firelight christopher she said you know that  i like to hear it though i like to hear you say it  do you want me to go on  kira nodded you were firm you insisted she reminded her mother  still they made me promise that you would not become a burden  i havent have i  of course not your strong hands and wise head make up for the crippled leg you are a sturdy and reliable helper in the weaving shed all the women who work there say so and one bent leg is of no importance when measured against your cleverness the stories you tell to the tykes the pictures you create with wordsand with thread the threading you do it is unlike any threading the people have ever seen far beyond anything i could do her mother stopped she laughed enough you mustnt tease me into flattery dont forget that you are still a girl and often willful and just this morning kira you forgot to tidy the cott even though you had promised  i wont forget tomorrow kira said sleepily snuggling against her mother on the raised sleeping mat she pushed her twisted leg into a more comfortable position for the night i promise      but now there was no one to help her she had no family left and she was not a particularly useful person in the village for everyday work kira helped in the weaving shed picking up the scraps and leavings but her twisted leg diminished her value as a laborer and even in the future as a mate  yes the women liked the fanciful stories that she told to amuse restless tykes and they admired the little threadings that she made but those things were diversions they were not work  the sky with the sun no longer overhead but sending shadows now into the field of leaving from the trees and thorn bushes at its edge told her that it was long past midday in her uncertainty she had lingered here too long carefully she gathered the skins on which she had slept these four nights guarding her mothers spirit her fire was cold ashes a blackened smudge her water container was empty and she had no more food  slowly using her stick she limped toward the path that led back to the village holding on to a small hope that she might still be welcome there  tykes played at the edge of the clearing scampering about on the mosscovered ground pine needles stuck to their naked bodies and in their hair she smiled she recognized each little one there was the yellowhaired son of her mothers friend she remembered his birth two midsummers ago and the girl whose twin had died she was younger than the yellowhaired one just toddling but she giggled and shrieked with the others playing catchmewhileimrunning tussling the toddlers slapped and kicked at each other grabbing toysticks flailing with their small fists kira remembered watching her childhood companions at such play preparing for the real scramble of adult life unable to participate because of her flawed leg she had watched from the sidelines with envy  an older child a dirtyfaced boy of eight or nine years still too young for puberty and the twosyllable name that he would receive looked over at her from the place where he was clearing underbrush and sorting the twigs into bundles for firestarting kira smiled it was matt who had always been her friend she liked matt he lived in the swampy disagreeable fen probably the child of a dragger or digger but he ran freely through the village with his disorderly friends his dog always at his heels often he stopped as now to do some chore or small job in return for a few coins or a sweet kira called a greeting to the boy the dogs bent tail matted with twigs and leaves thumped on the ground and the boy grinned in reply  so you be back from the field he said whats it like there scared was you did creatures come in the night  kira shook her head and smiled at him younger onesyllable tykes were not allowed in the field so it was natural that matt would be curious and a little in awe no creatures she reassured him i had fire and it kept them away  so katrina be gone now from her body he asked in his dialect people from the fen were oddly different always identifiable by their strange speech and crude manners they were looked down upon by most people but not by kira she was very fond of matt  she nodded my mothers spirit has gone she acknowledged i watched it leave her body it was like mist it drifted away  matt came over to her still carrying an armful of twigs he squinted at her ruefully and wrinkled his nose your cott is horrid burnt he told her  kira nodded she knew that her home had been destroyed though secretly she had hoped she was mistaken yes she sighed and everything in it my frame did they burn my threading frame  matt frowned i tried to save things but its mostly all burnt just your cott kira not like when theres a big sickness this time it just be your mum  i know kira sighed again in the past there had been sicknesses that spread from one cott to the next with many deaths when that happened a huge burning would take place followed by a rebuilding that became almost festive with the noise of workers smearing wet mud over the fitted wooden sides of new structures methodically slapping it into smoothness the charred smell of the burning would remain in the air even as the new cotts rose  but today there was no festivity there were only the usual sounds katrinas death had changed nothing in the lives of the people she had been there now she was gone their lives continued  with the boy still beside her kira paused at the well and filled her container with water everywhere she heard arguing the cadence of bickering was a constant sound in the village the harsh remarks of men vying for power the shrill bragging and taunting of women envious of one another and irritable with the tykes who whined and whimpered at their feet and were frequently kicked out of the way  she cupped her hand over her eyes and squinted against the afternoon sun to find the gap where her own cott had been she took a deep breath it would be a long walk to gather saplings and a hard chore to dig the mud by the riverbank the corner timbers would be heavy to lift and hard to drag i have to start building she told matt who still held a bundle of twigs in his scratched dirty arms do you want to help it could be fun if there were two of us  i cant pay you but ill tell you some new stories she added  the boy shook his head i be whipped iffen i dont finish the fire twiggies he turned away after a hesitation he turned back to kira and said in a low voice i heared them talking they dont want you should stay they be planning to turn you out now your mum be dead they be set on putting you in the field for the beasts they talk about having draggers take you  kira felt her stomach tighten with fear but she tried to keep her voice calm she needed information from matt and it would make him wary to know she was frightened whos they she asked in an annoyed superior tone  them women he replied i heared them talking at the well i be picking up wood chippies from the refuse and them didnt even notice me listening but they want your space they want where your cott was they aim to build a pen there to keep the tykes and the fowls enclosed so they dont be having to chase them all the time  kira stared at him it was terrifying almost unbelievable the casualness of the cruelty in order to pen their disobedient toddlers and chickens the women would turn her out of the village to be devoured by the beasts that waited in the woods to forage the field  whose was the strongest voice against me she asked after a moment  matt thought he shifted the twigs in his hands and kira could see that he was reluctant to get involved in her problems and fearful of his own fate but he had always been her friend finally looking around first to be certain he wouldnt be overheard he told her the name of the person with whom kira would have to do battle  vandara he whispered  it came as no surprise nonetheless kiras heart sank      buy the book   visit wwwhmhbookscom or your favorite
