i 23 apples of eris introduction  well here it is  the closest thing youre going to get to the real principia discordia without actually going out and stealing a copy and its totally free of charge so just pre tend you stole it we wont tell  we scanned every page of the loompanics edition of the principia discordia and yanked out everything we could not reproduce with text in pagemaker i swear this file couldnt be much smaller than it is right now and still cover the entire principia  we got into an argument among ourselves as to whether or not to include the steve jackson games editions pages at the end of this document and after much biting and spitting we decided to it makes the file bigger and were not exactly fans of steve jack son who steals discordian imagery like any good discordian would but then turns around and copyrights them but we figured some of you might want to see those additional pages enough to go out and purchase a copy and wed rather give it to you if you want us to illegally reproduce anything else they do let us know and we will attempt to procure and reproduce  anyway other than those pages everything else has been yanked out of the loompanics edition of the principia and everything is as close to the original as we could make it spelling errors and all when we couldnt find a font that was in the original we chose the next closest thing or used the image instead  its doggedly unneccessary for us to go into why we did it and so forth and so on if you went through the trouble of downloading this you already know why  a labor of love and all that shit prince muchao and happy fun ball deserve all the credit everyone else just watched them and giggled sometimes choking on the bong water especially when prince mu chao realized that happy fun ball had spent two hours scanning the pages that he had already scanned they reminded us of root beer i dont remember why at this time but im sure anyway i digress im running out of space  please excuse the shamefully blatent advertisements at the bottom of the page we promise this is the only page well clutter with them so our suggestion is to just throw this page out entirely  so without further ado just skip over the aforementioned shamefully blatent advertisements at the bottom of this page and go on to mr wilsons introduction its much more interesting than ours is i assure you

books are recognized at once with a fusillade of critical huzzahs and gonfolons like joyces ulysses others appear almost furtively and are only discovered 50 years later like moby dick or mendels great es say on genetics the principia discordia entered our spacetime continuum almost as unobtrusively as a catburglar creeping over a windowsill  in 1968 virtually nobody had heard of this wonderful book in 1970 hundreds of people from coast to coast were talking about it and asking the identity of the mysterious author malaclypse the younger rumors swept across the continent from new york to los angeles from seattle to st joe malaclypse was actually alan watts one heard no said another legend  the principia was actually the work of the sufi order a third very intriguing myth held that malaclypse was a penname for richard m nixon who had allegedly composed the principia during a few moments of lucidity i enjoyed each of these yarns and did my part to help spread them i was also careful never to contradict the occasional rumors that i had actually written the whole thing myself during an acid trip  the legendry the mystery the cult grew very slowly by the mid1970s thousands of people some as far off as hong kong and australia were talk ing about the principia and since the original was out of print by then xerox copies were beginning to circulate here and there  when the illuminatus trilogy appeared in 1975 my coauthor bob shea and i both received hundreds of  letters from people intrigued by the quotes from the principia with which we had decorated the heads of several chapters many who had already heard of the principia or seen copies asked if shea and i had written it or if we had copies available others wrote to ask if it were real or just something we had invented the way hp lovecraft invented the necronomicon we answered according to our moods sometimes telling the truth sometimes spreading the most godawful lies and myths we could devise fnord  why not we felt that this book was a true classic literatus immortalis and since the alleged intelligentsia had not yet discovered it the best way to keep its legend alive was to encourage the mythology and the controversy about it increasingly people wrote to ask me if timothy leary had written it and i almost always told them he had except on fridays when i am more whimsical in which case i told them it had been transmitted by a canine intel ligence  vast cool and unsympathetic  from the dog star sirius  now at last the truth can be told  actually the principia is the work of a timetraveling anthropologist from the 23rd century he is currently passing among us as a computer specialist bon vivant and philosopher named gregory hill he has also translated sev eral volumes of etruscan erotic poetry under another penname and in the 18th century was the mysterious man in black who gave jefferson the design for the great seal of the united states  i have it on good authority that he is one of the most accomplished time travelers in the galaxy and has visited earth many times in the past using such coveridentities as zeno of elias emperor norton count cagliostro guillaume of aquitaine etc whenever i question him about this he grows very evasive and attempts to persuade me that he is actually just another 20th century earthman and that all my ideas about his  extraterrestrial and extratemporal origin are delusions hah i am not that easily deceived after all a timetraveling anthropologist would say just that so that he could observe us without his presence causing cultureshock  i understand that he has consented to write an afterward to this edition hell probably contradict everything ive told you but dont believe a word he says fnord he is a master of

speak to those who live there you must remain silent until the moon rises tomorrow night go to the large room on the right of the main hallway sit in the lotus position on top of the rubble in the northeast corner face the corner and meditate  he did as the zen master instructed his meditation was fre quently interrupted by worries he worried whether or not the rest of the plumbing fixtures would fall from the second floor bathroom to join the pipes and other trash he was sitting on he worried how he would know when the moon rose on the next night he worried about what the people who walked through the room said about him  his worrying and meditation were disturbed when as if in a test of his faith ordure fell from the second floor onto him at that time two people walked into the room the first asked the second who the man sitting there was the second replied some say he is a holy man others say he is a shithead  hearing this the man was enlightened  00005  for deposit only

ken kesey took his first acid trip as a medical volunteer before underground newspapers viet nam and talk of a second american revolution in the comparative quiet of the late nineteenfifties just before the idea of renaissance became relevant  two young californians known later as omar ravenhurst and malaclypse the younger were indulging in their habit of sipping coffee at an allnight bowling alley and generally solving the worlds problems this particular evening the main subject of discussion was discord and they were complaining to each other of the personal confusion they felt in their respective lives solve the problem of discord said one the other chaos and strife are the roots of all confusion  first i must sprinkle you with fairy dust  suddenly the place became devoid of light then an utter silence enveloped them and a great stillness was felt then came a blinding flash of intense light as though their very psyches had gone nova then vision returned  the two were dazed and neither moved nor spoke for several minutes they looked around and saw that the bowlers were frozen like statues in a variety of comic positions and that a bowling ball was steadfastly anchored to the floor only inches from the pins that it had been sent to scatter the two looked at each other totally unable to account for the phenomenon the condition was one of suspension and one noticed that the clock had stopped  new story of chaos  00007  there walked into the room a chimpanzee shaggy and grey about the muzzle yet upright in his full five feet and poised with natural majesty he carried a

be done about heisenbergs law he paused somebody had to put all of this confusion here  and with that he revealed his scroll it was a diagram like a yinyang with a pentagon on one side and an apple on the other and then he exploded and the two lost consciousness  eris  goddess of chaos discord  confusion  they awoke to the sound of pins clattering and found the bowlers en gaged in their game and the waitress busy with making coffee it was appar ent that their experience had been private  they discussed their strange encounter and reconstructed from memory the chimpanzees diagram over the next five days they searched libraries to find the significance of it but were disappointed to uncover references only to taoism the korean flag and technocracy it was not until they traced the greek writing on the apple that they discovered the ancient goddess known to the greeks as eris and to the romans as discordia this was on the fifth night and when they slept that night each had a vivid dream of a splen did woman whose eyes were as soft as a feather and as deep as eternity itself and whose body was the spectacular dance of atoms and universes pyrotechnics of pure energy formed her

studied philosophies and theolo gies and learned that eris or discordia was primarily feared by the ancients as being disruptive indeed the very concept of chaos was still considered equivalent to strife and treated as a negative no wonder things are all screwed up they concluded they have got it all backwards they found that the principle of disorder was every much as significant as the

beliefs   the classical greeks were not influenced by the classical greeks  what we know about eris not much  the romans left a likeness of her for posterityshe was shown as a grotesque woman with a pale and ghastly look her garment is ripped and torn and as concealing a dagger in her bosom actually most women look pale and ghastly when concealing a chilly dagger in their bosoms  her geneology is from the greeks and is utterly confused either she was the twin of aries and the daughter of zeus and hera or she was the daughter of nyx goddess of night who was either the daughter or wife of chaos or both and nyxs brother erebus and whose brothers and sisters include death doom mockery misery and friendship and that she begat forgetfullness quarrels lies and a bunch of gods and goddesses like that  one day mal2 consulted his pineal gland and asked eris if she really created all of those terrible things she told him that she had always liked the old greeks but that they cannot be trusted

galbraith  the myth of the apple of discord  it seems that zeus was preparing a wedding banquet for peleus and thetis and did not want to invite eris because of her reputation as a trouble maker   this made eris angry and so she fashioned an apple of pure gold and inscribed upon it kallisti to the prettiest one and on the day of the fete she rolled it into the banquet hall and then left to be alone and joyously partake of a hot dog  now three of the invited goddesses athena hera and aphrodite each immediately claimed it to belong to herself because of the inscription and they started fighting and they started throwing punch all over the place and everything  finally zeus calmed things down and declared that an arbitrator must be selected which was a reasonable suggestion and all agreed he sent them to a shepherd of troy whose name was paris because his mother had had a lot of gaul and married a frenchman but each of the sneaky god desses tried to outwit the others by going early and offering a bribe to paris  athena offered him heroic war victories hera offered him great wealth and aphrodite offered him the most beautiful woman on earth being a healthy young trojan lad paris promptly accepted aphrodites bribe and she got the apple and he got screwed  as she had promised she maneuvered earthly happenings so that paris could have helen the helen then living with her husband menelaus king of sparta anyway everyone knows that the trojan war followed  2  when sparta demanded their queen back and that the trojan war is said to be the first war among men  and so we suffer because of the original snub and so a discordian is to partake of no hot dog buns  do you believe that   this is called the doctrine of the original snub   there is historic disagreement concerning whether this apple was of metalic gold or acapulco   actually there were five goddesses but the greeks did not know of the law of fives  remember king  kong died for your sins  	5	an age of

pleasure of that trip he had a sudden clear voice in his head saying it is bitter tea that involves you so hypoc heard the voice but the struggle inside intensified and the pattern previously established with the physical laboring and the muscle messages coordinated and unified or perhaps coded continued to exert their influence and hypoc succumbed to the pressure and denied the voice  and

bergan evans on norbert weiner nuclear physicist  the second concept wiener has to establish is that of entropy probabil ity is a mathematical concept coming from statistcs entropy comes from physics it is the assertion  established logically and experimentally  that the universe by its nature is running down moving toward a state of inert unifor mity devoid of form matter hierarchy or differentiation  that is in any given situation less organization more chaos is over whelmingly more probable than tighter organization or more order  the tendency for entropy to increase in isolated systems is expressed in the second law of thermodynamics   perhaps the most pessimistic and amoral formulation in all human thought  it applies however to a closed system to something that is an isolated whole not just a part within such systems there may be parts which draw their energy from the whole that are moving at least temporarily in the opposite direction in them order is increasing and chaos is diminishing  the whirlpools that swirl in a direction opposed to the main current are called enclaves and one of them is life especially human life which in a universe moving inexorably towards chaos moves toward increased order  personal  planetary pi which i discovered is 61 its a timeenergy relationship existing between sun and inner plants and i use it in arriving at many facts

the sacred chao is the key to illumination devised by the apostle hung mung in ancient china it was modified and popularized by the taoists and is sometimes called the yinyang the sacred chao is not the yinyang of the taoists it is the hodgepodge of the erisians and instead of a podge spot on the hodge side it has a pen tagon which symbolizes the aneristic principle and instead of a hodge spot on the podge side it depicts the golden apple of discordia to symbolize the eristic principle  the sacred chao symbolizes absolutely everything anyone need ever know about absolutely anything and more it even symbolizes everything not worth knowing depicted by the empty space surrounding the hodge podge  here follows some psychometaphysics if you are not hot for philosophy best just skip it  the aneristic principle is that of apparent order the eristic principle is that of apparent disorder both order and disorder are man made concepts and are artificial divisions of pure chaos which is a

grids a culture is a group of people  00049  must  2  with rather similar grids through a window we view chaos and relate it to the points on our grid and thereby understand it the order is in the

than others some more pleasant than others etc but none can be more true than any other  disorder is simply unrelated information viewed through some particular grid but like relation norelation is a concept male like female is an idea about sex to say that maleness is absence of femaleness or vice versa is a matter of definition and meta physically arbitrary the artificial concept of norelation is the eristic illusion  the point is that littlet truth is a matter of definition relative to the grid one is using at the moment and that capitalt truth meta physical reality is irrelevant to grids entirely pick a grid and through it some chaos appears ordered and some appears disor dered pick another grid and the same chaos will appear differently ordered and disordered  reality is the original

symbolism here have brought me to some observations of my own  eris spelled forepartaftwards is rise and spelled inside out is reis which is a unit of money albeit portugesebrazilian and no longer in use from this it may be concluded that eris has usurped eros god of erotic love in the eyes of those who read backwards which obviously made eros sore then she apparently embezzled the olympian treasury and went to brazil whereupon she opened a chain of whorehouses which certainly would get a rise from the male population i figure it to be this in particular because madam reads the same

named eris and one the larger was of nonbeing named aneris to this day the fundamental truth that aneris is the larger is apparent to all who compare the great number of things that do not exist with the comparatively small number of things that do exist  eris had been born pregnant and after 55 years goddesses have an unusually long gestation period longer even than elephants her pregnancy bore the fruits of many things these things were composed of the five basic elements sweet boom pungent prickle and orange aneris however had been created sterile when she saw eris enjoying herself so greatly with all of the existent things she  a  had borne aneris became jelous and finally one day she stole some existent things and changed them into nonexistent things and claimed them as her own children this deeply hurt eris who felt that her sister was unjust being so much larger anyway to deny her her small joy and so she made herself swell again to bear more things and she swore that no matter how many of her begotten that aneris would steal she would beget more and in return aneris swore that no matter how many existent things eris brought forth she would eventually find them and turn them into nonexistent things for her own and to this day things appear and disappear in this very manner  2  00057  at first the things brought forth by eris were in a state of chaos and went in every which way but by the by she began playing with them and ordered some of them just to see what would happen some pretty things arose from the play and for the next five zillion years she amused herself by creating order and so she grouped some things with others and some groups with others and big groups with little groups and all combi nations until she had many grand schemes which delighted her  engrossed in establishing order she finally one day noticed disorder previously not apparent because everything else was chaos there were many ways in which chaos was ordered and many ways in which it was not  hah she thought here shall be a new game  and she taught order and disorder to play with each other in contest games and to take turns amusing each other she named the side of disorder after herself eristic because being is anarchic and then in a mood of sympathy for her lonely sister she named the other side aneristic which flattered aneris and smoothed the friction a little that was between them  now all of this time void was somewhat disturbed he felt unsatisfied for he had created only physical existence and physical nonexistence and had neglected the spiritual as he contemplated this a great quiet was caused and he went into a state of deep sleep which lasted for 5 eras at the end of this ordeal he begat a brother to eris and aneris that of spirituality who had no name at all  3  when the sisters heard this they both confronted void and pleaded that he not forget them his first born and so void decreed thus  that this brother having no form was to reside with aneris in nonbeing and then to leave her and so that he might play with order and disorder reside with eris in being but eris became filled with sorrow when she heard this and then began to weep  why are you so despondent demanded void your new brother will have his share with you but father aneris and i have been arguing and she will take him from me when she discovers him and cause him to return to nonbeing i see  replied void then i decree the following  when your brother leaves the residence of being he shall not reside again in nonbeing but shall return to me void from whence he came you girls may bicker as you wish but my son is your brother and we are all of myself  and so it is that we as men do not exist until we do and then it is that we play with our world of existent things and order and disorder them and so it shall be that nonexistence shall take us back from existence and that nameless spirituality shall return to the void like a tired child home from a very

the contrary let n be the even number of persons and let their names be replaced by the integers 0 to n  1 in such a way that the place cards are numbered in sequence around the table if a delegate d originally sits down to a place card p then the table must be rotated r steps before he is correctly seated where r  p  d unless this is negative in which case r  p  d  n the collec tion of values of d and of p for all delegates is clearly the integers 0 to n1 each taken once but so also is the collection of values of r or else two delegates would be correctly seated at the same time summing the

essential positivenegative polarity instead of building a game founda tion with creativedestructive as the essential positivenegative he has thereby caused man to endure the destructive aspects of order and has pre vented man from effectively participating in the creative uses of disorder civilization reflects this unfortunate division  poee proclaims that the other division is preferable and

absolutely require an aneristic setting to function and that a timely introduction of eristic vibrations will neutralize their foundation the turkey curse is designed solely to counteract negative aneristic vibes and if introduced into a neutral or positive aneristic setting like a poet working out word rhythms it will prove harmless or at worst simply annoying it is not designed for use against negative eristic vibes although it can be used as an eristic vehicle to introduce positive vibes into a misguided eristic setting in this instance it would be the responsibility of the erisian magician to manufacture the positive vibrations if results are to be achieved caution  all magic is powerful and requires courage and integrity on the part of the magician this ritual if misused can

greater poop stopped publishing head temple closed down and the cabal just seemed to evaporate finally even the box was closed but over the years i noticed that copies were still circulating and that independent discordian cabals would occasionally pop out of nowhere and still do and i would wonder what ever happened to malaclypse  when i read the illuminatus trilogy i resolved to again find and interview the denizens of joshua norton cabal of the discordian society  791126 1 loompanics  norton cabal interview  g skripto    as i cabled over nob to san franciscos station o post office i couldnt help but wonder at goddess hand in assigning street addresses to her outposts mal2 had told me that good lord omar always filed everything under o for out of file  maya is marvelous i was thinking when i rapped on the little metal door and was greeted warmly by a huge beard who introduced himself as professor ignotius he ushered me into a spacious wood paneled and tapestry hung parlor where three others were laughing and passing around a wine jug the sunny one in a tunic was the reverend doctor occupant the trim khaki and jeans was mad malik and the wine jug claimed to be hill i got the recorder on   gypsie skripto in response to a question 1969 but only briefly i guess i missed you guys  mad malik no wonder he was pretty much a one man show then we were just his students and were usually off on errands you worked for the poop  gypsie well for one night anyway the interview is in the principia  rev dr occupant malik was the only one he would ever let write for the poop or get on the letterhead  gypsie did you malik have higher authority than the others  malik no but i was allowed to speak in the poop because malaclypse the younger hated politics he was infuriated with johnson and nixon over viet nam because it was turning the renaissance into a political revolution and was stealing his sacred thunder so he trained me in zenarchy which he learned from omar and i was the official anarchopacifist for the cabal also i was liaison to the ancient illuminated seers of bavaria the chicago discordians later omar activated the hung mung cong tong and elf on zenarchist principles and also operation mindfuck i was also into those though at that time i was masquerading in greater poop as a cremated cabbage to throw off the fbi  gypsie to hill since you wrote it i take it you are an anarchist  791126 2 loompanics  norton cabal interview g skripto  gh hill since then i have given up anarchy too many ruleshating the government and all that stuff  ignotum per ignotius its like hating your own fantasies  malik anarchy is also standing up and proceeding forward fantasy rule or not the condition is the same  occupant brother needs some wine  malik we have had this argument before reverend doctor brother but wine before platitudes fill it up  gypsie to hill and pacifism  hill im not sure i ever was one mal2 was not malik was personally i accepted self defense yet i could never reconcile that with the ideal i finally gave up on that one too actually i just gave up on idealism  ignotius idealism lives with rules realism lives with rocks  hill yeah i get along better with rocks  malik mal2 once told me that pacifism was a dilemma if everybody was a pacifist then everything would be perfect but nobody is going to be a pacifist unless i am first but if i am and somebody else is not then i get screwed he said that there were five choices under that circumstance the first was napalming farmers and the second was execut ing your parents the third was hypocrisy the fourth was cowardice and the fifth was to swallow the dilemma zenarchists are trained in dilemma swallowing  occupant so are other erisians like poee  ignotius that is characteristic of the discordian perspective  hill but of course training contradicts discordian principles  malik oh so what contradictions are nothing to discordians  occupant dilemma schlimemma to gypsie what do you think of this pretty maam we dont get to hear your thoughts  gypsie im reporting now you talk  occupant later then 791126 3 loompanics  norton cabal interview gypsie perhaps later  occupant you are smiling gypsie hey guy later to hill doesnt this leave you a little schizy  hill its ok im half gemini  gypsie whats the other half  hill taurus that makes me stubborn schizy  ignotius im a whale  occupant i choose satyr  malik spirits dont have signs  hill a character can have a sign if i want it so  occupant well i can have a sign if i want to and screw both of you  malik come on greg you just think that we are your characters  g skripto  occupant you were inhabited by malaclypse the younger he caused you to create roles and those roles are being performed by us spirits  ignotius a perfectly normal pagan relationship  hill well you can look at it like that if you want to but i created mal2 to my specifica tions just as i conceived all the rest of you  occupant you didnt invent eris she caused you to think you created the spirit of malaclypse  hill oh bull besides i changed her so much the greeks would never recognize her occupant thats what she wanted  ignotius deities change things around all the time malik what you dont realize is that a spirit has a self identity  hill nope a spirit is a product of definition and the one who is doing the defining  around here is me your identity is what i say it is just to prove it im going to change  your name  791126 4 loompanics  norton cabal interview g skripto  sinister dexter its ok with me fate is fate i never much liked mad malik anyway  ignotius besides people confused him with joe malik in illuminatus dexter i sort of enjoyed the confusion part occupant doesnt prove anything anyway gypsie that name sounds familiar where is it from  hill its a name i came up with in the old days and never used much its on page 38 of the principia referring to vice president spiro agnew i always thought i invented it but now it sounds like a stan freberg name now that i think about it it may have stuck in my preconscious memory from early tv  gypsie can you use it without his permission  hill if it is his i dont know i hope so it means left right in latin and is a perfect name for a libertarian anarchist actually in my kind of art the question of what can i use freely and what can i not is a very trickly problem  gypsie how do you mean  hill well take a collage for example like the early one on page 36 of the principia each little piece was extracted from some larger work created by some other artist and published and maybe copyrighted i find them in newspapers and magazines mostly often from ads with a collage you select and extract from your environment and then assemble into an original relationship  the principia itself is a collage a conceptual collage all of it happens simulta neously but visually it is a montage passing through time like a book does  there is a lot of pirated stuff in the principia especially in the margins but also i sympathize with artists who must own and sell their works to earn a living art like knowledge should be free fodder for everyone but it isnt it is perplexing  gypsie where did all the things in principia come from  hill well a full answer would take a whole book in itself most of the writing cred ited to a name is a true person and almost always a different name means a differ ent person most of the noncredited you know  791126 5 loompanics  norton cabal interview g skripto  malaclypse text is mine although some things credited to either mal2 or omar were actually cowritten and passed back and forth and rewritten by each of us the marginalia dingbats and pasted in titles and heads and things came from wherever i found themsome of which is original but uncredited discordian output like the page head on 12 and other pages which is from a series of satiric memo pads from our peoples underworld cabal all page layout is mine and some whole graphics like the sacred chao and the hodge podge transformer are mine but mostly i just found stuff and integrated it mostly i did concept say 50 of the writing 10 of the graphics all of the layout  gypsie specifically what are some of the sources  hill well the poem on the front cover is by walt kelly and was spoken by one of his characters in pogo the government seals starting on page 1 are from a book of sample seals from the us government printing office western union on page 6 got into the act because i used to be a teletype operator and had access to blank forms rubber stamps came from all over the place and some like the apple on page 27 i carved myself a few i ordered to my specification like on page 1 the quote on top of page 8 might be from barnum im not sure the jumping man on page 12 is from an advertisement i recognize the stylea popu lar commercial artistbut i dont know his name the chinese on that page is a grocery ad i think the norton money on page 14 is historic plus my little addi tions the apple on page 17 as well as the triangle on 23 and the sacred chao on 50 are believe it or not pasteups from mimeoqraphs from seattle cabal that group produced the best damn mimeography ive ever seen the lick here box on page 23 is one of many tidbits making the rounds in alternativeunderground newspapers in those days trip 5 page header on 29 was a chapter title in one of tim learys books the knight on the bull with the tv antenna on his helmet on page 46 came from a very artistic magazine called horseshit and put out by two brothers from long beach i dont remember their names wonderful magazine  occupant eris told mal2 what to use and where to find it  hill yeah in a way that is right that is why my name does not appear anywhere on the principia and why it was published with a broken copyrightreprint what you like i knew i was taking liberties and didnt want my intentions to be misun derstood it was an experiment and was intended to be an underground work and that involves a different set of ethics than commercial work  gypsie there are no real names at all  791126 6 loompanics  norton cabal interview g skripto  hill oh some camden benares is a real name because he legally changed his original name to his holy name also instead of using mordecai malignatus i used bob wilsons real name on page 12 because werewolf bridge was a work before discordianism and of course real people like neils bohr crop up in quotes  gypsie what do you think about the principia now would you want to change it  hill i consider it a successful work and i wouldnt want to change it in some ways it is immature and i am not the same person i was 10 years ago but it accom plished the objectives i set for myself and it has the effect i wanted it to have there are a few errors though  gypsie like what  hill oh i changed a quote from tom gnostic on page 61 and i dont think he ever did forgive me for it hes right starbucks pebbles should have been preceded by the myth of starbuck which was being saved for something else and never got used i should have used it when i had the chance and then eris did a neat little trick on me by having ibm make the greek selectric typewriter element not coin cide with all the characters on their keyboard so the little kallisti that first ap pears on the title page and lastly on the back cover came out kallixti and i was too dumb to know the difference  gypsie will there ever be a fifth edition  hill there already is a fifth edition by mal2 it is a one page telegram that re duces everything to an infinite aum i found it at western union where a machine got stuck and kicked out hundreds of pages of nothing but ms he made it the fifth edition and then left  principiamalaclypse was a very personal work for me and actually took 10 years to culminate it was one single statement that included my adolescence in the 50s and my young adulthood in the 60s when i finally had the pasteups done i knew that i had finished it that is why quote malaclypse left i knew it was finished i didnt know exactly what it was but it was done  occupant see  gypsie earlier you said that you met your objectives just what were those objec tives  hill well thats hard to answer because it kept refining itself over the years in 1969 i mainly  791126 7 loompanics  norton cabal interview g skripto  thought of myself as a cosmic clown and i set out to prove by demonstration that a deity can be anything at all  in other words people invent gods and not the other way around later i decided that i was doing some kind of conceptual art  in the 50s my culture taught me that i was created by and for a deity a specific male deity and that all other deities are false yet my growing experience showed me that any deity is true in some sense and false in some other sense so i set out to do what my society told me is impossiblemake a real religion from a patently absurd deity  in the 50s a female deity was blasphemy in the 70s a humorous deity is still consid ered impossible ridiculous and blasphemous as far as im concerned i have proven my point eris is a real deity and even though i dont promote erisianism as a serious religion   occupant i do  dexter you speak for yourself  ignotius here here  hill i do point out that it makes just as much sense from its own perspective as all the others do from each of their own perspectives  occupant i think paganism is a valid spiritual path i encourage erisianism because it makes fun of itself i think this is healthy  ignotius if you can live rewardingly with goddess eris you can live with any deity including none or all  dexter i dont much go for the worship business but i agree with occupant about the spirit of the thing we live in a time of turmoil the whole planet is in a state of change if we as a species cower from the confusion then we die with the dying this is revolu tion  ignotius i am an athiest myself there is no greg hill   laughter   gypsie to hill what do you think of illuminatus  hill oh i love it i was finishing principia when shea and wilson were working on illuminatus it took  791126 8 loompanics  norton cabal interview g skripto  dell five years to publish itmaybe that is significant the 1969 discordian society was a mail network between independent writers of various kinds norton cabal was just me and my characters and i used the other cabals as sort of a laboratory in return other discordians would bounce their stuff off of me we would toss in ideas and anybody could take anything out it was a concept stew the exchanging of ideas and tech niques broadened and encouraged all of us  i like illuminatus for the surrealism a very effective method of writing ignotius i got misquoted worse i wasnt even in that scene and if i had been then i  would have said something else dexter to ignotius that was me in that scene ignotius oh is that what that was dexter he got our names mixed up  hill he got mixed up about me too in cosmic trigger bob says that when oswald was buying the assassination rifle my girlfriend was printing the first edition of principia on jim garrisons xerox it wasnt my girl friend it was kerrys it wasnt the first ed principia it was some earlier discordian thoughts it wasnt garrisons xerox it was his mimeograph and it wasnt just before kennedy was shot but a couple of years before that  the first ed principia by the way was reproduced at xerox corp when xerography was a new technology which was my second new orleans trip in 1965 i worked for a guy on bourbon street who was a xerox salesman by day  dexter i think that george dorn took too much guff from hagbard if someone pulls a weapon on me im more inclined to either leave or kill the sonofabitch  occupant you are supposed to be a pacifist dexter im speaking figuratively of course ill tell you more tomorrow     i checked this further with mr thornley he says that the woman in question was not his girlfriend she was just a friend and it wasnt a couple of years before kennedy was shot but had to be a couple of years after but before garrison investigated thornley gs  791126 9 loompanics  norton cabal

have only one question left ill get it  gypsie office box  what i really want to know is how can we all fit inside of a tiny little post  dexter to gypsie its a telegram for you from mal2 gypsie to me paper tearing  gypsie reading if i told everybody how they could live inside of a post office box then everybody would stop paying landlords and go live inside their post office boxes it would collapse the building can you imagine post offices collapsing all over the country the hemisphere the planet the whole worlds communication system would be destroyed no no i must not say i dare not

added to the holy book by steve jackson games when they released the principia again in 1994 admittedly nobody in our cabal owns an illuminet press copy of the principia so we dont know if there were any aditional pages there that we were unable to include  but after the steve jackson pages we included the text for the fifth edition in troduction written by kerry thornley in the interest of more

it usually takes place when you can get a shitload of gourds gourdfest is a simple ceremony that can be performed by at least 5 discordians and with 25 gourds 255  5 each gourd must be cut to hold at least one candle once the gourds are prepared place them on the ground so they form a large circle when night falls light all of the gourds and build a fire in the middle of the circle once the fire is burning and all of the candles are lit everyone present must enter the circle and chant hunda howdahundahowda gourd this is primarily to scare the neighbors  the ceremony invokes the primal chaos

masses then disorganized religion is the marijuana of the lunatic fringe  most disorganized of all religions discordianism alone understands that organization is the work of the devil holy chaos is the natural condition of reality contrary to popular belief theologian cite order in the universe as proof of a supreme intellegence but a glance is enough to see that the stars are not actually in neat little rows oh sure there is the big dipper and the little dipper  but if they were really connect thedot drawings there would be numbers next to the stars theology is just a debate over who to frame for creating reality what we imagine is order is merely the prevailing form of chaos  every few thousand years some shepard inhales smoke from a burning bush and has a vision or eats moldy rye bread in a cave and sees god from then on their followers kill one another at the slightest provocation haunted houses called temples are built by one side and torn down by another  and then bloody quarrels continue over the crumbling foundations  organized religion preaches order and love but spawns chaos and fury why  because the whole material universe is exclusive property of the grecoroman goddess of chaos confusion strife helterskelter and hodge podge no spiritual power is even strong enough to dent her chariot fenders no material force can resist the temptation of her fifth intergalactic bank of the acropolis slush fund for graft and corrup tion  all this was revealed to me in an absolutely unforgettable miraculous event in 1958 or 1959 in a bowling alley in friendly hills or maybe santa fe springs california witnessed by either gregory hill or malaclypse the younger or perhaps mad malik or reverend doctor occupant or some guy who must have vaguely resembled one or another of them  with the help of a chaosophers stone i found the goddess eris discordia in my pineal gland on cosmic channel number five and ever since i have known the answers to all the mysteries of metaphysics metamystics metamorhpics metanoiacs and metaphorics before that i didnt even know how to install a plastic trash can liner so it wouldnt fall down inside the first time somebody threw away garbage  you too can activate your pineal gland simply by reciting the entire contents of this book upon awakening each morning rubbing sandalwood paste between your eyes each evening upon retiring banging your forehead against the ground five times a day refraining from harming cockroaches and meditating defined as sitting around waiting for good luck  when your pineal gland finally lights up you will never again as long as you live have to relax  eris discordia will solve all your problems and she will expect you in return to solve all her problems in these very pages you will learn about converting infidels later on you will be taught how to annoy heretics you will also be required to resolve zenlike riddles such as if jesus was jewish then why did he have a puerto rican name  once you become adept at leaning on backsliders you will qualify for a calling maybe you will be a chaosopher who delivers commentaries on chaos or perhaps instead a chaoist who goes around stirring up chaos or perchance a knower whoknows better than to do either one  but under no circumstances may you become a prophet we dont intend to jepordize our nonprophet status  what we lack in prophets however we make up for in saints only a pope may canonize a saint but every man woman and child on this planet is a genuine and authorized pope genuine and authorized by the house of the apostles of eris so you can ordain yourself  and anyone or anything else  a saint  times werent always so easy when in 1968 i first declared myself a saint gregory hill said thats impos sible insisting only dead people can be saints adding and fictional characters guessing you are neither one but it happened that although i was no longer a believer i was still on the membership roles of the church of  jesus christ of latter day saints so greg was too late me and all the other mormons were already saints  and some of us living ones  no matter what he said  nowadays only the mormons have more saints than the discordian society but we plan to catch up with them wont you please join our sainthood drive moral perfection isnt necessary for discordian sainthood you just have to suffer a lot  nowadays only the mormons have more saints than the discordian society but we plan to catch up with them wont you please join our sainthood drive moral perfection isnt necessary for discordian sainthood you just have to suffer a lot  so many other privileges of membership in our religion come to mind that i dont know where to begin for instance you dont have to get out of bed early on sunday morning to attend church you can sleep in how many christian denominations  for all their talk of brotherly love  are that compassionate  you can even be a discordian in good standing without ever having to so much as look at another discordian  early in the morning or any other time thats an advantage to mailorder religion that the more conventional faiths try to play down  what is so unusual about discordian abnormail  as we call it  is decentralization dont contact me here at orthodox discordian society hindquarters send your letters notes relics sacraments and writs of excommunication to one another that says discordian episkopos ol sam 36 erskine drive morristown nj 07960 is erstic abnormail  adding unfortunately the majority of eristic abnormail is nothing but inane gossip masturbatory injokes trivial variations of stale dogma snide putdowns of those not weird in exactly the same was as us and similar such garbage ad naseum and thats good too i like the way ol sam always keeps a positive attitude  our outreach program is called aneristic abnormail and is defined by ol sam as weird things sent in fun to those still trapped in the region of thud  sqaures that is when some orderbound heathen makes an especially unenlightened public remark that unsuspecting dolt is likely to receive a jake  whole mail box full of weird shit from discordians everywhere on the same day for maximum benefit says ol sam a good jake should be in response to a particularly gross mainfestation of the aneristic delusion not merely intended to chastise but to teach and amuse as well or else make them hopping mad the best jakes involve a lot of discordians all conspiring to contact the subject on jake day  a shining example of discordian accord as pradoxical as that sounds if you think that sounds paradoxical wait until you hear about the discordian accordian  another advantage to discordianism over the worlds other great religions is that we tell you about the fendersons while it is true that you dont have to be a discordian before becoming a fenderson the taoists  for instance  dont even know about the fendersons and those who know do not speak  fenderson discordian graham trievel explains that a fenderson is a member of a family you can join by saying you are one yes anybody who wants to be a fenderson can be a fenderson just say these three words im a fenderson its as simple as that  genealogy buffs will be interested to know our fenderson forefather can be reached at  sj glew 5611 lehman road dewitt mi 48820  blame him  all fendersons add fenderson to their existing name or they use the last name of fenderson with entirely new first andor middle names for example you can call me graham fenderson trievel fenderson graham trievel or graham trievel fenderson and you can call me saint ignatius fenderson  but you must at all times keep in touch with other fendersons this says fenderson is easy to accomplish as you can make anybody you want a fenderson even if they dont want to be one  write graham fenderson trievel about how to get a 1989 fenderson family reunion baseball cap at rt 113 box 481 lionville pa 19353 but he warns ill be collecting names and addresses of fendersons for possible future publication  if you become a discordian and also want salvation in the industrial church of the subgenius box 140306 dallas tx 75214 you are free to mantain a duel membership or if you live outside of texas in some state where dueling is illegal you can be an honorary subgenius and a dishonorary discordian both at once  you might even say subgeniusism is our sister faith or brother religion  or at least our marinecorps buddy theology because jr bob dobbs was my marine corps buddy in atsugi japan where he distinguished himself by shooting his own toe while on guard duty  although he was only aiming for a fly on the tip of his boot dobbs want on to become a supersalesman and trance medium who until his untimely assassination channeled prescriptures that occasion ally mentioned eris discordia if not always as kindly as prudence would dictate  out of these prescriptures came the subgenius church  so named because you only qualify to join if you iq is below genius  a pipe in his mouth and a maniacal gleam in his eyes were trademarks of bob and so his fanatical cult sues for copyright violation anyone whose eyes gleam in a similar fashion other exciting features of the subgenii include their spirited quest for slack their brave determination to be overmen their understandable disgust with technoboredom their unblushing crass commercialism and their keen pride in their northern tibetan abominable snowman ancestry  you can find out more by sending them your bank account  if on the other hand you would rather join the bavarian illuminati you have to bury your bank account in a cigar box in your yard one of their underground agents will find it and contact you  our religion is so completely infiltrated with agents of the ancient illuminate seers of bavaria that if for instance you pass out fairplay forswitzerland flyers for us you are assured of rapid advancement to more important work for the illuminati  both the illuminatus trilogy by robert shea and robert anton wilson and the illuminati board game by steve jackson mention the discordian society almost as often as they speak of the nefarious bavarian conspirators themselves prestige of intimate association with the illuminati is enormous because they have absolutely ruled the whole world for the past five thousand years  unlike the illuminati who are everywhere the right reverand jesse sumpss first evangelical and unrepentant church of no faith is an exclusive discordian franchise upon receiving a precious mao button that said we must have faith in the pary and we must have faith in the masses sump exclaimed no faith no faith in the party no faith in the masses no faith in god and no faith in the ruling class and thus the first evangelical and unrepentant church of no faith began jesse sump has faith in eris discordia though because everybody has just got to believe in something  perhaps the chief difference between the discordian society and sumps outfit is one of style we got it they  dont  but if you like working yourself into a frenzy at camp meetings in order to foam at the mouth speak in tongues handle snakes run moonshine and experience phantasmagoria the no faith church will make you happy as a pig in mud  of couse all the highchurch glitter of the paratheoianametamystichood of eris esoteric is not just yours for the asking we solicit no donations demand no tithes charge no admission levy no poll tax and run only a few nifty religious novelty stores on the side but certain obligations adhere to the more hallowed manifestations of discordianship  eating hot dog buns is prohibited except on friday  when it is cumpulsory stepped on cockroaches will earn you no pointswith our blessed saint gulik you must discipline yourself under a certified slackmaster until you are capable of drinking beer and watching television with total concentration all bowling alleys are sacred to discordians and if necessary you must give your life to protect them from desecration  if anyone ever decides to desecrate bowling alleys finally you must not rest until all the sheep are brought into the fold and when we convert all the sheep we are going to the dogs next then wolves goats and at the annoited hour human beings  goddess also expects you to work on yourself you must devote your full attention to every task you perform so you will realise  in a flash of sudden enlightenment  how confusing it is you must master one little moron riddle after another until with years of study there is no longer any separation in your perception between subject and object between you and the little moron  then there are bigots who will persecute you because they hate eris discordia and have no better sense than to judge an entire religion by the behavior of a single deity  but before i was a discordian when i entered my room only to be reminded by its disarry that it was a mess i felt a sense of defeat these days when that happens i just say hail eris  our customary salute to any embodiment of chaos  and then i cheerfully carry on secure in the knowledge that the constellations look no better  before i was a discordian i wasted a lot of time arguing with evangelists about god and jesus now they waste a lot of time arguing about eris discordia with me  before i was a discordian i took life much too seriously when you take life too seriously you start to wonder what the point of it all is when you wonder what the point is in life you fall into a trap of thinking there is one when you think there is a point you finally realise there is no point and what point is there in living like that nowadays i skip the search for a point and find instead the punch lines  before i was a discordian i was distressed by the inefficiency and inhumanity of organizations now i am vindicated by their inefficiency and inhumanity  before i was a discordian i used to be afraid of my own shadow ah but now my shadow is afraid of me  having at last glimpsed the value of discordianism you are hereby ready to be awed by the importance of the little book you hold in your hands this very moment  five years of discordian society activity transpired before the first edition of principia discordia rolled off district attorney jim garrisons mimeograph machine without his knowledge in new orleans in 1964 that was the work of gregory hill and lane caplinger a discordian typist in the das office  during the next five years greg preoduced bigger and funnier editions with a little help from me but not as much as the enemies of our faith suspect  by no means is the principia our only scripture all along greg has been writing what he says is a summary of the universe but evidently it will be quite some time before he completes it additionally there are piles and piles of discordian leaflets and broadsides cranked out by zealous converts from everywhere  with new ones arriving in the mail each month  but goddess only knows where they all are now or remembers what they said there is also chaos broad sheets of ontologiccl anarchism by hakim bey grim reaper books of the unarmed expropriation committee of the john henry mckay society and bishop of persia in exile of the moorish orthodox church of amrerica but out most exalted testament of all is the honest book of truth  of which there is alas only one copy locked away in the closed stacks of the akashic records only qualified discordian episkoposes with activated pineal glands may copy passages from it  and these may only be published when they can be shown beyond a reasonable doubt to have redeeming social value such as by educating you or arousing purient interest  but this forth and fifth combined edition of principia discordia is unquestionably the most influential of all the great immortal works of signifigicant literature our classic greek goddess has inspired  who would even venture to guess how many wretched and thankless lives these few astonishing pages have deprived forever of meaningless purpose who can say how many seminarians read the principia and decided to change vocations and become clowns or many landlords it has caused to sell their estates and buy yachts or airplanes for smuggling marijuana or how many politicians it has inspired to vanish alone into the high mountains and become sagacious hermits or how many investment bankers it has turned into anarchists  slim brooks was just an ordinary merchant seaman dwelling in the new orleans french quarter until he read principia discordia the he became the mysterious keeper of the submarine keys who would never tell anyone what submarine or why it was locked  roger lovin was just a dashing talented and handsome con artist who was too shallow to settle into any one thing but for years and years after he read the principia under his discordian name of fang the unwashed he consis tently and with unswerving devotion to the task excommunicated every new person any of the rest of us initiated into the discordian society  robert anton wilson was just a playboy advisor who wrote safe and insipid answers to inquiries from readers about the size and present whereabouts of john dillingers penis until he read this remarkable tract then he became mord the malignant and wrote a whole library full of widely read books about the illuminati and how to make syncronicity work for you in finding quarters on the sidewalk  mike gunderloy was just a compulsive reader of fanzines until the fateful day he read principia discordia under the mistaken impression it was another fanzine now he is ukelele the short of the discordian society and big time publisher of factsheet five  elayne wechsler was just some broad with a funny bone until she read the principia and asked the question that led to my great definition of theology why she wanted to know is the discordian society which worships a female divinity so male dominated recalling that more women than men are devout about christianity with its male god and his male son i decided that people like religions that blame reality on the opposite sex so let that be a lesson to us males behind every great idea there is a broad with a funny bone  so there is no telling how much happier and better adjusted reading this book will make you principia discordia is both a psychological laxative and a spiritual corn plaster unsolicited testimonials can be mailed to me in care of out of order  the sectual organ of the orthodox discordian society  at box 5498 atlanta ga 30307  how discordianism will change you is not however the real question anybody can be changed by something they read no wit imagination creativity talent or energy is required for that much how will you change the discordian society is the real question  a question you should be asking yourself from page 00001 all the way through page 00075 a question you should keep asking yourself long after you reverently close the covers of principia discordia wrap it carefully in silk solemnly return it to its golden box and bow five times after resting it in its place of honor on your altar  most neophyte discordians are either too cautious or too serious they constantly ask permission to do this or that like there are rules hidden away somewhere in the folds of our robes of office or they labor at length over ponderous metaphysical schemata with no gags in them as if the sole ironclad rule of our society isnt that you have to be funny as much as possible and as often as possible  or else  but we are indulgent toward monks who catch on in due time seldom do i beat anyone with my trusty staff  and certainly never without their help  on the subject of personal encounters with other discordians  and sometimes even the most careful among us cannot avoid them  keep in mind the lodge grips of our disorder somewhere in the following pages you will learn the turkey curse among zen buddhists it is said when you meet another bodhisattva on the road greet him with neither words nor silence that leaves you with a vast selection of barnyard noises from which to choose  but as you crow like a rooster or quack like a duck or moo like a cow scrutinize your brother or sister discordian with alert interest  never cracking a smile  to see how he or she will respond an oinking reply that is too loud indicates a swaggering bravado which falls short of mature eristic enlightenment but that is far better than a feeble and spiritless neigh  perhaps best of all is simply uttering a mondo that is like picking up the telephone when it rings and saying wrong number please however much you think about a mondo it makes no sense  even clamps and pliers cannot get hold of it yet at the same time if it is a good mondo the longer you think about it the more it seems light it ought to make sense  although you can never figure out why beyond that much a truly great mondo sticks to your mind like hot pine pitch  gumming up your thought process for weeks on end  when the zen master joshu was still a monk his master  nansen  struck him in answer to some dumb remark or other joshu grabbed nansens arm glared at the master and said from now on do not hit people by mistake nansen replied as follows the whole world can tell a snake from a dragon but you cannot fool a zen monk thats a genuinely great mondo  from this much you can see why meeting other discordians in person can be harrowing besides the pen is only mighter than the sword at a range greater than five feet when the subgenius church held its first devival reverand ivan  stang of the dallas clench expressed suprise at how nice and polite all the fans of his dobbswork were adding its almost disappointing still the wise take no unnecessary chances  as you can tell we are much indebted to other religions not only subgeniusism and zen and taoism have inspired us but also zoroastrianism  which practiced fire worship we too pay homage to fire in certain circumstances  such as when it is burning the writings of false prophets or is producing inhalable quantities of cannabis smoke our tradition is rooted in a medievil rite called the mass of the travesty in which marijuana was the sacrament according to the emperor wears no clothes by jack herer the mass of the travesty can be liked to a mel brooks second city tv monty python or saturday night live  eg father guido sarducci type group  doing irreverent farcical or satirical takeoffs on the dogmas doctrine indulgences and rituals of the rc ch mass andor its absolute beliefs unfortu nately the humorless roman catholic church authorities of the 15th century thought the mass of the travesty was heretical  and that was the true story of how marijuana got its bad name which it has never since been able to shake off  actually the mass of the travesty may have been a disguised remnant of the original greek discordianism for history indicates there must have been among those ancient ones erisian mysteries but if so they were never solved eris tells us they existed and were the work of malaclypse the elder a mystery writer by trade who also tutored the philosopher diogenes in lamp maintenance barrel keeping rock rolling public masturbation and cynicism  until diogenes was with it enough to fend for himself  no outpouring of gratitude would be complete without acknowledging the desert religions of the middle east which keep that part of the world alive with action to this day  and from which we inherited our fanatical dtermination to be at all times right or wrong as unreasonable as possible translated into latin this commitment is the motto on our coins seals rings plaques and tomb stones semper non sequitur  much of our grandeur is also derived from hinduism from the aryan mystery cult we aquired our soma drinking habit soma in turn fortified us with the confidence that we are better than people who look different than us from verdanta we learned how to sanskrit our temple walls tantra taught us our many strange sex secrets that staying up all night to smoke ganga and dance and sing can be passed off as religious activity was something we learned from the bauls of bengal but surely the cult of kali cosmic mother giver and taker of life resembles discordianism most we asked eris about this and she said kali is short for the greek kallisti which was engraved on the partycrashing golden apple of discord dealt with later on in this informative volume she added that her own full name is actually eris kallisti discordia but took the fifth amendment when we asked if this means she and kali are one in the same  our borrowings from christianity are so obvious that mention of them is almost insulting to whatever modicum of intellegence you possess but from that tradition we gained our crafty distrust of the reality principle as well as the rather singular notion of an only begotten son  we asked goddess if she like god had an only begotten son she assured us that she did and gave his name as emperor norton i  whom we assumed was probably some byzantine ruler of canstantinople dilligent research eventually turned up the historical norton as we call him in the holy city of san francisco  where he walked his faithful dog along market street scarcely more than a century ago  gregory hill has since become the worlds foremost authority on joshua a norton who on september 17th of 1859 crowned himself the emperor of the united states and protector of mexico just before then he vanished for a number of days  perhaps into the wilderness where maybe he was tempted by the devil probably to organize his life and get his affairs in order  certainly they looked like thats what they needed for on the day before his disappearance norton heretofore little more than a successful businessman cornered the rice market  only to be foiled by the unscheduled arrival of a whole shipload of rice from the orient a lesser man would have been thrown out of step by that event which for him became a step to the throne  when the us congress failed to obey his majestys royal order to assemble in the san francisco opera house norton fired every last member of that rebellious organization thus the people of san francisco knew better than to incute his imperial wrath his royal decrees were printed free of charge in the newspapers the currency he issued was accepted in the saloons local shopkeepers paid the modest taxes he occasionally demanded and on at least one occasion a tailor furnished him with a new set of royal finery  although a madman norton wrote letters to abraham lincoln and queen victoria which they took seriously  one night a gang of vigilantes gathered for a pogrom against san franciscos chinatown all that stood in their way was the solitary figure of norton a sane man would not have been there in the first place a rational man would have tried to reason with them a moralist would have scolded them a man as daft as norton usually seemd would have loudly ordered them to cease and desist in the name of his royal imperial authority all such tacks would probably have been futile and norton resorted to none of them  he simply bowed his head in silent prayer the vigilantes dispersed discordians believe everybody should live like norton  so write your legislative representatives demanding harsh laws with teeth in them requiring people of all faiths  especially christians and especially on sunday  to live as joshua a norton did  about five years ago i had a dream in which someone was yelling signs in the sky when i looked up i saw balloons and blimps carrying aloft big neon letters that said norton died want no dead  but when emperor norton died tens of thousands of san franciscans flocked to his full masonic funeral pilgrimages to his grave are still common  perhaps occasionally the soul of emperor norton descends once more into the world to momentarily inhabit the body of an otherwise undistinguished infidel one day i was sitting in a hamburger stand in rundown midtown atlanta a burnedout speed freak at a nearby table looked at me with a pleasant smile and said im king of the universe i dont know what im doing in a place like this  and perhaps thats the big attraction of our faith if you want you can be king of the universe jesse sump is ancient abbreviated calif of california i am bull goose of limbo and president of the fairplayfor switzerland committee camden benares is pretender to the throne of lesbos greg hill is polyfather of virginityingold sabal etonia is high constable of constantinople you can declare yourself archbishop of abyssinia or curator of the moon  we dont care but your mailman will be impressed  according to la rollins in lucifers lexicon a discordian is one who likes to wear emperor nortons old clothes if anything could be added to that definition i cannot think what  as i indicated earlier my own background is mormon since few are familiar with the offbeat creeds of that unusual sect mormonism doesnt land itself to broad satire readily yet the temptation is forever with me to swipe such startling rituals as say baptism of the dead  based on the rule that you cannot enter the celestial kingdom unless you name is recorded in salt lake city all who passed away without the benefit  at any time in the past  must for their own good be sooner or later baptised so strong a conviction is this among the saints that when my uncle died and left a lot of unpaid bills my aunt lena made off with his church records one day while doing volunteer secretarial work secure in the faith his soul would be locked outside the pearly gates until or unless she brought them back  but mormon baptism of the dead is a copout because in spite of stressing the importance of complete physical immersion for the living they dunk the deceased by proxy a discordian church of ladder night saints could open graves for the purpose of submurging skeletons and corpses then it could lower them back down before dawn that would give us an exciting mission which would heighten our commitment by inviting persecution  a function served in the early days of latter day saint church history by polygamy  technically the mormons practiced only polygyny  one husband with a plurality of wives polyandry  one wife with more than one husband  is also a form included by the generic term of polygamy discordians are free to practice all varieties of polygamy and polymorphous perversity as well marriage is an institution which should adjust itself to the needs of individuals and not the other way around any discordian episkopos may perform group marriage ceremonies shortduration marriages samesex marriages and with special permission straight monogamous weddings  if mormonism is out of the mainstream it still does not rival in that way an obscure japanese religion called perfect liberty may goddess damn me if i am putting you on perfect liberty teaches salvation through playing golf as close to our own theory of salvation through nonsense as anyone else has come for that reason perfect liberty owns many of the regular golf courses that dot the us and japan  personally i think we discordians could work out a similar path to liberation via surfing that sounds like a program that would work for me unlike will rogers i cannot honestly say ive never met a man i didnt like but certainly i have never met a surfer i didnt like  when pope paul excommunicated saint christopher  who happens to be the patron saint of surfers  for what seems to us like the rather negligable fault of never existing the discordian society adopted him along with saint patrick discharged for the same reason at the same time  already an experienced beach bum with many years on the sands of floridas sun coast i think i might very well spend the twilight years of my life in the holy land of california mastering the graceful art of riding a surfboard when i am ready to take on disciples you can probably find me somewhere along the stretch between venice and san diego praying to eris for surf but joining me will entail sacrafices because a discordian surfer will be prohibited from owning anything but a surfboard trunks a toothbrush a beach towel and an automobile maybe a hot rod or dune buggy because surfing is not just a sport its a lifestyle and discordianism is not just a religion it is a mental illness  should you arrive too late during the first many years of my next lifetime i shall be found in the simon bolivar school for boys of the discordian convent of san medellin ciudad de sandoz columbia  where instead of beating pupils for misconduct the nuns give them blow jobs and then threaten delinquents with a termination of favors at least thats what discordian san juan batista keeper of the seven veils tells us  but enough of this vocational planning if the discordian society is to become the worlds next great cargo cult it will be due to the efforts of the house  of mirrors not only have we nunneries but recognized and accepted heresies powerful lobbies complete with popcorn concessopns and everything from progressive belaboring unions to square sewing circles many are mentioned in the  principia proper and i dont think it proper to repeatedly engage in repetitive repitition by repeating things repeated later on because i hate redundancy  but there are also some new ones such as the ignorant rescue mission with its rousing slogans rescue the ignorant save the dead cast out lepers members dress in old band or military brassbutton jackets and help attractive females get adequate sex  there are also the brunswick shriners moral regurgitation citizens against infant sexuality the crack house integration of the black lotus society the misplaced bolivian wild animal relocation fund the laurel foundation for the recognition of unique achievement the gould charitable trust for dynamic population control the patrio psychotic anarcho materialism study group and the sovereign state of confusion  also not mentioned in the principia  our many business ventures no church likes to engage in the unseemly practice of boasting of its great wealth but since i am being paid by the word i will list the names of our financial assets the brooklyn bridge holding company the umbrella corporation the spare change investment corporation junk mail assossiates san andreas shoreline properties the fast buck riding academy the informed sources news syndicate flybynight drug transport infinite vistas ltd everglades land investment cosa nostra amusements of new jersey and the laughing buddha jesus ranch of pinga grande texas inc  no doubt you are a little confused jesus god and the devil get such frequent billing in our religion  whereas most other faiths never advertise the competition thats mostly because of the neognostical influence of subgeniusism  jesus was not the son of god at all but  as he says again and again in the bible  he was the son of man actually his mission was to warn us against god  a laserarmed computerrobot space station sent to regulate or destroy humanity our very own dr van van mojo finally got rid of yhvh1 by sticking hat pins in a tetherball but thats another story  as for the devil  that is somebody our religion tried to do without for a long time we didnt think we needed a devil especially with eris discordias reputation being what it is already  but religions without devils are like politicians without enemies or perpetual motion machines if they are possible they might just work but who will ever know  our devil came through the back door after introducing himself as mr greyface you will read about him in the curse of greyface after blaming the first few evils on him we realised how handy he was and gave him a lifelong membership before we determined his true identity  what really fooled us is that his face is grey  and thats far from being his only resemblance to jr bob dobbs the subgenius messiah of mediocrity but then so many greyflanneled american males look like bob that is hardly evidence of conspiracy  one difference greyface never smiles except when he is showing you how stupid you are bob always smiles except when he is showing you how stupid you are for that reason the subgenii call greyface the antibob but in both our churches seers and sages know he is the devil  no matter whether he calls himself greyface or the antibob he acts like the devil because his most famous line is let me organize it for you  but no doubt you are also curious about eris where does she hang out these days  now that olympus has gone  tourist  eris discordia is in limbo where all we virtuous pagans and our gods and goddesses go between lifetimes think of key west in the off season and youve got it  imagine an openair bar at about ten in the morning an aging barefoot greek beauty with an art garfunkel hairdo is giving zeus the bartender a hard time with a barbed wit that always leaves him bereft of any retort besides an extended middle finger  another attraction of limbo is a nonstop party for the faithful but zeus has child support bills and eris never was much of a party animal contrary to popular belief  nor will you find any subgenii at that party or anywhere else in limbo with bikers and nazis  if they were good nazis  skinheads and pillars of the church of the subgenius go to vahallah  bad people of every persuasion go to the region of thud  a sprawling astral subdivisionwhere there is nothing to do but eat and watch television and where all the houses yards and people look pretty much alike thud keeps up with the jonses most christians are there but in their creed it is called paradise  only souls who in the eyes of eris went out of their way to be a pain in the ass during their earthly sojourns are in hell harry j aslinger qualifies but still the perils of hell are exaggerated fire and brimstone are sources of heating during cold snaps but our human rights group amnasty interfactional reports that nothing in hell is any worse than the hideous shade of pink on its walls  there are also such things as nirvana  an exclusive resort for extinguished zen masters  and the happy hunting grounds where traditional native american braves and warriors are the forest rangers dead cops and gurdjieffians who forgot to remember themselves go to the moon a big precinct station in the sky controlled by space aliens where there are twice as many laws as here  converted to its present use from what was originally a slain space monsters hollow titanium skill  you can onl be asking yourself at this point how these guys could possibly be taking all this shit seriously if we werent serious do you really think we would have published so many tracts and pamphlets at our own expense for so many years do people who are not serious stay awake nights thinking up new theologies and scriptures who but serious fanatics would have risked their lives by exposing their work to the readership of our first masscirculation publisher loompanics  let me answer by asking what being serious has to do with believing what we write but that isnt to say we dont at least believe in goddess  even if we are skeptical of what she says but that is now after more than three decades of discordianism no way did we think there was an eris discordia at first but as greg says at first i thought i was fucking around with eris now i see that eris is fucking around with me  a discordian must believe that eris discordia rules the material universe  and that she won it from god in a divorce suit during the beforelife and that the french anarchist pierre joseph proudhon was her attorney at the trial and that nobody is her prophet and that eating hotdog buns is a sin all else is a matter of individual conscience  graven images and icons and pictures of eris are all right as long as they are flattering safe sex  with a condom rubber gloves and a wet suit is fine as long as you dont fall in love you may covet your neighbors ass  providing your neighbor is into it you may drink but not to escape problems like the maltafarians of the subgenius church you may only  drink to create problems there is no prohibition against prayer  which is not to say we think it is a wise activity you dont have to believe in eristic avatars to be a discordian but it helps eristic avatars are sent down into  reality the original rorschach for the purpose keeping things from becoming so well ordered that they stop working this they often accomplish by insisting that certain arbitrary interpretations of reality are the only valid ones that causes strife which results in confusion which revitalizes holy chaos most eristic avatars display certain signs by which they can be certified such as employment as civil servants so far the most successful eristic avatar has been confucius eristic avatars can also be ascertained by the fact that they are always ignorant of their mission and have no idea they are serving eris or for that matter that they are even promoting confusion  that is made possible by the law of eristic escalation of which you must innocent to serve as eristic avatar for an unknown reason it does not work as well for those of us who guilty of it  this law pertains to any arbitrary or coercive imposition of order it is imposition of order  escalation of  chaos  fendersons amendment adds that the tighter the order in question is maintained the longer the consequent chaos takes to escalate but the more it does when it does  armed with the law of eristic escalation and fendersons amendment any imbecile  not just a sociologist  can understand politics  so i will translate into the lingua franca of the western world an imposition of order creates a chaos deficit which compounds until it is paid off by enduring all the outstanding chaos  of course eris thinks all chaos is outstanding but we mortals find too much of a good thing a little overwhelm ing thus we cringe when we encounter an anerism  a pronouncement that is which is innocent of the law of eristic escalation  if you hear that outlawing prostitution will eradicate rape you are listening to an anerism  a manifestation of aneristic delusion if you read the sacred chao on pages 00049 and 00050  instead of skipping over it in the recommended way  you will comprehend the anamysticmetaphorics of aneristics  an anerism nearly always enters the world through the mouth of a politician  but it can come by way of any authority figure such as a minister or a teacher or a parent or a boss or ronald mcdonald  we need more laws with stiffer penalties to rid our community of drugs says an innocent pawn of eris to be sure these laws make smuggling and selling and buying drugs more risky that in turn drives up their prices  thus making them more profitable so more money and work goes into expanding the market for the contraband  in keeping with the law of eristic escalation  or as the taoist sage chuang tzu simply said the more laws there are the more crime there is  identification and elucidation of anerisms is a favorite pastime of politically conscious discordians  who note that the whole text of my epistle to the paranoids on page 00069 is a psychological anerism goddess punished me for it about five years later by turning me into a paranoid myself a conspiracy helped her as of this writing i am still paranoid  according to my friends or are they my enemies  proliferation of crime in the wake of multiplication of laws is more than a matter of expanded definition governments are impositions of order designed to discourage theft and killing but they wind up taking more in taxes than all the freelance crooks around could steal their wars involve more killing than all the meanest toughs and hood lums can hope to rival  laws were unknown to the true people of old says chuang tzu all during the paleolithic and the neolithic there could hardly have been any laws because the cave paintings in france and spain depict no battle scenes  we know that in the time of moses many laws did not seem necessary or desirable because the second time he came down from mount sinai he said the good news is i got him down to ten the bad news is that one of them is still thou shalt not commit adultery  in limbo there are only five laws 1 no making anybody do anything they dont want except mind there own business 2 no shitting or pissing in the streets 3 no spitting on the floors 4 no undated notices on the bulletin board 5 no eating of hotdog buns that sounds like a program that will work for me because there is nothing in there against swiping jokes  nearly all the graphics in principia discordia by the way were ripped off i dont know why because greg and i are both passible artists the discordian society does not condone plagiarism our rates for illos are quite reasonable discordians hold all unoriginality in contempt our familiarity with discordian themes is unsurpassable henceforth no discordian shall rip off graphics contact me or greg for your eristic artistic needs  all i can say in our defense is at least we were honest about it as we reached the end of the third edition greg pasted in a little blurb that credited the graphics to ripoff press  which he snipped out of something that was actually printed by ripoff press hows that for a rip off  you will also notice an unusual number of unusual rubber stampings scattered about among the following pages that was greg showing off his rubber stamp collection few hobbies are as psychologically gratifying  especially when some bureaucrat is making you wait with his or her back to you for a moment  as collection rubber stamps this is also an exciting way to recoup some of your tax losses but you must abide by the laws of the rubber stamp congress all discordians are permitted to collect rubber stamps provided they dont mention the discordian society if they are caught just point out to them that among people of all faiths stamp collecting is a popular hobby and tell them your religious preference is none of their business tell them that collecting stamps in the name of your nameless religion is your constitutional right and then to make your point take the fifth amendment they will find themselves in a legalistic quandary  on most occasions mentioning your discordian society affiliation is perfectly acceptable if perchance you are idiotic enough to somehow foolishly blunder and end up in the military insist they stamp discordian on your dog tags because we are sick and tired of hearing there are no discordians in foxholes  you might also wish to list discordian as your religion on job applications  especially if you are already on unemployment and dont want the damned jobs anyhow  a secret method of identifying your discordianship for the benefit of other discordians is by wearing a pulloff aluminum beercan tab strung through its ring around your neck that is called an allseeing eye of eris complete with tear and it will help other members of the discordian society keep out of your way  or if you are an extrovert  and are not even ashamed of it  you can get up on a soap box and rant for goddess right out in public personally i prefer standing on a wooden box but anyway you get at least five points for every rant you deliver extra points are awarded for handling hecklers with aplomb  or with anything else besides your fists  a secret of dealing with hecklers incidentally was imparted to me by a professional rabble rouser who used to speak in hyde park you memorize a bunch of standardized putdowns good for all occasions so no matter what your tormentor says you can fire back with something like hot air makes a balloon go up whats holding you down  another secret of ranting was revealed by rev ivan stang when of a rejected submission to the stark fist he said it wandered but not enough a fine rant doesnt just wander it positively meanders use this introduction as a model keep changing the subject so your listeners with their short attention spans wont get bored if you change themes between 45 and 72 times a minute a rhythm close to the human heartbeat  and mystify them by mixing meta phors  pretty soon those suckers will be putty in the palm of your hand at your feet wrapped around your little finger  you can also learn a great deal by studying magnificent orators of the past huey p long taxed standard oil ten dollars for each barrel they pumped in louisiana and then gave them back 90 of it under the table aaron burr shot alexander hamilton  mark anthony kept saying but these are honorable men all through his speech remember how effective that selective repitition was in swaying the emotions of the actors in shakepeares play who were cast as roman citizens  do not for a moment think you cannot be an exceptional orator if you can just find some way to keep repeating yourself hypnotically and changing the subject of your speech frequently at the same time  winston churchill pointed out another attribute of good rhetoric it is sincere you must yourself realy be against the germans buzzbombing london before you can persuade the english people it is a rotten notion  natural aptitude also plays its part america has known no greater public speaker than franklin d roosevelt whose son once quipped father wanted to be the bride at every wedding and the corpse at every funeral and thats important to keep in mind because if you want to be the bride at every funeral and the corpse at every wedding you just are not made of the right ingredients your timing is off  in that case you could have better luck with eyeballtoeyeball conversations the versatile art of oneonone seduction which you want to learn anyway here too hypnotic repitition is a key to unlimited potential pick any theme out of the air for repeating  a word a name or a number will do let us say for this example that you choose the number five into your pitch again and again five times five over and over drive that mother home until your victim is entranced in the fifth dimension then dazzle them with all the techniques in a primer for erisian evangelists on page 00065  such mood setters as lighting and music are also important for maximum results illuminate the room with strobe lights play beethovens fifth symphony in the background they will be putty eating out of your hand  if you are repelled by having anything to do with human beings whatsoever  as individuals or in groups  then you were probably meant to be a great discordian writer such as myself  that being the case my advice to you is consider that rousing literary form known as the manifesto not only should you read the communist manifesto so you can find our how to get bankers to finance your activities you should also study the lesserknown but equally great specimens of this genre what especially comes to mind in this respect is that underground classic anonymous authorship manifesto of the artistic elite of the midwest  as it has not yet been anthologized i reproduce it here in full just as it appeared in issue 2 of false positive c o donna kossy box 953 allston ma 02134  manifesto of the artistic elite of the midwest artistic elite is a misnomer we claim unity with the american  midwest where we were born and raised we support the secession of the midwest from the faltering carcass of the american way we feel that the midwest should sign its own treaties and create its own alliances we support liberation for quebec we dont believe in the balance of terror hypothesis and wish to be counted out of all future nuclear war we believe in the sanity and stability of the midwest and refute those of either coast who see the heartland as oppressive backward uncultured we are redneck motherfucker etc this is propoganda created by the intellectual power elite of the east in their cynical and ruthless attempt  to keep the chains on middle america we claim solidarity with the third world as an exploited people as one of the richest third world nations we vow to beat our winebagos in plowshares in order to do our part in the growing third world alliance we call for the cessation of the telecommunications monopoly and destruction of all over the air methods of propagandizing no more lucy no more beaver no more corporate propagandizing for the consumerist ethic free tv a new localized media system will be created no more sensationalist news coverage constant and open exchange of ideas and a refutation of present masssubscribed theories of the free exchange ideas no more enslavement to the marlboro cowboy no more enslavement to the false illusion of american individuality real individuality not hype no more charlies angels no more escapism this  is a call for the midwest peoples to be concerned with their own lives not the lives the west thinks we have and the east demands we have this is a call for solidarity of all midwestern peoples so that we can refute the ideas of the east to call a halt to the convenient image of the midwest as a passive land filled with bumpkins and hayseeds of easily led puppets of a land easily dominated by the ideas and wills of our english speaking cousins were not your puppets anymore we need to restructure our eastern dominated universities solidarity with the canadian midlands solidarity with the ukraine an end to the industrial monopoly of the worlds resources an end to the blight of consumerism an end to the present sectioning of the world and unity with all oppressed peoples  sponsored by the organization of indiana artistic elites  note the presence here in spite of a lack of explicit discordianism of all the characteristics of an excellent manifesto mixed emotions expressed with all the vitrolic vehemence of unmixed emotions  so if there is a cause about which you are ambivalent do like karl marx did pen its manifesto no discordian manifesto yet exists we need at least five that will generate controversy and confuse greyface my own favorite holy name  omar khayyam ravenhurst  functions in that way it is a walking identity crisis  anybody can say or do anything in the name of omar khayyam ravenhurst for better or worse that never fails to confuse the authorities  this tradition started in 1960 when i was basic training clerk in marine air base 11 i typed in the ravenhurst moniker on a training lecture roster listing him as a truck driver in motor transport  serial number 1369697 rank private  when ravenhurst omat k failed to answer the role call somebody called the captain in charge of motor transport to find out where ravenhurst was of course nobody in the motor pool ever heard of any such private  motor transport called administration no ravenhurst on record there either a clerktypist from administration corporal chadwick came by to ask me about the mysterious marine  upon returning to his desk chadwick completed an irc card  a condensed record  which would have to do until ravenhursts entire file arrived from his last duty station marine barracks east british outer cambodia  an unusual man this ravenhurst  with his iq of 157 how many other truck drivers spoke 17 languages but in ten years of service had never been recommended for promotion  you would imagine that one glance at such statistics would arouse suspiscion but some days later there occured within my earshot a conversation between two lieutenants and the swaggering staff sergeant who headed basic training who so as to protect his identity from ridicule i shall call karen elliot instead of sergeant garcia  where do you figure he learned 17 languages  including upper and lower swahili one of the officers wondered aloud  ill bet his parents were missionaries contributed karen elliot  most men make private first class in about six months this guy has been a private for ten years im going to recommend him for promotion announced the other lieutenant  you better have a talk with him first sir karen elliot warned you just never can tell about them intellegent  guys  chadwick who was lurking nearby suddenly shouted there he is thats him thats ravenhurst right there  a big chunky truck driver whose nickname was buddha happened to be dampening the dust in that vicinity with a watertank equipped with a sprinkler in back  eager to score some points with the officers karen elliot ran over and yelled at the buddha buddha stopped the truck and shut off the engine and then said what you wont grow any grass that way elliot repeated with a weak laugh oh spake the buddha before starting up the truck again and driving off  stories like that spread rapidly and so did the ravenhurst name on his behalf i for my part answered a survey on improving basic training more realistic combat conditions on the obstacle course and field training in venereal disease control where among his recommendations  later on i added to our files an application by ravenhurst for officer training school reason i have been a private for ten years so the only way i expect to be promoted is if i try for second lieutenant across the page was stamped approved nevertheless for some unexplained reason ravenhurst remained a private  after i was discharged i ran into bud simco who remained in the same unit a short while longer than me about a month after you mustered out there was a dress rehearsal for the biggest inspection of the year  by then ravenhurst had a wall locker with his name on it and a bunk somebody even added a touch of realism by putting an old pair of size six shoes with holes in them under ravenhursts bunk  there was only one other guy in that cubicle and he was pretty bent out of shape because ravenhurst was never there in the mornings to help sweep once or twice he even brought it up with the top sergeant  when the big day came they even shut down radar center everybody had to stand inspection no exceptions colonel fenderson and the top sergeant walked down the isle inspecting one cubicle at a time it was junk on  the bunk he added indicating the most thorough inspection there is  with every piece of gear spread out neatly on the bunk only one bunk with bedding on it was empty only one man was missing  they wanted to know who ravenhurst was and more importantly where he was nobody knows but the other guy in his cubicle reminds the top sergeant than ravenhurst is a malingerer  then they ask if anybody has ever seen this ravenhurst private monty cantsin pipes up every afternoon ravenhurst sits right there on his bunk  well then what does this ravenhurst look like cantsin stretches out both arms and says oh hes a big mountain of a man but just then the top sergeant bends over and picks up these little size six shoes  they call up motor transport for the hundredth goddamned time the captain tells the top sergeant there is nobody named ravenhurst in motor transport so the brass huddle together and decide ravenhurst must have mustered into squadron without checking in with his assigned work station  so he could just fuck off all the time so they are ready to hang him  as soon as they find him  a futile basewide manhunt was conducted before sergeant karen elliot heard they were searching for ravenhurst somehow  perhaps by examining the basic training files  he discovered that ravenhurst was a hoax earlier and now he spilled the beans in exchange im sure for many points  a few days later a letter of commendation dictated by colonel fenderson appeared on the squadron bulletin board  congradulating private omar khayyam ravenhurst for outstanding conduct  in 1968 when robert anton wilson and i decided to form a conspiracy with no purpose  so that investigators would never be able to figure out what it was doing  i told him about ravenhurst and invited him or anyone else he recruited to do anything anywhere any time under the already ubiquitous name we decided to call that conspiracy however unoriginally the bavarian illuminati  a caper that culminated eventually in the illuminatus trilogy  as for ravenhurst the last i heard was the kgb was trying to find him so they could make him chairman of the american communist party  im sure they got the wrong fenderson  omar khayyam ravenhurst pvt usmc ret january 23 1991
