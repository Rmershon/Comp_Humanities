paradoxes of defence wherein is proved the true grounds of fight to be the short ancient weapons and that the short sword has advantage over the long sword or the long rapier and the weakness and imperfection of the rapierfights displayed together with an admonition to the noble ancient victorious valiant and most brave nation of englishmen to beware of false teachers of defence and how they forsake their own natural fights with a brief commendation of the noble science or exercising of arms by george silver gentleman london printed for edward blount 1599  to the right honorable my singular good lord robert earl of essex and ewe earl marshall of england viscount hereford lord ferrers of chartley bourchier and louaine master of the queens majestys horse  of the ordinance chancellor of the university of cambridge knight of the most noble order of the garter and one of her highness most honorable privy council  fencing right honorable in this new fangled age is like our fashions every day a change resembling the chameleon who alters himself into all colors save white so fencing changes into all wards save the right that it is so experience teaches us why it is so i doubt not but your wisdom does conceive there is nothing permanent that is not true what can be true that is uncertain how can that be certain that stands upon uncertain grounds the mind of man a greedy hunter after truth finding the seeming truth but changing not always one but always diverse forsakes the supposed to find out the assured certainty and searching everywhere save where it should meets with all save what it would who seeks  finds not seeks in vain who seeks in vain must if he will find seek again yet all in vain who seeks not what he would as he should and where he should as in other things right honorable so in fencing the mind desirous of truth hunts after it and hating falsehood flies from it and therefore having missed it once it assays the second time if then he thrives not he tries another way when he has failed he adventures on the third  if all these fail him yet he never fails to change his weapon his fight his ward if by any means he may compass what he most affects for because men desire to find out a true defence for themselves in their fight therefore they seek it diligently nature having taught us to defend ourselves and art teaching us how and because we miss it in one way we change to another but though we often chop and change turn and return from ward to ward from fight to fight in this constant search yet we never rest in any and that because we never find the truth and therefore we never find it because we never seek it in that weapon where it may be found for to seek for a true defence in an untrue weapon is to angle on the earth for fish and to hunt in the sea for hares truth is ancient though it seems an upstart our forefathers were wise though our age accounts them foolish valiant though we repute them cowards they found out the true defences for their bodies in short weapons by their wisdom they defended themselves and subdued their enemies and those weapons with their valor1 and right honorable if we have this true defence we must seek it where is is in short swords short staves the half pike partisans glaives or such like weapons of perfect lengths not in long swords long rapiers nor frog pricking poniards for if there is no certain grounds for defence why do they teach it if there be why have they not found it not because it is not so to say so were to gainsay the truth but because it is not certain in those weapons which they teach to prove this i have set forth these my paradoxes different i confess from the main current of our outlandish teachers but agreeing i am well assured to the truth and tending as i hope to the honor of our english nation the reason which moved me to adventure so great a task is the desire i have to bring the truth to light which has a long time lain hidden in the cave of contempt while we like degenerate sons have forsaken our forefathers virtues with their weapons and have lusted like men sick of a strange ague after the strange vices and devices of italian french and spanish fencers little remembering that these apish toys could not free rome from brenniuss sack not france from the king henry the fifth his conquest to this desire to find out truth the daughter of time begotten of bellona i was also moved that by it i might remove the great loss of our english gallants which we daily suffer by these imperfect fights wherein none undertake the combat be his cause never so good his cunning never so much his strength and agility never so great but his virtue was tied to fortune happy man happy dolt kill or be killed is the dreadful issue of the devilish imperfect fight if the man were now alive which beat the masters for the scholars fault because he had no better instructed him these italian fencers could not escape his censure who teach us offense not defence and to fight as diogenes scholars were taught to dance to bring their lives to an end by art was ajax a coward because he fought with a seven folded buckler or are we mad to go naked into the field to try our fortunes not our virtues was achilles a runaway who wore that well tempered armor or are we desperate who care for nothing but to fight and learn like the the pygmies with bodkins or weapons of like defence is it valorous for a man to go naked against his enemy why then did the lacedemonians punish him as desperate whom they rewarded for his valor with a laurel crown but that which is most shameful they teach men to butcher one another here at home in peace wherewith they cannot hurt their enemies abroad in war2 for you honor well knows that when the battle is joined there is no room for them to draw their birdspits and when they have them what can they do with them can they pierce his corslet with the point can they unlace his helmet unbuckle his armor hew asunder their pikes with a stocata a reversa a dritta a stramason or other such tempestuous terms no these toys are fit for children not for men for straggling boys of the camp to murder poultry not for men of honor to try the battle with their foes thus i have right honorable for the trial of the truth between the short sword and the long rapier for the saving of the lives of our english gallants who are sent to certain death by their uncertain fights  for abandoning of that mischievous and imperfect weapon which serves to kill our friends in peace but cannot much hurt our foes in war have i at this time given forth these paradoxes to the view of the world and because i know such strange opinions had need of stout defence i humbly crave your honorable protection as one in whom the true nobility of our victorious ancestors has taken up residence it will suit to the rest of your honors most noble complements to maintain the defence of their weapons whose virtues you profess it agrees with your honorable disposition to receive with favor what is presented with love it sorts well with your lordships high authority to weigh with reason what is fit for marshal men it is an unusual point of your honor which wins your lordship love in your country to defend the truth in whomsoever and it adds a supply to that which your lordship have of late begun to your unspeakable honor and inestimable benefit to reduce the wearing of swords with hilts over the hands3 to the roman discipline no longer then they might draw them under their arms or over their shoulders in all or any of these respects i rest assured that your lordship will vouchsafe to receive with favor and maintain with honor these paradoxes of mine which if they be shrouded under so safe a shield i will not doubt but to maintain with reason among the wise and prove it by practice upon the ignorant that there is no certain defence in the rapier and that there is great advantage in the short sword against the long rapier or all manner of rapiers in general of what length soever and that the short staff has the advantage against the long staff of twelve fourteen sixteen or eighteen feet long or of what length soever and against two men with their swords and daggers or two rapiers poniards  gauntlets or each of them a case of rapiers which whether i can perform or not i submit for trial to your honors martial censure being at all times ready to make it good in what manner and against what man soever it shall stand upon your lordships good liking to appoint and so i humbly commend this book to your lordships wisdom to peruse and your honor to the highest to protect in all health and happiness now and ever your honors in all duty  george silver  an admonition to the noble ancient victorious valiant and most brave nation of englishmen 1  george silver having the perfect knowledge of all manner of weapons and being experienced in all manner of fights thereby perceiving the great abuses of the italian teachers of offense done unto them and great errors inconveniences  false resolutions they have brought them into has informed me even for pity of their most lamentable wounds and slaughters  as i verily think it my bound duty with all love and humility to admonish them to take heed how they submit themselves into the hand of italian teachers of defence or strangers whatsoever and to beware how they forsake or suspect their own natural fight that they may by casting off these italianated weak fantastical and most devilish and imperfect fights and by exercising their own ancient weapons be restored or achieve unto the natural and most manly and victorious fight again the dint and force whereof many brave nations have both felt and feared our plowmen have mightily prevailed against them as also against masters of defence both in schools and countries that have taken upon them to stand upon school tricks and juggling gambols whereby it grew to a common speech among the countrymen bring me to a fencer i will bring him out of his fence tricks with down right blows i will make him forget his fence tricks i will warrant him i speak not against masters of defence indeed they are to be honored nor against the science it is noble and in my opinion to be preferred next to divinity for as divinity preserves the soul from hell and the devil so does this noble science defend the body from wounds  slaughter and moreover the exercising of weapons puts away aches griefs and diseases it increases strength and sharpens the wits it gives a perfect judgement it expels melancholy choleric and evil conceits it keeps a man in breath perfect health and long life it is unto him that has the perfection thereof a most friendly and comfortable companion when he is alone having but only his weapon about him it puts him out of fear  in the wars and places of most danger it makes him bold hardy and valiant  and for as much as this noble and most mighty nation of englishmen of their good natures are always most loving very credulous  ready to cherish  protect strangers yet that through their good natures they never more by strangers or false teachers may be deceived once again i most humbly to admonish them or such as shall find in themselves a disposition or desire to learn their weapons of them that from henceforth as strangers shall take upon them to come hither to teach this noble  most valiant  victorious nation to fight that first before they learn of them they cause a sufficient trial to be very requisite  reasonable even such as i myself would be contented withal if i should take upon me to go in their country to teach their nation to fight and this is the trial they shall play with such weapons as they profess to teach withal4 three bouts apiece with three of the best english masters of defence  three bouts apiece with three unskillful valiant men and three bouts apiece with three resolute men half drunk then if they can defend themselves against these masters of defence and hurt and go free from the rest then are they be honored cherished and allowed for perfect good teachers and what countrymen soever they be but if any of these they take fail then they are imperfect in their profession their fight is false  they are false teachers deceivers and murderers and to be punished accordingly yet no worse punishment unto them i wish than such as in their trial they shall find  there are four special marks to know the italian fight is imperfect  that the italian teachers and setters forth of books of defence never had the perfection of the true fight 2  the first mark is they seldom fight in their own country unarmed commonly in this sort a pair of gauntlets upon their hands5 and a good shirt of mail upon their bodies the second mark is that neither the italian nor any of their best scholars do never fight but they are most commonly sore hurt or one or both of them slain  the third mark is they never teach their scholars nor set down in their books any perfect length of their weapons without which no man can by nature or art against the perfect length fight safe for being too short their times are too long and spaces too wide for their defence and being too long they will be upon every cross that shall happen to be made whether it shall be done by skill or chance in great danger of death because the rapier being too long the cross cannot be undone in due time but may be done by going back with the feet but that time is always too long to answer the time of the hand therefore every man ought to have a weapon according to his own stature the tall man must have his sword longer than the man of mean stature else he has wrong in his defence  the man of mean stature must have his weapon longer than the man of small stature else he has wrong in his defence  the man of small stature must beware he does not feed himself with this vain conceit that he will have his weapon long to reach as far as the tall man for therein he shall have great disadvantage both with the making of a strong cross and also in uncrossing again and in keeping his point from crossing and when a cross is made upon him to defend himself or in danger his enemy or to redeem his lost times again rapiers longer than is convenient to accord with the true statures of men are always too long or too heavy to keep their bodies in due time from the cross of the light short sword of perfect length the which being made by the skillful out of any of the four true times upon any of the four chief actions by reason of the uncertainty  great swiftness in any of these times they are in great danger of a blow or of a thrust in the hand arm head or face  in every true cross in the uncrossing in great danger of a blow upon the head or full thrust in the body or face and being taken in that time  place the first mover in uncrossing speeds the rapier man of imperfect length whether it is too long too short or too heavy and goes free himself by the direction of his governors  the fourth mark is the crosses of their rapiers for true defence of their hands are imperfect for the true carriage of the guardant fight without which all fights are imperfect  of six chief causes that many valiant men think themselves by their practices to be skillful in their weapons are yet many times in their fights sore hurt and many times slain by men of small skill or none at all 3  the first and chief cause is the lack of the four governors without which it is impossible to fight safe although a man should practice most painfully and most diligently all the days of his life  the second cause is the lack of the knowledge in due observance of the four actions the which we shall call bent spent lying spent and drawing back these actions every man fights upon whether they are skillful or unskillful he that observes them is safe he that observes them not is in continual danger of every thrust that shall be strongly made against him  the third cause is they are unpracticed in the four true times neither do they know the true times from the false therefore the true choice of their times are most commonly taken by chance and seldom otherwise  the fourth cause is they are unacquainted out of what fight or in what manner they are to answer the variable fight and therefore because the variable fight is the most easy fight of all others most commonly do answer the variable fight with the variable fight which ought never be but in the first distance or with the short sword against the long because if both or one of them shall happen to press and that in due time of either sides fight be changed the distance by reason of the narrowness of space is broken the place is won and lost of both sides then he that thrusts first speedeth if both happen to thrust together they are both in danger therefore things sometimes by true times by change of fights by chance are avoided  the fifth cause is their weapons are most commonly too long to uncross without going back with the feet  the sixth cause is their weapons are most commonly too heavy both to defend and offend in due time  by these two last causes many valiant men have lost their lives  what is the cause that wisemen in learning or practicing their weapons are deceived with italian fencers there are four causes the first their schoolmaster are imperfect the second is that whatsoever they teach is both true  false true in their demonstrations according with their force  time in gentle play6  in their actions according with the force  time in rough play or fight false for example there is much difference between these two kinds of fight as there is between the picture of sir beuis of southhampton and sir beuis himself if he were living the third none can judge of the craft but the craftsman the unskilled be he never so wise can not truly judge of his teacher or skill the which he learns being unskilled himself lastly  to confirm for truth all that shall be amiss not only in this excellent science of defence but in all other excellent secrets most commonly the lie bears as good a show of truth as truth itself  of the false resolutions and vain opinions of rapier men and of the danger of death thereby ensuing 4  it is a great question  especially among the rapier men who has the advantage the thruster or the warder some hold strongly that the warder has the advantage others say it is most certain that the thruster has the advantage now when two do happen to fight being both of one mind that the thruster has the advantage they make all shift they can who shall give the first thrust as for example two captains at southhampton even as they were going to take shipping upon the key fell at strife drew their rapiers and presently being desperate hardy or resolute as they call it with all force and over great speed ran with their rapiers one at the other  were both slain now when two of the contrary opinion shall meet and fight you shall see very peaceable wars between them for they verily think that he that first thrusts is in great danger of his life therefore with all speed do they put themselves in ward or stocata the surest guard of all other as vincentio says and thereupon they stand sure saying the one to the other thrust if you dare and says the other thrust if you dare or strike or thrust if you dare says the other then says the otherstrike or thrust if you dare for your life these two cunning gentlemen standing long time together upon this worthy ward they both depart in peace according to the old proverb it is good sleeping in a whole skin again if two shall fight the one of opinion that the warder has the advantage then most commonly the thruster being valiant with all speed thrusts home and by reason of the time and swift motion of his hand they are most commonly with the points of their rapiers or daggers or both one or both of them hurt or slain because their spaces of defence in this kind of fight are too wide in due time to defend and the place being won the eye of the patient by the swift motion of the agents hand is deceived another resolution they stand sure upon for their lives to kill their enemies in the which they are most commonly slain themselves that is this when they find the point of their enemys rapier out of the right line they say they may boldly make home a thrust with a passata the which they observe and do accordingly but the other having a shorter time with his hand as nature many times teaches him suddenly turns his wrist whereby he meets the other in his passage just with the point of his rapier in the face or body and this false resolution has cost many a life  that the cause that many are so often slain and many sore hurt in fight with long rapier is not by reason of their dangerous thrusts nor cunning of that italianated fight but in the length and unwieldiness thereof 5  it is most certain that men may with short swords both strike thrust false and double by reason of their distance and nimbleness thereof more dangerously than they can with long rapiers and yet when two fight with short swords having true fight there is no hurt done neither is it possible in any reason that any hurt should be done between them of either side and this is well known to all such as have the perfection of the true fight by this it plainly appears that the cause of the great slaughter and sundry hurts done by long rapiers consists not in their long reach dangerous thrusts nor cunningness of the italian fight but in the inconvenient length and unwieldiness of their long rapiers whereby it commonly falls out that in all their actions appertaining to their defence they are unable in due time to perform and continually in danger of every cross that shall happen to be made with their rapier blades which being done within the half rapier unless both are of one mind with all speed to depart which seldom or never happens between men of valiant disposition it is impossible to uncross or get out or avoid the stabs of the daggers and this has fallen out many times among valiant men at those weapons  of running and standing safe in rapier fight the runner has the advantage 6  if two valiant men fight being both cunning in running  that they both use the same at one instant their course is doubled the place is won of both sides and one or both of them will commonly be slain or sore hurt and if one of them shall run and the other stand fast upon the imbrocata or stocata or however the place will be at one instant won of one side and gained of the other and one or both of them will be hurt or slain if both shall press hard upon the guard he that first thrusts home in true place hurts the other  if both thrust together they are both hurt yet some advantage the runner has because he is an uncertain mark and in his motion the other is a certain mark and in dead motion and by reason of this many times the unskillful man takes advantage he knows not how against him that lies watching upon his ward or stocata guard  of striking and thrusting both together 7  it is strongly held by many that if in a fight they find their enemy to have more skill than themselves they presently will continually strike  thrust just with him whereby they will make their fight as good as his and thereby have as good advantage as the other with all his skill but if their swords be longer than the other then their advantage is great for it is certain say they that an inch will kill a man but if their swords be much longer than the other then their advantage is so great that they will be sure by striking and thrusting just with the other that they will always hurt him that has the short sword and go clear themselves because they will reach him when he shall not reach them these men speak like such as talk of robin hood that never shot with his bow for to strike or thrust just together with a man of skill lies not in the will of the ignorant because a skillful man always fights upon the true times by which the unskillful is still disappointed of both place and time and therefore driven of necessity still to watch the other when  what he will do that is whether he will strike thrust or false if the unskillful strike or thrust in the time of falsing therein he neither strikes or thrusts just with the other he may say he has struck or thrust before him but not just with him not to any good purpose for in the time of falsing if he strikes or thrusts he strikes or thrusts too short for in that time he has neither time nor place to strike home and as it is said the unskillful man that will take upon him to strike or thrust just with the skillful must first behold what the man of skill will do and when he will do it and therefore of necessity is driven to suffer the skillful man to be the first mover and entered into his action whether it is blow or thrust the truth of this cannot be denied now judge whether it is possible for an unskillful man to strike or thrust just together with a man of skill but the skillful man can most certainly strike and thrust just with the unskillful because the unskillful fights upon false times which being too long to answer the true times the skillful fighting upon the true times although the unskillful is the first mover  entered into his action whether it is blow or thrust yet the shortness of the true times make at the pleasure of the skillful a just meeting together in the perfect fight two never strike or thrust together because they never suffer place nor time to perform it  two unskillful men many times by chance strike or thrust together chance unto them because they know not what they do or how it comes to pass but the reasons or causes are these sometimes two false times meet  make a just time together  sometimes a true time and a false time meet and make a just time together and sometimes two true times meet and make a just time together and all this happens because the true time and place is unknown unto them  george silver his resolution upon that hidden or doubtful question who has the advantage of the offender or defender 8  the advantage is strongly held by many to be in the offender yea insomuch that if two minding to offend in their fight it is thought to be in him that first strikes or thrusts others strongly hold opinion that the warder absolutely has still the advantage but these opinions as they are contrary the one to the other so are they contrary to true fight as may well be seen by these short examples if the advantage be in the warder than it is not good any time to strike or thrust if the advantage is in the striker or thruster then were it a frivolous thing to learn to ward or at any time to seek to ward since in warding lies disadvantage now may it plainly by these examples appear that if there is any perfection in fight that both sides are deceived of their opinions because if the striker or thruster has the advantage then is the warder still in danger of wounds or death if again if the warder has the advantage then is the striker or thrust in as great danger to defend himself against the warder because the warder from his wards takes advantage of the striker or thruster upon every blow or thrust that shall be made against him then thus do i conclude that if there is perfection in the science of defence they are all in their opinions deceived and that the truth may appear for the satisfaction of all men this is my resolution that there is no advantage absolutely nor disadvantage in striker thruster or warder and their is great advantage in the striker thruster  warder but in this manner in the perfection of fight the advantage consists in fight between party and party that is whosoever wins or gains the place in true pace space and time has the advantage whether he is striker thruster or warder and that is my resolution  of spanish fight with the rapier 9  the spaniard is now thought to be a better man with his rapier than is the italian frenchman high almaine german  st or any other country man whatsoever because they in their rapierfight stand upon so many intricate tricks that in all the course of a mans life it shall be hard to learn them and if they miss in doing the least of them in their fight they are in danger of death but the spaniard in his fight both safely to defend himself and to endanger his enemy has but one lying and two wards to learn wherein a man with small practice in a very short time may become perfect  this is the manner of the spanish fight they stand as brave as they can with their bodies straight upright narrow spaced with their feet continually moving as if they were in a dance holding forth their arms and rapiers very straight against the face or bodies of their enemies and this is the only lying to accomplish that kind of fight and this note that as long as any man shall lie in that manner with his arm and the point of his rapier straight it shall be impossible for his adversary to hurt him because in that straight holding forth of his arm which way soever a blow shall be made against him by reason that his rapier hilt lies so far before him he has but a very little way to move to make his ward perfect in this manner if a blow is made at the right side of the head a very little moving of the hand with the knuckles upward defends that side of the head or body and the point being still out straight greatly endangers the striker and so likewise if a blow is made at the left side of the head a very small turning of the wrist with the knuckles downward defends that side of the head and body and the point of rapier much endangers the hand arm face or body of the striker and if any thrust is made the wards by reason of the indirections in moving the feet in manner of dancing as aforesaid makes a perfect ward and still withal the point greatly endangers the other and thus is the spanish fight perfect so long as you can keep that order and soon learned and therefore to be accounted the best fight with the rapier of all other but note how the spanish fight is perfect and you shall see no longer than you can keep your point straight against your adversary as for example i have heard the like jest  there was a cunning doctor at his first going to sea being doubtful that he should be sea sick an old woman perceiving the same said unto him sir i pray be of good comfort i will teach you a trick to avoid that doubt here is a fine pebble stone if you please to accept it take it with you and when you are on ship board put it in your mouth and as long you shall keep the same in your mouth upon my credit you shall never vomit the doctor believed her and took it thankfully at her hands and when he was at sea he began to be sick whereupon he presently put the stone in his mouth  there kept it so long as he possibly could but through his extreme sickness the stone with vomit was cast out of his mouth then presently he remembered how the woman had mocked him and yet her words were true  even so a spaniard having his rapier point put by may receive a blow on the head or a cut over the face hand or arm or a thrust in the body or face and yet his spanish fight perfect so long as he can keep straight the point of his rapier against the face or body of his adversary which is as easy in that manner of fight to be done as it was for the doctor in the extremity of his vomit to keep the stone in his mouth  yet one other pretty jest more scarce worth the reading in commendation of outlandish fight there was an italian teacher of defence in my time who so excellent in his fight that he would hit any english man with a thrust just upon any button in his doublet and this was much spoken of  also there was another cunning man in catching of wildgeese he would have made no more ado when he had heard them cry as the manner of wildgeese is flying one after another in rows but presently looking up would tell them if there had been a dozen sixteen twenty or more he would have taken every one and this tale was many times told by men of good credit and much marvelled at by their hearers and the man who would have taken the wildgeese was of good credit himself merry they said indeed he did never take any but at any time when he looked up and seen them fly in that manner he would with all his heart have taken them but he could no more tell how to do it then could the cunning italian fencer tell how to hit an englishman with a thrust just upon any one of his buttons when he listed  illusions for the maintenance of imperfect weapons  false fights to fear or discourage the unskillful in their weapons from taking a true course or use for attaining to the perfect knowledge of true fight 10  first for the rapier says the italian or false teacher i hold to be a perfect good weapon because the cross hinders not to hold the handle in the hand to thrust both far  straight  to use all manner of advantages in the wards or suddenly to call the same at the adversary but with the sword you are driven with all the strength of the hand to hold fast the handle and in the wars i would wish no friend of mine to wear swords with hilts because when they are suddenly set upon for haste they set their hands upon their hilts instead of their handles in which time it happens many times before they can draw their swords they are slain by their enemies7 and for sword and buckler fight it is imperfect because the buckler blinds the fight neither would i have any man lie aloft with his hand above his head to strike sound blows strong blows are naught especially being set above the head because therein all the face and body are discovered yet i confess in old times when blows were only used with short swords  bucklers  back swords these kinds of fights were good  most manly now a days fight is altered rapiers are longer for advantage than swords were wont to be when blows were used men were so simple in their fight that they thought him a coward that would make a thrust or a blow beneath the girdle8 again if their weapons were short as in times past they were yet fight is better looked into these days than then it was who is it in these days sees not that the blow compasses round like a wheel whereby it has a long way to go but the thrust passes in a straight line and therefore comes a nearer way and done in a shorter time than is the blow and is more deadly than is the blow there fore there is no wise man that will strike unless he is weary of his life it is certain that the point for advantage every way in fight is to be used the blow is utterly naught and not to be used he that fights upon the blow especially with a short sword will be sore hurt or slain the devil can say no more for the maintenance of errors  that a blow comes continually as near as a thrust and most commonly nearer stronger more swift and is sooner done 11  the blow by reason that it compasses round like a wheel whereby it has a longer way to come as the italian fencer says  that the thrust passing in a straight line comes a nearer way and therefore is sooner done than a blow is not true these are the proofs9  let two lie in their perfect strengths and readiness wherein the blades of their rapiers by the motion of the body may not be crossed of either side the one to strike and the other to thrust then measure the distance or course wherein the hand and hilt passes to finish the blow of the one and the thrust of the other and you shall find them both by measure in distance all one at let any man of judgement being seen in the exercise of weapons not being more addicted unto novelties of fight than unto truth itself put in measure and practice these three fights variable open and guardant and he shall see that whenever any man lies at the thrust at the variable fight where of necessity most commonly he lies or otherwise not possible to keep his rapier from crossing at the blow  thrust upon the open or guardant fight that the blows  thrusts from these two fighters come a nearer way and a more stronger and swifter course than does the thrust out of the variable fight and thus for a general rule wheresoever the thruster lies or out of what fight soever he fights with his rapier or rapier and dagger the blow in his course comes as near and nearer and more swift and stronger than does the thrust  perfect fight stands upon both blow and thrust therefore the thrust is not only to be used 12  that there is no fight perfect without both blow and thrust neither is there any certain rule to be set down for the use of the point only10 these are the reasons in fight there are many motions with the hand body and feet and in every motion the place of the hand is altered  because by the motions of the hand the altering of the places of the hand the changes of lyings wards and breaking of thrusts the hand will sometimes be in place to strike some times to thrust sometimes after a blow to thrust sometimes after a thrust to strike  sometimes in a place where you may strike and cannot thrust without loss of time and sometimes in place where you may thrust and cannot strike without loss of time and sometimes in a place where you can neither strike nor thrust unless you fight upon both blow and thrust nor able to defend yourself by ward or going back because your space will be too wide and your distance lost and sometimes when you have made a thrust a ward or breaking is taken in such sort with the dagger or blade of the sword that you can neither thrust again nor defend yourself unless you do strike which you may soundly do and go free and sometimes when you strike a ward will be taken in such sort that you cannot strike again nor defend yourself unless you thrust which you may safely do and go free so to conclude there is no perfection in the true fight without both blow and thrust nor certain rule to be set down for the point only  that the blow is more dangerous and deadly in fight than a thrust for proof thereof to be made according with art and englishman holds argument against an italian 13  italian which is more dangerous or deadly in fight of a blow or a thrust  englishman this question is not propounded according to art because there is no fight perfect without both blow and thrust  italian let it be so yet opinions are otherwise held that the thrust is only to be used because it comes a near way and is more dangerous and deadly for these reasons first the blow compasses round like a wheel but the thrust passes in a straight line therefore the blow by reason of this compass has a longer way to go than the thrust  is therefore longer in doing but the thrust passes in a straight line therefore has a shorter way to go than has the blow  is therefore done in a shorter time  is therefore much better than the blow  more dangerous and deadly because if a thrust does hit the face or body it endangers life and most commonly death ensues but if the blow hits the body it is not so dangerous  englishman let your opinions be what they will but that the thrust comes a nearer way  is sooner done that the blow is not true and for proof thereof read the twelfth paradox and now will i set down possible reasons that the blow is better than the thrust and more dangerous and deadly11 first the blow comes as near a way  most commonly nearer than does the thrust  is therefore done in a shorter time than is the thrust therefore in respect of time whereupon stands the perfection of fight the blow is much better than the thrust again the force of the thrust passes straight therefore any cross being indirectly made the force of a child may put it by but the force of the blow passes indirectly therefore must be directly warded in the countercheck of his force which cannot be done but by the convenient strength of a man  with true cross in true time or else will not safely defend him and is therefor much better  more dangerous than the thrust and again the thrust being made through the hand arm or leg or in many places of the body and face are not deadly neither are they maims or loss of limbs or life neither is he much hindered for the time in his fight as long as the blood is hot for example  i have known a gentleman hurt in rapier fight in nine or ten places through the body arms and legs and yet has continued in his fight  afterward has slain the other and come home and has been cured of all his wounds without maim  is yet living but the blow being strongly made takes sometimes clean away the hand from the arm has many times been seen12 again a full blow upon the head or face with a short sharp sword is most commonly death a full blow upon the neck shoulder arm or leg endangers life cuts off the veins muscles and sinews perishes the bones these wounds made by the blow in respect of perfect healing are the loss of limbs or maims incurable forever  and yet more for the blow a full blow upon the head face arm leg or legs is death or the party so wounded in the mercy of him that shall so wound him for what man shall be able long in fight to stand up either to revenge or defend himself having the veins muscles sinews of his hand arm or leg clean cut asunder or being dismembered by such wound upon the face or head but shall be enforced thereby and through the loss of blood the other a little dallying with him to yield himself or leave his life in his mercy13  and for plainer deciding this controversy between the blow and the thrust consider this short note the blow comes many ways the thrust does not so the blow comes a nearer way than the thrust most commonly and is therefore sooner done the blow requires the strength of a man to be warded but the thrust may be put by by the force of a child a blow upon the hand arm or leg is maim incurable but a thrust in the hand arm or leg is to be recovered the blow has many parts to wound and in every of them commands the life but the thrust has but a few as the body or face and not in every part of them either  of the difference between the true fight  the false wherein consists the principles being had with the direction of the four governors the whole perfection of fight with all manner of weapons 14  the true fights be these whatsoever is done with the hand before the foot or feet is true fight the false fights are these whatsoever is done with the foot or feet before the hand is false because the hand is swifter than the foot the foot or feet being the slower mover than the hand the hand in that manner of fight is tied to the time of the foot or feet and being tied thereto has lost his freedom and is made thereby as slow in his motions as the foot or feet and therefor that fight is false  of evil orders or customs in our english fence schools  of the old or ancient teaching of weapons  things very necessary to be continued for the avoiding of errors and reviving and continuance of our ancient weapons and most victorious fight again 15  there is in my opinion in our fence schools an evil order or custom in these days used the which if it might stand with the liking of our masters of defence i think it necessary to be left for as long as it is used it shall be hard to make a good scholar that is this at the single sword sword and dagger  sword and buckler they forbid the thrust  at the single rapier and rapier  dagger they forbid the blow either they are both together best or the thrust altogether best or the blow altogether best if the thrust is best why do we not use it at the single sword sword  dagger  sword  buckler if the blow is best why do we not use it at the single rapier rapier  poniard but knowing by the art of arms that no fight is perfect without both blow and thrust why do we not use and teach both blow and thrust but however this we daily see that when two met in fight whether they have skill or none unless such as have tied themselves to that boyish italian weak imperfect fight they both strike and thrust and how shall he then do that being much taught in school that never learned to strike nor how to defend a strong blow and how shall he then do that being brought up in a fencing school that never learned to thrust with the single sword sword and dagger and sword and buckler nor how at these weapons to break a thrust surely i think a down right fellow that never came in school using such skill as nature yielded out of his courage strength and agility with good downright blows and thrust among as shall best frame in his hands should put one of these imperfect scholars greatly to his shifts besides there are now in these days no grips closes wrestlings striking with the hilts daggers or bucklers used in fencing schools our plowmen will by nature will do these things with great strength  agility but the schoolmen is altogether unacquainted with these things he being fast tied to such schoolplay as he has learned has lost thereby the benefit of nature and the plowman is now by nature without art a far better man than he therefore in my opinion as long as we bar any manner of play in school we shall hardly make a good scholar there is no manner of teaching comparable to the old ancient teaching that is first their quarters then their wards blows thrusts and breaking of thrusts then their closes and grips striking with the hilts daggers bucklers wrestlings striking with the foot or knee in the cods and all these are safely defended in learning perfectly of the grips14 and this is the ancient teaching and without this teaching there shall never scholar be made able do his uttermost nor fight safe again their swords in schools are too long by almost half a foot to uncross without going back with the feet within distance or perfectly to strike or thrust within the half or quarter sword and in serving of the prince when men do meet together in public fight are utterly naught and unserviceable the best length for perfect teaching of the true fight to be used and continued in fence schools to accord with the true statures of all men are these the blade to be a yard and an inch for men of mean stature and for men of tall statures a yard and three or four inches and no more15 and i would have the rapier continued in schools always ready for such as shall think themselves cunning or shall have delight to play with that imperfect weapon provided always that the schoolmaster or usher play with him with his short sword plying him with all manner of fight according to the true art this being continued the truth shall flourish the lie shall be beaten down and all nations not having the true science shall come with all gladness to the valiant and most brave english masters of defence to learn the true fight for their defence  the grounds or principles of true fight with all manner of weapons 16  first judgement

and all double weapons have eight wards the single sword has two with the point up and two with the point down the staff and all manner of weapons to be used with two hands have the like  the sword and buckler and the sword and dagger are double weapons and have eight wards two with the point up and two with the point down and two for the legs with the point down the point to be carried for both sides of the legs with the knuckles downward and two wards with the dagger or buckler for the head the forest bill is a double weapon by reason of the head and therefore has eight wards four with the staff four with the head four of them to be used as with the staff and the other four with the head the one up the other down and the other sideways  the names and numbers of times appertaining unto fight both true and false 18  there are eight times whereof four are true and four are false the true times are these the time of the hand the time of the hand and body the time of the hand body and foot the time of the hand body and feet the false times are these the time of the foot the time of the foot and body the time of the foot body and hand the time of the feet body and hand  thus have i thought good to separate and make known the true times from the false with the true wards thereto belonging that thereby the rather in practicing of weapons a true course may be taken for the avoiding of errors and evil customs and speedy attaining of good habit or perfect being in the true use and knowledge of all manner of weapons  of the length of weapons and how every man may fit himself to the perfect length of his weapon according to his own stature with brief reasons wherefore they ought to be so 19  to know the perfect length of your sword you shall stand with your sword and dagger drawn as you see this picture keeping out straight your dagger arm drawing back your sword as far as conveniently you can not opening the elbow joint of your sword arm and look what you can draw within your dagger that is the just length of your sword to be made according to your own stature16  image of a sworddagger stance  as i have here made a figurative demonstration to know the perfect length of the sword as afore is said so have i in the page following for the plainer understanding of the reader set forth a form of standing to know the lengths of the short staff half pike forest bill partisan and gleve or such like weapons of advantage as shall also best fit the statures of all men  image of man with pike  the perfect length of your two handed sword is the blade to be the length of the blade of your single sword  to know the perfect length of your short staff or half pike forest bill partisan or glaive or such like weapons of vantage and perfect lengths you shall stand upright holding the staff upright close by your body with your left hand reaching with your right hand your staff as high as you can and then allow to that length a space to set both your hands when you come to fight wherein you may conveniently strike thrust and ward  that is the just length to be made according to your stature and this note that these lengths will commonly fall out to be eight or nine foot long and will fit although not just the statures of all men without any hindrance at all unto them in their fight because in any weapon wherein the hands may be removed and at liberty to make the weapon longer of shorter in fight at his pleasure a foot of the staff being behind the backmost hand does no harm and wherefore these weapons ought to be of the lengths aforesaid and no shorter these are the reasons if they should be shorter then the long staff morris pike and such like weapons over and above the perfect length should have great advantage over them because he may come boldly and safe without any guard or ward to the place where he may thrust home and at every thrust put him in danger of his life then can the long staff the morris pike or any longer weapon lie nowhere within the compass of the true cross to cross and uncross whereby he may safely pass home to the place where he may strike or thrust him that has the long weapon in the head face or body at his pleasure  of the lengths of the battle axe halberd or black bill or such like weapons of weight appertaining unto guard or battle 20  in any of these weapons there needs no just length but commonly they are or ought to be five or six foot long  may not well be used much longer because of their weights and being weapons for the wars and battle when men are joined close together may thrust  strike sound blows with great force both strong and quick and finally for the just lengths of all other shorter or longer weapons to be governed with both hands there is none neither is their any certain lengths in any manner of weapons to be used with one hand over or under the just length of the single sword thus ends the length of weapons  of the vantages of weapons in their kinds places  times both in private and public fight 21  first i will begin with the worst weapon an imperfect and insufficient weapon and not worth the speaking of but now being highly esteemed therefore not to be unremembered that is the single rapier and rapier and poniard  the single sword has the vantage against the single rapier  the sword and dagger has the vantage against the rapier and poniard  the sword  target has the advantage against the sword and dagger or the rapier and poniard  the sword and buckler has advantage against the sword and target the sword and dagger or rapier and poniard  the two handed sword has the vantage against the sword and target the sword and buckler the sword and dagger or rapier and poniard  the battle axe the halberd the blackbill or such like weapons of weight appertaining unto guard or battle are all one in fight and have advantage against the two handed sword the sword and buckler the sword and target the sword and dagger or the rapier and poniard  the short staff or half pike forest bill partisan or glaive or such like weapons of perfect length have the advantage against the battle axe the halberd the black bill the two handed sword the sword and target and are too hard for two swords and daggers or two rapier and poniards with gauntlets and for the long staff and morris pike  the long staff morris pike or javelin or such like weapons above the perfect length have advantage against all manner of weapons the short staff the welch hook partisan or glaive or such like weapons of vantage excepted yet are too weak for two swords and daggers or two sword and bucklers or two rapiers and poniards with gauntlets because they are too long to thrust strike and turn speedily and by reason of the large distance one of the sword and daggermen will get behind him  the welch hook or forest bill has advantage against all manner of weapons whatsoever  yet understand that in battles and where variety of weapons are among multitudes of men and horses the sword and target the two handed sword battle axe the black bill and halberd are better weapons and more dangerous in their offense and forces than is the sword and buckler short staff long staff or forest bill the sword and target leads upon shot and in troops defends thrusts and blows given by battle axe halberds black bill or two handed swords far better than can the sword and buckler  the morris pike defends the battle from both horse and man much better than can the short staff long staff or forest bill again the battle axe the halberd the black bill the two handed sword and sword  target among armed men and troops by reason of their weights shortness and great force do much more offend the enemy  are then much better weapons than is the short staff the long staff or the forest bill  of the insufficiency and disadvantages of the rapiersfight in battle 22  for the single rapier or rapier  poniard they are imperfect  insufficient weapons and especially in service of the prince when men shall join together what service can soldier do with a rapier a childish toy wherewith a man can do nothing but thrust nor that neither by reason of the length and in every moving when blows are a dealing for lack of a hilt is in danger to have his hand or arm cut off or his head cloven and for wards and grips they have none neither can any of these fine rapier men for lack of use tell how to strike a sound blow  of the vantages and sufficiency of the short sword fight in battle 23  the short sword and sword and dagger are perfect good weapons and especially in service of the prince what a brave weapon is a short sharp light sword to carry to draw to be nimble withal to strike to cut to thrust both strong and quick and what a good defence is a strong single hilt when men are clustering and hurling together especially where variety of weapons are in their motions to defend the hand head face and bodies from blows that shall be given sometimes with swords sometimes with two handed swords battle axes halberds or black bills and sometimes men shall be so near together they shall have no space scarce to use the blades of their swords below their waist then their hilts their hands being aloft defend from the blows their hands arms heads faces and bodies then they lay on having the use of blows and grips by force of their arms with their hilts strong blows at the head face arms bodies and shoulders and many times hurling together scope is given to turn down their points with violent thrusts at the faces and bodies by reason of the shortness of their blades to the mighty annoyance discomfort and great destruction of their enemies one valiant man with a sword in his hand will do better service than ten italians or italianated with their rapiers  that all manner of double weapons or weapons to be used with both hands have advantage against the single rapier or single sword there is no question to be made that the sword and buckler has the vantage against the sword and dagger 24 the dagger is an imperfect ward although borne out straight to make the space narrow whereby a little moving of the hand may be sufficient to save both sides of the head or to break the thrust from the face or body yet for lack of the circumference his hand will lie too high or low or too weak to defend both blow and thrust if he lies straight with a narrow space which is to break the thrust then he lies too weak and too low to defend his head from a strong blow if he lies high that is strong to defend his head but then his space will be too wide to break the thrust from his body the dagger serves well at length to put by a thrust and at the half sword to cross the sword blade to drive out the agent and put him in danger of his life and safely in any of these two actions defend himself but the buckler by reason of his circumference and weight being well carried defends safely in all times and places whether it be at the point half sword the head body and face from all manner of blows and thrusts whatsoever yet i have heard many hold opinion that the sword and dagger has the advantage of the sword and buckler at the close by reason of the length and point of the dagger and at the point of the sword they can better see to ward than with a buckler but i never knew any that won the close with the dagger upon the sword and buckler but did with himself out again for distance being broken judgement fails for lack of time to judge and the eye is deceived by the swift motion of the hand and for lack of true space with the dagger hand which cannot be otherwise for lack of circumference to defend both blow and thrust it is impossible for lack of true space in just time the agent having gotten the true place to defend one thrust or blow of a hundred and it is most certain whosoever closes with sword and dagger against the sword and buckler is in great danger to be slain likewise at the point within distance if he stand to defend both blow and thrust with his dagger for lack of true space and distance if he has the best eye of any man and could see perfectly which way the thrust or blow comes and when it comes as it is not to deny that he may yet his space being too large it helps him nothing because one mans hand being as swift as another mans hand both being within distance he that strikes or thrusts hurts the warder the reason is this the agent being in the first motion although in his offense further to go than the warder to defend yet the warders space being too large the blow or thrust will be performed home before the warder can come to the true place to defend himself and although the warder does perfectly see the blow or thrust coming so shall he see his own ward so far from the true place of his defence that although he does at that instant time plainly see the blow or thrust coming it shall be impossible for him to recover the true place of his ward til he his wounded but let the warder with his dagger say that it is not true which i have said for the eyes to behold the blow or thrust coming so has he as good time to defend himself herein he shall find himself deceived to this is the reason the hand is the swiftest motion the foot is the slowest without distance the hand is tied to the motion of the feet whereby the time of the hand is made as slow as the foot because whereby we redeem every time lost upon his coming in by the slow motion of the foot  have time thereby to judge when  how he can perform any action whatsoever and so have we the time of the hand to the time of the feet now is the hand in his own course more swift than the foot or eye therefore within distance the eye is deceived  judgement is lost and that is another cause that the warder with the dagger although he has perfect eyes is still within distance deceived17 for proof that the hand is swifter than the eye  therefore deceives the eyes let two stand within distance  let one of them stand still to defend himself  let the other flourish  false with his hand and he shall continually with the swift motions of his hand deceive the eyes of him that stands watching to defend himself  shall continually strike him in diverse places with his hand again take this for an example that the eyes by swift motions are deceived turn a turnwheel swift  you shall not be able to discern with your best eyes how many spokes are on the wheel no nor whether there are any spokes at all or whereof the wheel is made and yet you see when the wheel stands still there is a large distance between every spoke he that will not believe that the swift motion of the hand in fight will deceive the eye shall stare abroad with his eyes  feel himself soundly hurt before he shall perfectly see how to defend himself so those that trust to their fight the excellency of a good eye their great cunning  perfect wards of the daggers that they can see better to ward than with a buckler shall ever be deceived and when they are wounded they say the gent was a little too quick for them sometimes they say they bear their dagger a little too low sometimes they are thrust under the dagger then they say they bear it a little too high sometimes a thrust being strongly made they being soundly paid therewith say they were a little too slow  sometimes they be soundly paid with a thrust they think they were a little too quick so they that practice or think to be cunning in the dagger ward are all the days of their lives learning and are never taught18  that the sword and buckler has the vantage against the sword and target 25  the sword  target together has but two fights that is the variable fight  the close fight for the close fight the number of his feet are too many to take against any man of skill having the sword  buckler  for the variable fight although not so many in number yet too many to win the place with his foot and strike home the sword  buckler man out of his variable open  guardant fight can come bravely off  on false  double strike  thrust home  make a true cross upon every occasion at his pleasure if the sword  target man will fly to his guardant fight the breadth of the target will not suffer it if to his open fight then has the sword  buckler man in effect the sword and buckler to the single for in that fight by reason of the breadth the target can do little good or none at all  the short staff 26  now for the vantage of the short staff against the sword and buckler sword  target two handed sword single sword sword and dagger or rapier and poniard there is no great question to be in any of these weapons whensoever any blow or thrust shall be strongly made with the staff they are ever in false place in the carriage of the wards for if at any of these six weapons he carries his ward high  strong for his head as of necessity he must carry it very high otherwise it will be too weak to defend a blow being strongly made at the head then will his space be too wide in due time to break the thrust from his body again if he carries his ward lower thereby to be in equal space for readiness to break both blow  thrust then in that place his ward is too low and too weak to defend the blow of the staff for the blow being strongly made at the head upon that ward will beat down the ward and his head together and put him in great danger of his life and here is to be noted that if he fights well the staff man strikes but at the head and thrusts presently under at the body and if a blow is first made a thrust follows and if a thrust is first made a blow follows and in doing of any of them the one breeds the other so that however any of these six weapons shall carry his ward strongly to defend the first he shall be too far in space to defend the second whether it be blow or thrust  yet again for the short staff the short staff has the vantage against the battle axe black bill or halberd the short staff has the advantage by reason of the nimbleness and length he will strike and thrust freely and in better and swifter time than can the battle axe black bill or halberd and by reason of his judgement distance and time fight safe and this resolve upon the short staff is the best weapon against all manner of weapons the forest bill excepted  also the short staff has advantage against two swords and daggers or two rapiers poniards and gauntlets19 the reasons and causes before are for the most part set down already the which being well considered you shall plainly see that whensoever any one of the sword  dagger men or rapier and poniard men shall break his distance or suffer the staff man to break his that man which did first break his distance or suffer the distance to be one against him is presently in danger of death and this cannot in reason be denied because the distance appertaining to the staff man either to keep or break stands upon the moving of one large space always at the most both for his offense or safety the other two in the breach of their distance to offend the staff man have always four paces at the least therein they fall too great in number with their feet and too short in distance to offend the staff man now there rests no more to be spoken of but how the staff man shall behave himself to keep that distance that one of the sword  dagger men get not behind him while the other shall busy him before to do that is very easy by reason of the small number of his feet as it were in the center point of a wheel the other two to keep their distance are driven to run twenty feet for one as it were upon the uttermost part of the circle of the wheel all this while the staff man is very well then it comes thus to pass whether they both labor to get behind him or one keeps directly before him while the other gets behind him yet before that is brought to pass they shall either be both before him or just against both sides of him at which time soever the staff man finding either within distance he presently in making of his play slays with blow or thrust one of them or at the least puts him in great danger of his life if the staff man takes his time when they are both before him that is to say before they come to the half ring just against both sides of the staff man then he that is nearest within distance is slain by blow or thrust or put in great danger of his life but if the sword and dagger men do keep their distance until they come to the just half ring against the sides of the staff man and then break distance that man that first breaks distance is slain with blow or thrust or sore hurt and in great danger of death and the staff man in making that play at that instant must turn with one large pace which he may easily do before the other can get near enough to offend him by reason that he has to make with his feet but one large pace but the other has to make with his feet but one large pace but the other has at the least three paces but if the sword and dagger men will in the time they are before him keep their distance in the time of their being upon the middle part of the outside of the circle right against both sides of him  will labor with all heed  diligence to be both or one of them behind him that troubles the staff man nothing at all for in that very time when he finds them past the middle part of the circle he presently turns by the which he shall naturally set himself as it were in a triangle and both the sword and daggermen shall thereby stand both before him in true distance of three paces from offending of him at the least as at the first they did and take this for a true ground there is no man able to ward a sound blow with the sword and dagger nor rapier poniard and gauntlet being strongly made at the head with the staff and run in withal the force of hands in such being in his full motion and course that although the other carries his ward high and strong with both hands yet his feet being moving from the ground the great force of the blow will strike him with his ward and all down flat to ground but if he stands fast with his feet he may with both weapons together strongly defend his head from the blow but then you are sufficiently instructed the thrust being presently made after the blow full at the body it is impossible in due time to break it by reason of the largeness of his space  the short staff has the vantage against the long staff and morris pike and the forest bill against all manner of weapons 27  the reasons are these the short staff has the vantage of the long staff and morris pike in the strength  narrowness of space in his four wards of defence and the forest bill has the vantage of all manner of weapons in his strength and narrowness of space in his eight wards of defence and the rather because the bill has two wards for one against the staff or morris pike that is to say four with the staff and four with the head and is more offensive than is the staff or morris pike yet a question20 may be made by the unskillful concerning the fight between the long staff and the short in this sort why should not the long staff have advantage against the short staff since that the long staff man being at liberty with his hands may make his staff both long and short for his best advantage when he shall think it good and therefore when he shall find himself overmatched in the length of his staff by the strength of the short staff and narrowness of space of his four wards of defence he can presently by drawing back of his staff in his hands make his staff as short as the others and so be ready to fight him with at his own length to this i answer21 that when the long staff man is driven there to lie the length of his staff that will lie behind him will hinder him to strike thrust ward or go back in due time neither can he turn the contrary end of his staff to keep out the short staff man from the close nor safely to defend himself at his coming in  again of the vantages of weapons 28  make this for a general rule all long staves morris pikes forest bills javelins or such like long weapons of what sort soever being above the true lengths the shortest has the advantage because they can cross and uncross in shorter time than can the longer and all manner of short weapons to be used with both hands as staves and such like being under the perfect lengths the longest have the advantage and all manner of weapons to be used with one hand that are above the perfect length of the single sword the shortest has the vantage and all manner of weapons under the just length of the short sword as falchions skaines or hangers woodknives daggers and such like short weapons of imperfect lengths the longest has the advantage because the fight of these weapons consist within the half or quarter sword wherein by the swift motions of their hands their eyes are deceived and in those weapons commonly for their hands lie no defence and if two shall fight with staves or swords or what weapons soever the one of them having his weapon longer than the perfect length and the other shorter than the perfect length he that has the longer has the vantage because the shorter can make no true cross in true time the short staff or half pike forest bill partisan or glaive or such like weapons of perfect length to be used with both hands have the advantage against two swords and daggers or two rapiers poniards and gauntlets and against all other weapons whatsoever the forest bill excepted  again for the short staff or half pike 29  the short staff is most commonly the best weapon of all others although other weapons may be more offensive and especially against many weapons together by reason of his nimbleness and swift motions and is not much inferior to the forest bill although the forest bill is more offensive and has more wards because the staff is very uncertain but the bill is a more certain mark by reason of the breadth of the head whereby as the bill has advantage in his wards in the head so therefor has the staff the like defence or rather more to play upon the head of the bill not only to make a perfect good ward but thereby the rather to cast the bill out of the right line whereby the staff man may thrust safe and endanger the billman and the rather because therein he is the first mover wherein there is great vantage both in time and force and if the bilman is not very skillful all vantages and disadvantages of both sides being considered the short staff will prove the better weapon lastly note this22 that long staves morris pikes and such like weapons of imperfect lengths being to be used with both hands notwithstanding their imperfect lengths are perfect weapons to be used the one against the other and their fights therein perfect because in drawing of them back betwixt their hands their motion is swifter backwards than is the time of the agents feet forwards by which all their lost times are redeemed therefore these weapons in their fights the one against the other are perfect and these weapons in the night are the best weapons of all others and have great advantage against the forest bill short staff or any manner of short weapons whatsoever for these causes they boldly make home their fights and if need be against desperate men that will venture themselves to run in they redeem their lost times but the other with shorter weapons for lack of light can make no true defence thus ends the vantages of weapons  questions and answers between the scholar and the master of the vantages and disadvantages between a tall man and a man of mean stature having both the perfect knowledge in their weapons 30  scholar who has the advantage in fight of a tall man or a man of mean stature  master the tall man has the vantage for these causes23 his reach being longer and weapon unto his stature accordingly he has thereby a shorter course with his feet to win the true place wherein by the swift motion of his hand he may strike or thrust home in which time a man of mean stature cannot reach him  by his large pace in his true pace in his regression further sets himself out of danger  these are the vantages that a tall man has against any man of shorter reach than himself  scholar what vantage has a man of mean stature against a tall man  master he has none because the true times in fight and actions accordingly are to be observed and done as well by a tall man as by a man of mean stature  scholar why then if this is true that tall men have the vantage against men of mean stature it should seem in fight there is no perfection other then this when men of like stature reach  length of weapon shall fight together the which will seldom or never happen but either in the length of their weapons statures or reaches if their swords should be of just length some difference most commonly will be in their reaches  master yes verily the tall man has still the vantage and yet the fight is perfect although the men that shall happen to fight shall happen to be unequal in their statures reaches or lengths of their weapons  scholar that can i hardly believe unless you can tell me by art how to avoid or safely defend my self being but a man of mean stature against a tall man  master i will tell you there belongs unto this art of defence only to be used with the feet progression regression traversing and treading of grounds in any of these you playing the part of the patient or patient agent your feet are swifter in their motion than are the agents because his weight and number of his feet in his coming in to win the place to strike or thrust home are greater than yours and therefore the true time is yours to avoid him or safely to defend yourself so the art is still true and the tall man has still the vantage  scholar yet i am not fully satisfied herein because you tell me still that the tall man has the vantage and notwithstanding you say the art is true wherein then has the tall man the vantage when by your art you can defend yourself against him  master i will satisfy you herein thus the tall man has the vantage he can maintain his fight both by nature and by art with more ease than can the man of mean stature because the man of mean stature has thereby a further course with his feet to pass to the place wherein he may strike or thrust home and in winning of that place is driven by art to come guarded under his wards to defend himself because in the time of his coming the tall man may have both naturally or artificially strike or thrust home in which time if the man of mean stature should fail in the least iota of his art he should be in great danger of death or hurt but the tall man can naturally24 and safely come to the true place open without any artificial wards at all and therein also endanger the other or drive him still to traverse his ground with all the artificial skill that he has to defend himself and all this the tall man does by reason of his length of weapon large pace short course and long reach with great safety pleasure and ease and for those causes the tall man has still the vantage of men of mean stature and not withstanding the noble science of defence most perfect and good  of the single rapier fight between valiant men having both skill he that is the best wrestler or if neither of them can wrestle the strongest man most commonly kills the other or leaves him at his mercy 31  when two valiant men of skill at single rapier do fight one or both of them most commonly standing upon their strength or skill in wrestling will presently seek to run into the close but having both skill not without special care of their guard or cross the which they may safely do by reason of the length of the rapiers but happening both of one mind the rather do bring themselves together that being done no skill with rapiers avail they presently grapple fast their hilts their wrists arms bodies or necks as in lustring wrestling or striving together they may best find for their advantages whereby it most commonly falls out that he that is the best wrestler or strongest man if neither of them can wrestle overcomes wrestling by strength or fine skill in wrestling the rapier from his adversary or casting him from him either to the ground or to such distance that he may by reason thereof use the edge or point of his rapier to strike or thrust him leaving him dead or alive at his mercy but if one of these valiant men shall seek to run into the close and the other shall use his skill in traversing of his ground or otherwise by standing upon his guard or stocata ward to take all manner of advantages at his coming yet all avails him not because the rapiers being long the crossing of the blades cannot be avoided that being made the oppressor runs faster forwards than can the the defendant backwards and so are brought together as in the first assault they were every action therein performed  of the rapier and poniard fight betwixt valiant men having both skill 32  if two valiant men do fight at rapier and poniard having both skill one or both of them will presently press hard to win the place wherein in his judgement he may thrust home if both are of one mind the time is doubled in winning the same whereby it comes to pass that then he that first thrusts endangers kills or hurts the other and if they both thrust together as they may do by the equal time of their feet then they are most commonly both slain or both hurt and this is well known unto all men of skill that the place being once gotten there is neither judgement space pace nor time either by wards with their rapier blades or by breaking with their poniards or flying back that can preserve or defend them but if but one of them will seek to win by passage hard pressing or otherwise the place wherein in his judgement he may thrust home it is impossible for the other to deny him the same because the length of the rapiers wins him the cross the cross being taken the place is had the place being had he that first thrusts first speeds if both thrust together they are both in dange then presently follows unless it please god otherwise to have it the stabs with their daggers wherein there lies no defence  of the long rapier  poniard fight between two valiant men the one having skill the other none he that has no skill has the vantage 33  when two valiant men shall fight with long rapiers and poniards the one having skill the other none he that has no skill most commonly proves himself the better man for these causes or reasons following first the skillful man as knowing the other to have no skill or find it to be so by his shape or manner of coming towards him will presently yield to take the advantage of his coming or else with all speed put himself into his short ward to be ready at his coming to make a strong stocata as the italians call it the other knowing his imperfection in fight assures himself there can be no great good for him to stand long out at the point presently redoubles or revives his spirits with perfect resolution to make short work courageously with some offensive action such as nature shall best yield unto him flies in with all force and agility the skillful man stands watching to take such advantage as his schoolmaster has taught him in which time many times it falls out he is taught a new time seen by an unskillful man that never fought before is sore hurt or slain and if it happens they both miss in their offensive actions then by reason thereof and of the imperfect length of their rapiers they come to stabbing with their poniards wherein their lies no defence because distance being broken judgement fails time is lost and their eyes by the swift motions of their hands are deceived  of the long single rapier or rapier and poniard fight between two unskillful men being valiant 34  when two unskillful men being valiant shall fight with long single rapiers there is less danger in that kind of fight by reason of their distance in convenient length weight and unwieldiness than is with short rapiers whereby it comes to pass that what hurt shall happen to be done if any with the edge or point of their rapiers is done in a moment and presently will grapple and wrestle together wherein most commonly the strongest or best wrestler overcomes and the like fight falls out between them at the long rapier and poniard but much more deadly because instead of close and wrestling they fall most commonly to stabbing with their poniards  of the imperfection and insufficiency of rapiers in general of what length soever they are 35  if two fight with long rapiers upon every cross made with the half rapier25 if they have poniards they most commonly stab each other which cannot be avoided because the rapiers being long the cross cannot be undone of either side without going back with their feet the which likewise in due time cannot be done because the hand is more swift than the feet and the feet more swift in their course forwards than backwards neither can the cross be prevented because the point of necessity lies too far off in his offense or else within compass of the true time of the hand and body by reason of his imperfect length and so by the like reason if two fight with long single rapiers upon every cross made therewith within the half rapier the close cannot be avoided whereby it comes to pass most commonly that the strongest man or best wrestler overcomes now if two do fight with short rapiers or rapiers of convenient length such rapiers are inconvenient also for lack of hilt to defend the hand and head from the blow for no eye in making a perfect ward for the head to defend the blow can discern to take the same within three or four inches whereby it may as well and as often fall upon the hand as upon the blade of the rapier again the hilt as well serves to defend the head as the hand and is a more sure and strong ward than is the blade of the rapier and further understand this for truth that in gardant and open fight the hand without a hilt lies open to most blows that shall be struck by the agent out of gardant or open fight because in the true carriage of the gardant fight the hand must lie above the head in such straightness and narrowness of space that which way soever the agent shall strike or thrust at the head face or body the removing of two or four inches shall save all and now somewhat more for the shortness or convenient length of rapiers  rapiers having no hilts to defend the head the rapier man is driven of necessity to lie at the variable fight or low ward and being there he can neither defend in due time head face nor body from the blows or thrusts of him that shall fight out of the gardant or open fight but is continually in great danger of the agent for these causes following first because his space is too wide to defend his head from blow or thrust secondly his pace standing upon that fight will be of necessity too great or too narrow if too narrow too weak if too large his weight and number of his feet are too great to endanger him that is upon his gardant or open fight  of the imperfection and insufficiency of the fight of the single rapier rapier and poniard rapier and buckler rapier and cloak and rapier and glove of mail 36  the rapier fight whether it is single or accompanied with the poniard buckler cloak or glove of mail is still by reason of the insufficiency or imperfection of the rapier an imperfect fight imperfect instruments can make no perfect music neither can imperfect weapons make perfect fight let men that handle them have all the knowledge that may be in all manner of weapons yes the full height or perfection and habit by his great labor and industry even as it were naturally effected in him yet if the weapons that they shall fight withal be imperfect or insufficient to perform whatsoever appertains unto true fight as concerning the perfection of their safety it avails them nothing what shall we then say for the rapier is the rapier an imperfect or insufficient weapon to perform whatsoever appertains unto true fight yes wherefore because unto the true fight there appertains four fights gardant fight open fight variable fight and close fight without all four of these fights it is impossible to fight safe but the rapier for lack of a hilt is an imperfect weapon and therefore insufficient to fight safe upon these four fights for the are already set down in the paradox before but is inferred to loose the benefit of two of the best fights gardant and open fight and to fly from them and trust only unto variable fight and close fight now having proved through the imperfection or insufficiency of the rapier the imperfections of the rapier fight it remains that i speak of the rest of the weapons or instruments appertaining unto rapier fight  the rapier and poniard fight the rapier  buckler fight the rapier and cloak fight  the rapier  glove of mail fight all these fights by reason of the imperfection of the rapier and the rapier fight are also imperfect fights for proof of the uncertainty and impossibilities of the safety in any of these fights thus it stands these fights depend altogether upon variable fight and close fight in any of these fights it is impossible in true space of offense to keep the blades of their rapiers from crossing or from breaking with the poniards buckler cloak or breaking or catching with the glove of mail because in any of these two fights the agent has still in true space the blade of the patients rapier to work upon these things by letters cannot be made more plain neither is it unknown to the skilful or in fight by any means to be avoided the weapon being too far in true space to be wrought upon the place cannot be denied do the patient agent what he can for his life to the contrary either by blows thrusts falsing or doubling of thrusts going back indirections or turnings of the body or what else soever may in the highest touch of wit or strength or agility of body be devised or done to keep out the agent but still the agent by narrowness of space brings himself by strong guard to the place where being brought it is impossible to fight safe as it is for two desperate men set together being both blind because in the true place won in rapier or variable fight their eyes by the swift motions of their hands are deceived the crosses in that fight are false their distance judgement and times are lost either to offend in safety or safely to defend themselves and these reasons rules or grounds of the feats of arms are infallible or invincible  now oh you italian teachers of defence where are your stocatas imbrocatas mandrittas puntas  punta reversas stramisons passatas carricados amazzas  incartatas  playing with your bodies removing with your feet a little aside circlewise winding of your bodies making of three times with your feet together marking with one eye the motion of the adversary  with the other eye the advantage of thrusting what is become of all these juggling gambols apish devices with all the rest of your squint eyed tricks when as through your deep studies long practices  apt bodies both strong and agile you have attained to the height of all these things what then avails it you when you shall come to fight for your lives with a man of skill you shall have neither time nor place in due time to perform any one of them nor gardant nor open fight safely to keep out a man of skill a man of no skill or scholar of your own teaching from the true place the place of safety the place of uncertainty or mischief the place of wounds or death but are enforced to stand in that mischievous uncertain dangerous and most deadly place as two men having lost in part their chiefest senses most furiously with their rapiers or poniards wounding or slaying each other  thus ends the imperfect fights of the rapier with all manner of weapons or instruments thereto appertaining with their imperfections through the true grounds and rules of the art of arms truly displayed  brought to light  all laud be unto the almighty god  that the reasons used by the italian fencers in commending the use of the rapier and poniard because it makes peace makes against themselves 37  it has been commonly held that since the italians have taught the rapier fight by reason of the dangerous use thereof it has bred great civility among our english nation they will not now give the lie nor with such foul speeches abuse themselves therefore there are fewer frays26 in these times than were wont to be it cannot be denied but this is true that we are more circumspect of our words and more fearful to fight than heretofore we have been but whereof comes it is it from this that the rapier makes peace in our minds or from hence that it is not so sufficient defence for our bodies in our fight he that will fight when he is armed will not fight when he is naked is it therefore good to go naked to keep peace he that would fight with his sword and buckler or sword and dagger being weapons of true defence will not fight with his rapier and poniard wherein no true defence or fight is perfect are these insufficient weapons therefore the better because not being sufficient to defend us in fight they force us into peace what else is it but to say it is good for subjects to be poor that they not go to law or to lack munition that they may not fight nor go to the wars and to conclude what more follows through the imperfect works of the italian peacemakers they have made many a strong in his fight weak many a valiant man fearful many a worthy man trusting to their imperfect fight has been slain and many of our desperate boys and young youths to become in that rapier fight as good men as england yielded and the tallest men of this land in that fight as very boys as they and no better this good have the italian teachers of offense done us they have transformed our boys into men and our men into boys our strong men into weakness our valiant men doubtful and many worthy men resolving themselves upon their false resolutions have most willfully in the field with their rapiers ended their lives and lastly have left to remain among us after their deaths these inconveniences behind them false fencing books imperfect weapons false fights and evil customs whereby for lack of use and practice in perfect weapons and true fight we are disabled for the service of our prince defence of our country and safety of our lives in private fight  that the short sword has the advantage against the long sword or long rapier 38  whereas for the most part opinions are generally held that the long sword or long rapier has the vantage in fight against the short sword which the italian teachers of defence by their false demonstrations have brought us to believe i have thought good that the truth may appear which has the vantage to add my help unto the reasons they use in their own behalf for that yet i could never hear them make a sound reason for the same these are the reasons27 first with my long rapier i will put myself into my guard or stocata holding my hilt back by the outside of my right thigh keeping in short the point of my rapier so as he that has the short sword shall not be able to reach the point of my rapier to make his ward or cross with his dagger buckler sword or cloak without stepping in with his foot the which time is too long to answer the time of the hand by reason of my distance i can there stand safe without danger of blow or thrust playing the patients part if you strike or thrust you do it too short by reason of my distance if you seek to come nearer you must do it with the time of your foot in which time i may safely thrust home if in that distance you break it not you are slain if you do break it yet you do me no harm by reason of my distance and i may stand fast and thrust again or fly back at my pleasure so have you put yourself in danger of your life and having hardly escaped are driven again to begin a new bout as at the first you did again if i please i can be the oppressor keeping the same guard and my point in short as i did before and pressing strongly by putting in by little and little of my feet until the place of my foot is gotten wherein in my judgement i may thrust home the which i may boldly and safely do without respect of any ward at all by reason of my distance in which time of my coming he must strike thrust ward or go back if he goes back it is a great disgrace if he strikes or thrusts it is too short if he stands to defend the place being already gotten where i may thrust home the thrust being very quick  strongly made such is the force and swiftness thereof that it is impossible by nature or art for any man to break one thrust of an hundred these reasons in my opinion may suffice to confirm the wise that there is no question to be made but that the long rapier has the advantage against the short sword  sir you have prettily handled your discourse28 concerning the vantages of the long rapier against the short sword especially at the first show and according to common sense but for the substance and truth of the true fight you have said nothing because for the performance of any of your allegations you have neither true pace place time nor space these are the reasons your pace of necessity must be too large because otherwise you cannot keep safe the point of your long rapier from the cross of the short sword unless you will with a narrow pace keep back your hilt so far that the space of your offense will be too large or too long in distance and your body unapt to move and thrust both strong and quick in due time nor aptly to keep your distance to win the place with your feet to thrust home so now you may plainly see if you have skill in the art or science of defence that is to perform anything which you have alleged you have neither true pace place time nor space but if you will stand upon the largeness of your pace to keep back or save the point of your long rapier from the ward or cross of the short sword or upon your passatas in all these you have great disadvantages and these are my reasons your number will be too great as thus whenever you mean out of your large pace to thrust home you must of necessity make four times with your feet and one with your hand or two times with your feet and one with your hand at least and whensoever you make any of your passages the number of your feet are greater than the greatest of any of these times done out of the large pace but the patient with his short sword to avoid you or disappoint you of your thrust has but one time with his foot at or before the which time as he in his judgement shall find you in your motion has by the slow and great number of your motions or times sufficient time safely out of all danger to make himself ready to take his cross with his short sword now sir whether you thrust or not thrust whether you play the part of an agent or patient it helps you nothing for he that has the short sword has four times or motions against the long rapier namely bent spent lying spent and drawing back in all manner of fights these are to be observed both by the patient and agent now note he that has the long rapier must of necessity play upon one of these four motions or be patient which soever he shall do he is still in great danger of the cross of the short sword because if he is agent his number is too great he falls into one of the four motions the patient with his short sword having but the time of his hand or hand  foot safely upon these actions or times takes his cross with the short sword that being done he presently uncrosses and strikes or thrusts at his pleasure him that has the long rapier in the head face or body now here is again to be noted that when the cross is made if he that has the long rapier stands fast he is wounded presently in the uncrossing of the short sword if he steps or leaps back to save himself yet the time of the hand being swifter than the time of the foot overtakes him with blow or thrust in the arm hand head face and body now if he that has the long rapier will be patient  make no play but lie still watching to make his thrust or stocata just in the coming or moving of the agents feet with his short sword then he has as great disadvantage as he had when he was patient because then the agent with his short sword has but hand and foot to make his cross which is most safely to be done in that time which we call bent and is as impossible for the rapier man to prevent as it is for an unskillful to strike or thrust just together with a man of skill then thus do i conclude that he that fights with a long rapier against him that fights with short sword can do nothing in due time to defend himself or hurt the other but is still in danger of his life or at the mercy of him that has the short sword or else has no safe way to help himself but only cobs traverse29 this cob was a great quarreler and did delight in great bravery to give foul words to his betters and would not refuse to go into the field to fight with any man and when he came to the field would draw his sword to fight for he was sure by the cunning of his traverse not to be hurt by any man for at any time finding himself overmatched would suddenly turn his back and run away with such swiftness that it was thought a good horse would scarce take him and this when i was a young man was very much spoken of by many gentlemen of the inns of the court and was called cobs traverse and those that had seen any go back too fast in his fight would say he did tread cobs traverse  george silver his military riddle truly set down between the perfection and imperfection of fight containing the handling of the four fights wherein true consists the whole sum and full perfection of the true fight with all manner of weapons with an invincible conclusion gardant fight stays puts back or beats gardant fight  open fight stays puts back or beats open fight  variable fight answers variable fight in the first distance and not otherwise except it be with perfect length against imperfect  close fight is beaten by gardant fight  variable close  gardant fight beats gardant fight open fight variable fight and close fight  gardant fight in the imperfection of the agent or patient wins the half sword and presently the close and whosoever first ventures the close looses it and is in great danger of death and not possible to escape or get out again without great hurt  there attends most diligently upon these four fights four offensive actions which we call certain uncertain first before just and afterward they are to be performed through judgement time measure number and weight by which all manner of blows thrusts falses doubles or slips are prevented or most safely defended and thus ends my riddle  now follows the conclusion that whosoever shall think or find himself in his fight too weak for the agents or patient agent and therefore or by reason of his drunkenness or unreasonable desperateness shall press within the half sword or desperately run in of purpose to give hurt or at least for taking of one hurt to give another shall most assuredly be in great danger of death or wounds and the other shall still be safe and go free  veritas vincit  a brief note of three italian teachers of offense30 there were three italian teachers of offense in my time the first was signior rocco the second was jeronimo that was senior rocco his boy that taught gentlemen in the black friars as usher for his master in stead of a man the third was vincentio this senior rocco came into england about some thirty years past he taught the noblemen  gentlemen of the court he caused some of them to wear leaden soles in their shoes the better to bring to nimbleness of the feet in their fight he disbursed a great sum of money for the lease of a fair house in warwick lane which he called his college for he thought it great disgrace for him to keep a fence school he being then thought to be the only famous master of the art of arms in the whole world he caused to be fairly drawn and set round about his school all the noblemens and gentlemens arms that were his scholars amd hanging right under their arms their rapiers daggers gloves of mail and gauntlets also he has benches and stools the room being very large for gentlemen to sit round about his school to behold his teaching he taught none commonly under twenty forty fifty or a hundred pounds and because all things should be very necessary for the noblemen  gentlemen he had in his school a large square table with a green carpet done round with a very broad rich fringe of gold always standing upon it a very fair standish covered with crimson velvet with ink pens pendust and sealing wax and quivers of very excellent fine paper gilded ready for the noblemen  gentlemen upon occasion to write their letters being then desirous to follow their fight to send their men to dispatch their business and to know how the time passed he had in one corner of his school a clock with very fair large dial he had within his school a room the which was called the privy school with many weapons therein where he did teach his scholars his secret fight after he had perfectly taught them their rules he was very much beloved in the court  there was one austin bagger a very tall gentleman of his hands not standing much upon his skill but carrying the valiant heart of an englishman upon a time being merry among his friends said he would go fight with signior rocco presently went to signior rocco his house in the blackfriers and called to him in this manner signior rocco you are thought to be the only cunning man in the world with your weapon you that takes upon yourself to hit any englishman with a thrust upon any button you that takes upon yourself to come over the sea to teach the valiant noblemen and gentlemen of england to fight you cowardly fellow come out of your house if you dare for your life i am come to fight with thee signior rocco looking out at a window perceiving him in the street to stand ready with his sword and buckler with his two hand sword drawn with all speed ran into the street and manfully let fly at austin bagger who most bravely defended himself and presently closed with him and struck up his heels and cut him over the breech and trod upon him and most grievously hurt him under his feet yet in the end austin of his good nature gave him his life and there left him this was the first and last fight that ever signior rocco made save once at queen hith he drew his rapier upon a waterman where he was thoroughly beaten with oars and stretchers but the odds of their weapons were as great against his rapier as was his two hand sword against austin baggers sword and buckler therefore for that fray he was to be excused  then came vincentio and jeronimo they taught rapier fight at the court at london and in the country by the space of seven or eight years or thereabouts these two italian fencers especially vincentio said englishmen were strong men but had no cunning and they would go back too much in their fight which was great disgrace unto them upon these words of disgrace against englishmen my brother toby silver and myself made challenge against them both to play with them at the single rapier rapier and dagger the single dagger the single sword the sword and target the sword and buckler  two hand sword the staff battle axe and morris pike to be played at the bell savage upon the scaffold where he that went in his fight faster back than he ought of englishmen or italian should be in danger to break his neck off the scaffold we caused to that effect five or six score bills of challenge to be printed and set up from southwarke to the tower and from thence throughout london unto westminster we were at the place with all these weapons at the time appointed within a bow shot of their fence school many gentlemen of good account carried many of the bills of challenge unto them telling them that now the silvers were at the place appointed with all their weapons looking for them and a multitude of people there to behold the fight saying unto them now come and go with us you shall take no wrong or else you are shamed for ever do the gentlemen what they could these gallants would not come to the place of trial i verily think their cowardly fear to answer this challenge had utterly shamed them indeed had not the masters of defence of london within two or three days after been drinking of bottled ale hard by vincentios school in a hall where the italians must of necessity pass through to go to their school and as they were coming by the masters of defence did pray them to drink with them but the italians being very cowardly were afraid and presently drew their rapiers there was a pretty wench standing by that loved the italians she ran with outcry into the street help help the italians are like to be slain the people with all speed came running into the house and with their capes and such things as they could parted the fray for the english masters of defence meant nothing less than to soil their hands upon these two faint hearted fellows the next morning after all the court was filled that the italian teachers of fence had beaten all the masters of defence in london who set upon them in a house together this won the italian fencers their credit again and thereby got much still continuing their false teaching to the end of their lives  the vincentio proved himself a stout man not long before he died that it might be seen in his lifetime he had been a gallant and therefore no marvel he took upon him so highly to teach englishmen to fight and to set forth books of the feats of arms upon a time at wels in somersetshire as he was in great bravery among the many gentlemen of good account with great boldness he gave out speeches that he had been thus many years in england and since the time of his first coming there was not yet one englishman that could touch him at the single rapier or the rapier and dagger a valiant gentleman being there among the rest his english heart did rise to hear this proud boaster secretly sent a messenger to one bartholomew bramble a friend of his a very tall man of both his hands and person who kept a school of defence in the town the messenger by the way made the master of defence acquainted with the mind of the gentleman that sent for him and of all what vincentio had said this master of defence presently came and among all the gentlemen with his cap off prayed master vincentio that he would be pleased to take a quart of wine with him vincentio very scornfully looking upon him said unto him wherefore should you give me a quart of wine merry sir said he because i hear you are a famous man at your weapon then presently said the gentleman that sent for the master of defence he is a man of your profession my profession said vincentio what is my profession then said the the gentleman he is a master of the noble science of defence why said vincentio god made him a good man but the master of defence would not thus leave him but prayed him again he would be pleased to take a quart of wine of him then said vincentio i have no need of your wine then said the master of defence sir i have a school of defence in the town will it please you to go thither your school said master vincentio what shall i do at your school play with me said the master at the rapier and dagger if it please you play with you said master vincentioif i play with you i will hit you 1 2 3 4 thrusts in the eye together then said the master of defence if you can do so it is the better for you and the worse for me but surely i can hardly believe that you can hit me but yet once again i heartily pray you good sir that you will go to my school and play with me play with you said master vincentio very scornfully by god let me scorn to play with you with the word scorn the master of defence was very much moved and up with his great english fist and struck master vincentio such a box on the ear that he fell over and over his legs just against a buttery hatch whereon stood a great black jack the master of defence fearing the worst against vincentio his rising caught the black jack into his hand being more than half full of beer vincentio lustily started up laying his hand upon his dagger  with the other hand pointed with his finger saying very well i will cause to lie in the gaile for this geare 1 2 3 4 years and well said the master of defence since you will drink no wine will you pledge me in beer i drink to all cowardly knaves in england and i think you to be the very most coward of them all with that he cast all the beer upon him notwithstanding vincentio having nothing but his gilt rapier and dagger about him and the other for his defence the black jack would not at that time fight it out but the next day met with the master of defence in the street and said unto him you remember how misused a me yesterday you were to blame me being an excellent man me teach you to thrust two feet further than any englishman but first come you with me then he brought him to a mercers shop and said to the mercer let me see your best silken points the mercer then did presently show him some of seven groats a dozen then he paid fourteen groats for two dozen and said to the master of defence there is one dozen for you and one dozen for me this was one of the valiant fencers that came from beyond the seas to teach englishmen how to fight and this was one of the many frays that i have heard of that ever he made in england wherein he showed himself a far better man in his life than in his profession he was for he professed arms but in his life a better christian he set forth in print a book for the use of the rapier and dagger the which he called his practice i have read it over and because i find therein neither true rule for the perfect teaching of the true fight nor true ground of the true fight neither sense nor reason for due proof thereof i have thought it frivolous to recite any part therein contained yet that the truth thereof may appear let two men being well experienced in the rapier and dagger fight chose any of the best branches in the same book  make trial with force and agility without which the truth between the true  false fight cannot be known  they shall find great imperfections therein and again for proof that there is no truth neither in his rules grounds or rapier fight let trial be made in this manner31 set two unskillful men together at the rapier and dagger being valiant and you shall see that once in two bouts there shall either one or both of them be hurt then set two skillful men together being valiant at the rapier and dagger and they shall do the like then set a skillful rapier and dagger man the best that can be had and valiant man having no skill together at rapier  dagger and once in two bouts upon my credit in all the experience i have in fight the unskillful man do the other what he can for his life for the contrary shall hurt him and most commonly if it were in continuance of fight you shall see the unskillful man to have the advantage and if i should choose a valiant man for service of the prince or to take part with me or any friend of mine in a good quarrel i would chose the unskillful man because unencumbered with false fights because such a man stands free in his valor with strength and agility of body freely takes the benefit of nature fights most brave by loosing no opportunity either soundly to hurt his enemy or defend himself but the other standing for his defence upon cunning italian wards punta reversa the imbrocata stocata and being fast tied unto these false fights stands troubled in his wits and nature thereby racked through the largeness or false lyings or spaces whereby he is in his fight as a man half maimed loosing the opportunity of times and benefit of nature  whereas before being ignorant of these false rapier fights standing in the free liberty of nature given to him by god he was able in the field with his weapons to answer the most valiant man in the world but now being tied unto that false fickle uncertain fight thereby has lost in nature his freedom is now become scarce half a man and every boy in that fight is become as good a man as himself  jeronimo this gallant was valiant and would fight indeed and did as you shall hear he being in a coach with a wench that he loved well there was one cheese a very tall man in his fight natural english for he fought with his sword and dagger and in rapier fight had no skill at all this cheese having a quarrel to jeronimo overtook him upon the way himself being on horseback did call to jeronimo and bade him come forth of the coach or he would fetch him for he was come to fight with him jeronimo presently went forth of the coach and drew his rapier and dagger put himself into his best ward or stocata which ward was taught by himself and vincentio and by them best allowed of to be the best ward to stand upon in fight for life either to assault the enemy or stand and watch his coming which ward it should seem he ventured his life upon but howsoever with all the fine italianated skill jeronimo had cheese with his sword within two thrusts ran him into the body and slew him yet the italian teachers will say that an englishman cannot thrust straight with a sword because the hilt will not suffer him to put the forefinger upon the blade nor to hold the pommel in the hand whereby we are of necessity to hold fast the handle in the hand by reason whereof we are driven to thrust both compass and short whereas with the rapier they can thrust both straight and much further than we can with the sword because of the hilt and these are the reasons they make against the sword  finis  1 english masters of defence are profitable members in the commonwealth if they teach with ancient english weapons of true defence weight and convenient length within the compass of their statures and strength of men to command because it makes them safe bold valiant hardy strong and healthful and victorious in wars service of their prince defence of their friends and country but the rapier in reason not to be taught because it makes men fearful and unsafe in single combat and weak  unserviceable in wars  2 to this it will be objected that in the wars we use few rapiers or none at all but short swords to that i answer those are insufficient also for that they have no hilts whereby they are insufficient in their defence and especially for the hand which being struck although with a very small blow most commonly is the loss of a man because the force of his hand being taken from him he is neither able to defend his life nor greatly to offend his enemy and again since the rapierfight has been taught for lack of practice they have lost the use of the blow  3 why should we leave the hand naked since thereby our limbs  lives are defended our enemies discomforted wounded and executed i see no reason but that the hand should be as well armed and provided for as any other part of the body  4 a great favor to give them choice of their weapons because professors of arms ought to be skillful with all manner of weapons  5 yet they persuade us that the cross of the rapier without hilt or gauntlet is sufficient  6 no fight perfect that is not done in force  true time  7 these counterfeit shows are enough to carry the wisest that know not the true fight from the false out of the right way  8 and if their weapons were short as in times past they were yet they could not thrust safe at body or face because in guardant fight they fall over or under the perfect cross of the sword  to strike beneath the waist or at the legs is a great disadvantage because the course of the blow to the legs is too far  thereby the head face  body is discovered and that was the cause in old time that they did not thrust or strike at the legs  not for lack of skill as is these days we imagine again if man in these days should have fought with a long sword they would presently have put him into gobbs traverse  9 a confutation of their errors  10 this in truth cannot be denied  11 the blow more dangerous than the thrust  12 a blow cuts off the hand the arm the leg and sometimes the head  13 he that gives the first wound with a strong blow commands the life of the other  14 in the wars there is no observation of stocatas imbrocatas times nor answers  15 long weapons imperfect  16 if the sword is longer you can hardly uncross without going back with your feet if shorter then you can hardly make a true cross without putting in of your feet the which times are too long to answer the time of the hand the like reason for the short staff half pike forest bill partisan or glaive or such like weapons of perfect length  17 the eye is deceived by the swift motion of the hand  18 the dagger is an imperfect ward  19 the short staff or half pike has the advantage against two sword and dagger men or two rapiers poniards and gauntlets  20 a question  21 answer  22 note this  23 tall men have the vantage against men of mean stature  24 four invincible advantages consist in a tall man against a man of mean stature long reach short course length of weapon large pace  25 if they stand upon breaking with their daggers he that first wins the place and thrusts home hurts the other for lack of the circumference if both thrust together they are both sped because their spaces of defence are too wide to answer the time of the hand and by the swift motion thereof the eye in that distance is by the same deceived the feet in their course but not in the first motion always note for the avoiding of great errors  26 there are fewer frays but more valiant gentlemen slain now than were then  27 these reasons are used by the italians  28 a confutation of the italians reasons  29 cobs traverse  30 i write not this to disgrace the dead but to show their impudent boldness and insufficiency in performance of their profession when they were living that from henceforth this brief note may be a remembrance and warning to beware of bad advise  31 proofs against the rapier fight  brief instructions upon my paradoxes of defence for the true handling of all manner of weapons together with the four grounds and the four governors which governors are left out in my paradoxes without the knowledge of which no man may fight safe by george silver gentleman  sloan ms no 376  to the reader  for as much as in my paradoxes of defence i have admonished men to take heed of false teachers of defence yet once again in these my brief instructions i do the like because divers have written books treating of the noble science of defence wherein they rather teach offence than defence rather showing men thereby how to be slain than to defend themselves from the danger of their enemies as we may daily see to the great grief and overthrow of many brave gentlemen and gallant of our ever victorious nation of great britain and therefore for the great love and care that i have for the well doing and preservation  of my countrymen seeing their daily ruin and utter overthrow of the diverse gallant gentlemen and others which trust only to that imperfect fight of that rapier yes  although they daily see their own overthrow and slaughter thereby yet because they are trained up therein they think and do fully persuade themselves that there is no fight so excellent and whereas among diverse other their opinions yet leads them to this errors one of that chiefest is because there be so many slain with these weapons and therefore they hold them so excellent but these things do chiefly happen first because their fight is imperfect for that they use neither the perfect grounds of true fight neither yet the four governors without which no man can fight safe neither do they use such other rules which are required in the right use of perfect defence and also their weapons for the most part being of an imperfect length must of necessity make an imperfect defence because they cannot use them in due time and place for had these valorous minded men the right perfection of the true fight with the short sword and also of other weapons of perfect length i know that men would come safer out of the field from such bloody bankets and that such would be their perfections herein that it would save many hundred mens lives but how should men learn perfection out of such rules as nothing else but very imperfection itself and as it is not fit for a man which desires the clear light of the day to go down into the bottom of a deep and dark dungeon believing to find it there so is it as impossible for men to find perfect knowledge of this noble science where as in all their teachings every thing is attempted and acted upon imperfect rules for there is but one truth in all things which i wish very heartily were taught and practiced here among us and that those imperfect and murderous kind of false fights might be by them abolished leave now to quaff and gulp no longer of that filthy and brineish puddle seeing you may now drink of that fresh and clear spring  o that men for their defence would but give their mind to practice the true fight indeed and learn to bear true british wards for their defence which if they had it in perfect practice i speak it of my own knowledge that those imperfect italian devices with rapier and poniard would be clean cast aside and of no account of all such as blind affections do not lead beyond the bounds of reason therefore for the very zealous and unfeigned love that i bear unto your high and royal person my countrymen pitying their causes that so may brave men should be daily murdered and spoiled for want of true knowledge of this noble science and as some imagine to be only the excellence of the rapier fight and where as my paradoxes of defence is to the most sort as a dark riddle in many things therein set down therefore i have now this second time taken pains to write these few brief instructions there upon where by they may better attain to the truth of this science and laying open here all such things as was something intricate for them to understand in my paradoxes and therefore yet i have the full perfection and knowledge of the perfect use of all manner of weapons it does embolden me here to write for the better instruction of the unskillful  and i have added to these my brief instructions certain necessary admonitions which i wish every man not only to know but also to observe and follow chiefly all such as are desirous to enter into the right usage and knowledge of their weapons and also i have thought it good to annex here unto my paradoxes of defence because in these my brief instructions i have referred the reader to divers rules therein set down  this i have written for an infallible truth and a note of remembrance to our gallant gentlemen  others of our brave minded nation of great britain which here be minded to defend themselves and to win honor in the field by their actions of arms and single combats  and know that i write not this for vainglory but out of an entire love that i owe unto my native countrymen as one who laments their losses sorry that so great an error should be so carefully nourished as a serpent in their bosoms to their utter confusion as of long time have been seen whereas they would but seek the truth here in they were easily abolished therefore follow the truth and fly ignorance  and consider that learning has no greater enemy than ignorance neither can the unskillful ever judge the truth of my art to them unknown beware of rash judgment and accept my labors thankfully as i bestow them willingly censure me justly let no man despise my work herein causeless and so i refer myself to the censure of such as are skillful herein and i commit you to the protection of the almighty jehovah  yours in all love and friendly affection  george syluer  admonitions to the gentlemen and brave gallants of great britain against quarrels and brawls written by george siluer gent whereas i have declared in my paradoxes of defence of the false teaching of the noble science of defence used here by the italian fencers willing men therein to take heed how they trusted there unto sufficient reasons and proofs why and whereas there was a book written by vincentio an italian teacher whose ill using practices and unskillful teaching were such that it has cost the lives of many of our brave gentlemen and gallants the uncertainty of whose false teaching does yet remain to the daily murdering and overthrow of many for he and the rest of them did not teach defence but offence as it does plainly appear by those that follow the same imperfect fight according to their teaching or instructions by the orders from them proceeding for be the actors that follow them never so perfect or skillful therein one or both of them are either sore hurt or slain in their encounters and fights and if they allege that we use it not rightly according to the perfection thereof and therefore cannot defend ourselves to which i answer if themselves had any perfection therein and that their teaching had been a truth themselves would not have been beaten and slain in their fights and using of their weapons as they were  and therefore i prove where a man by their teaching can not be safe in his defence following their own ground of fight then is their teaching offence and not defence for in true fight against the best no hurt can be done and if both have the full perfection of true fight then the one will not be able to hurt the other at what perfect weapon so ever  for it cannot be said that if a man go to the field and cannot be sure to defend himself in fight and to come safe home if god be not against him whether he fight with a man of skill or no skill it may not be said that such a man is master of the noble science of defence or that he has the perfection of the true fight for if both have the perfection of their weapons if by any device one should be able to hurt the other there were no perfection in the fight of weapons and this firmly hold in your mind for a general rule to be the hayth and perfection of the true handling of all manner of weapons  and also whereas that said vincentio in that same book has written discourses of honor and honorable quarrels making many reasons to prove means and ways to enter the field and combat both for the lie and other disgraces all which diabolical devices tends only to villainy and destruction as hurting maiming and murdering or killing  animating the minds of young gentlemen and gallants to follow those rules to maintain their honors and credits but the end thereof for the most part is either killing or hanging or both to the utter undoing and great grief of themselves and their friends but then to late to call it again they consider not the time and place that we live in nor do not thoroughly look into the danger of the law til it be too late and for that in divers other countries in these things they have a larger scope than we have in these our days  therefore it behooves us not upon every abuse offered whereby our blood shall be inflamed or our choler kindled presently with the sword or with the stab or by force of arms to seek revenge which is the proper nature of wild beasts in their rage so to do being void of the use of reason which thing should not be in men of discretion so much to degenerate but he that will not endure an injury but will seek revenge then he ought to do it by civil order and proof by good and wholesome laws which are ordained for such causes which is a thing far more fit and requisite in a place of so civil a government as we live in then is the other and who so follow these my admonitions shall be accounted as valiant a man as he that fights and far wiser for i see no reason why a man should adventure his life and estate upon every trifle but should rather put up divers abuses offered unto him because it is agreeable to the laws of god and our country  why should not words be answered with words again but if a man by his enemy be charged with blows then may he lawfully seek the best means to defend himself and in such a case i hold it fit to use his skill and to show his force by his deeds yet so that his dealing be not with full rigor to the others confusion if possible it may be eschewed  also take heed how you appoint the field with your enemy publicly because our laws do not permit it neither appoint to meet him in private sort lest you wounding him he accuse you of felony saying you have robbed him etc or he may lay company close to murder you and then report he did it himself valiantly in the field  also take heed of your enemys stratagems lest he find means to make you look aside upon something or cause you to show whether you have on a privy coat and so when you look from him he hurt or kill you  take not arms upon every light occasion let not one friend upon a word or trifle violate another but let each man zealously embrace friendship and turn not familiarity into strangeness kindness into malice nor love into hatred nourish not these strange and unnatural alterations  do not wickedly resolve one to seek to the others overthrow do not confirm to end your malice by fight because for the most part it ends by death  consider when these things were most used in former ages they sought not so much by envy the ruin and destruction one of another they never took trial by sword but in the defence of innocence to maintain blotless honor  do not upon every trifle make an action of revenge or of defence  go not into the field with your friend at his entreaty to take his part but first know the manner of the quarrel how justly or unjustly it grew and do not therein maintain wrong against right but examine the cause of the controversy and if there be reason for his rage to lead him to that mortal resolution  yet be the cause never so just go not with him neither further nor suffer him to fight if possible it may be by any means to be otherwise ended and will him not to enter into so dangerous an action but leave it until necessity requires it  and this i hold to be the best course for it is foolishness and endless trouble to cast a stone at every dog that barks at you this noble science is not to cause one man to abuse another injuriously but to use it in their necessities to defend them in just causes and to maintain their honor and credits  therefore fly all rashness pride and doing of injury all foul faults and errors herein presume not upon this and thereby to think it lawful to offer injury to any think not yourself invincible but consider that often a very wretch has killed a tall man but he that has humanity the more skillful he is in this noble science the more humble modest and virtuous he should show himself both in speech and action no liar no vaunter nor quarreller for these are the causes of wounds dishonor and death  if you talk with great men of honorable quality with such chiefly have regarde to frame your speeches and answers so reverently that a foolish word or forward answer give no occasion of offence for often they breed deadly hatred cruel murders and extreme ruin etc  ever shun all occasions of quarrels but marshalmartial men chiefly generals and great commanders should be excellent skillful in the noble science of defence thereby to be able to answer quarrels combats and challenges in defence of their prince and country  vale  brief instructions upon my paradoxes of defence for the true handling of all manner of weapons together with the four grounds and the four governors which governors are left out in my paradoxes without the knowledge of which no man can fight safe cap i the four grounds or principals of that true fight at all manner of weapons are these four viz 1 judgment 2 distance 3 time 4 place  the reason whereof these 4 grounds or principals be the first and chief are the following because through judgment you keep your distance through distance you take your time through time you safely win or gain the place of your adversary the place being won or gained you have time safely either to strike thrust ward close grip slip or go back in which time your enemy is disappointed to hurt you or to defend himself by reason that he has lost his place the reason that he has lost his true place is by the length of time through the numbering of his feet to which he is out of necessity driven to that will be agent  the 4 governors are those that follow  1 the first governor is judgment which is to know when your adversary can reach you and when not and when you can do the like to him and to know by the goodness or badness of his lying what he can do and when and how he can perform it  2 the second governor is measure measure is the better to know how to make your space true to defend yourself or to offend your enemy  3 4 the third and forth governors are a twofold mind when you press in on your enemy for as you have a mind to go forward so must you have at that instant a mind to fly backward upon any action that shall be offered or done by your adversary  certain general rules which must be observed in that perfect use of all kind of weapons cap 2 1 first when you come into the field to encounter with your enemy observe well the scope evenness and unevenness of your ground put yourself in readiness with your weapon before your enemy comes within distance set the sun in his face traverse if possible you can still remembering your governors  2 let all your lying be such as shall best like yourself ever considering out what fight your enemy charges you but be sure to keep your distance so that neither head arms hands body nor legs be within his reach but that he must first of necessity put in his foot1 or feet at which time you have the choice of 3 actions by which you may endanger him  go free yourself  1 the first is to strike or thrust at him the instant when he has gained you the place by his coming in2  2 the second is to ward amp after to strike him or thrust from it remembering your governors  3 the third is to slip a little back  to strike or thrust after him  but ever remember that in the first motion of your adversary towards you that you slide a little back so shall you be prepared in due time to perform any of the 3 actions aforesaid by disappointing him of his true place whereby you shall safely defend yourself  endanger him  remember also that if through fear or policy he strike or thrust short  therewith go back or not go back follow him upon your twofold governors so shall your ward  slip be performed in like manner as before  you yourself still be safe  3 keep your distance  suffer not your adversary to win or gain the place3 of you for if he shall so do he may endanger to hurt or kill you  know what the place is when one may strike or thrust home without putting in of his foot  it may be objected against this last ground that men do often strike  thrust at the half sword  the same is perfectly defended where to i answer that the defence is perfectly made by reason that the warder has true space before the striker or thruster is in force or entered into his action  therefore always do prevent both blow  thrust the blow by true space4  the thrust by narrow space that is true crossing it before the same come in to their full force otherwise the hand of the agent being as swift as the hand of the patient the hand of the agent being the first mover must of necessity strike or thrust that part of the patient which shall be struck or thrust at because the time of the hand to the time of the hand being of like swiftness the first mover has the advantage  4 when your enemy shall press upon you he will be open in one place or other both at single  double weapon or at least he will be to weak in his ward upon such pressing then strike or thrust at such open or weakest part that you shall find nearest  5 when you attempt to win the place do it upon guard remembering your governors but when he presses upon you  gains you the place then strike or thrust at him in his coming in5  or if he shall strike or thrust at you then ward it  strike or thrust at him from your ward6  fly back instantly according to your governors so shall you escape safely for that first motion of the feet backward is more swift than the first motion of the feet forward where by your regression will be more swift than his course in progression to annoy you the reason is that in the first motion of his progression his number  weight is greater than yours are in your first motion of your regression nevertheless all men know that the continual course of the feet forward is more swift than the continual course of the feet backwards  6 if your enemy lies in the variable fight  strikes or thrusts at you then be sure to keep your distance  strike7 or thrust at such open part of him as are nearest unto you at the hand arm head or leg of him  go back withal  7 if 2 men fight at the variable fight  if within distance they must both be hurt for in such fight they cannot make a true cross not have time truly to judge by reason that the swift motion of the hand being a swifter mover then the eye deceives the eye at what weapon soever you shall fight withal as in my paradoxes of defence in the  chapter thereof does appear  8 look to the grip8 of your enemy  upon his slip take such ward as shall best fit your hand from which ward strike or thrust still remembering your governors  9 if you can indirect9 your enemy at any kind of weapon then you have the advantage because he must move his feet to direct himself again  you in the mean time may strike or thrust at him  fly out safe before he can offer anything at you his time will be so long  10 when you shall ward blow  thrust made at your right or left part with any kind of weapon remember to draw your hind foot a little circularly10 from that part to which the same shall be made whereby you shall stand the more apt to strike or thrust from it  a declaration of all the 4 general fights to be used with the sword at double or single long or short  with certain particular rules to them annexed cap 3 1 open fight11 is to carry your hand and hilt aloft above your head either with point upright or point backward which is best yet use that which you shall find most apt to strike thrust or ward  2 guardant fight12 in general is of 2 sorts the first is true guardant fight13 which is either perfect or imperfect  the perfect is to carry your hand  hilt above your head with your point down towards your left knee with your sword blade somewhat near your body not bearing out your point but rather declining it a little towards your said knee that your enemy cross not your point  so hurt you stand bolt upright in his fight  if he offers to press in then bear your head  body a little backward  the imperfect is when you bear your hand  sword hilt perfect high above your head as aforesaid but leaning or stooping forward with your body  thereby your space will be wide on both sides to defend the blow struck at the left side of your head or too wide to defend a thrust from the right side of the body  also it is imperfect if you bear your hand  hilt as aforesaid bearing your point too far out from your knee so that your enemy may cross or strike aside your point  thereby endanger you  the second is the bastard guardant14 fight which is to carry your hand  hilt below your head breast high or lower with your point downward toward your left foot this bastard guardant ward is not to be used in a fight except it be to cross your enemys ward at his coming in to take the grip of him or such advantage as in divers places of the sword fight is set forth  3 close fight is when you cross at the half sword either above at the forehand ward15 that is with the point high  hand  hilt low or at the true or bastard guardant ward with both your points down  4 close is all manner of fights wherein you have made a true cross at the half sword with your space very narrow  not crossed is also close fight  variable fight is all other manner of lying not here before spoken of whereof these 4 that follow are the chiefest of them16  1 stocata17 which is to lie with your right leg forward with your sword or rapier hilt back on the outside of your right thigh with your point forward to ward your enemy with your dagger in your hand extending your hand towards the point of your rapier holding your dagger with the point upright with narrow space between your rapier blade  the nails of your dagger hand keeping your rapier point back behind your dagger hand if possible  or he may lie wide below under his dagger with his rapier point down towards his enemys foot or with his point forth without his dagger  2 imbrocata18 is to lie with your hilt higher than your head bearing your knuckles upward  your point depending toward your enemys face or breast  3 mountanta19 is to carry your rapier pommel in the palm of your hand resting it on your little finger with your hand below  so mounting it up a loft  so to come in with a thrust upon your enemys face or breast as of out of the imbrocata  4 passata is either to pass with the stocata or to carry your sword or rapier hilt by your right flank with your point directly against your enemys belly with your left foot forward extending forth your dagger forward as you do your sword with narrow space between your sword  dagger blade  so make your passage upon him  also any other kind of variable fight or lying whatsoever a man can devise not here expressed is contained under this fight  of the short single sword fight20 against the like weapon cap 4 1 if your enemy lie aloft21 either in the open or true guardant fight  then strike at the left side of your head or body your best ward to defend yourself is to bear it with true guardant ward  if he strike  come in to the close or to take the grip of you you may then safely take the grip of him as it appears in the chapter on the grip  2 but if he does strike  not come in then instantly upon your ward uncross  strike him22 either on the right or left side of the head  fly out23 instantly  3 if you bear this with forehand ward be sure to ward his blow or keep your distance otherwise he shall deceive you with every false still endangering your head face hand arms body  bending knee with blow or thrust therefore keep well your distance because you can very hardly discern being within distance by which side of your sword he will strike nor at which of those parts aforesaid because of the swift motion of the hand deceives the eye  4 if he lies aloft24  strike as aforesaid at your head you may endanger him if you thrust at his hand or arm turning your knuckles downward25 but fly backward withal in the instant you thrust  5 if he lies aloft as aforesaid  strike aloft at the left side of your head if you will ward his blow with forehand ward then be sure to keep your distance except he come so certain that you sure to ward his blow at which time if he comes in withal you may endanger him from that ward either by blow thrust or grip26  6 if he lies aloft  you lie low with your sword in the variable fight then if you offer to ward his blow made at your head with true guardant ward your time will be too long due in time to make a sure ward so that it is better to bear it with the forehand ward but be sure to keep your distance to make him come in with his feet whereby his time will be too long to do what he intended  7 if 2 men fight both upon open fight he that first breaks his distance if he attempts to strike the others head shall be surely struck on the head himself if the patient agent strike there at his coming in27  slip a little back withal for that sliding back makes an indirection whereby your blow crosses his head  makes a true ward for your own this will that be because the length of time in his coming in  8 also if 2 fight upon open fight it is better for the patient to strike home strongly at the agents head when the said agent shall press upon him to win the place than to thrust because the blow of the patient is not only hurtful to the agent but also makes a true cross to defend his own head  9 if he charge you aloft out of the open or true guardant fight if you answer him with the imperfect guardant fight with your body leaning forward your space will be too wide on both sides to make a true ward in due time  your arm and body will be too near unto him so that with the bending of the body with the time of hand  foot he may take the grip of you  but if you stand upright in true guardant fight then he cannot reach to take the grip of you nor otherwise to offend you if you keep your distance without putting in of his foot or feet wherein his number will be too great28  so his time will be too long  you in that time may by putting in of your body take the grip of him if he press to come in with using only your hand or hand or foot  there upon you may strike or thrust with your sword  fly out withal according to your governors see more of this in the chapter of the grip  10 if he will still press forcibly aloft upon you charging you out of the open fight or the true guardant fight intending to hurt you in the face or head or to take the grip of you against such a one you must use both guardant  open fight whereby upon every blow or thrust that he shall make at you you may from your wards strike or thrust him on the face head or body as it appears more art large in the 5th chapter of these my instructions  11 if you fight with one standing only upon his guardant fight29 or if he seeks to come in to you by the same fight then do you strike  thrust continually at all manner of open places that shall come nearest unto you still remembering your governors so shall he continually be in danger  often wounded  wearied in that kind of fight  you shall be safe the reason is he is a certain mark to you  you are an uncertain mark to him  and further because he ties himself into one kind of fight only he shall be wearied for want of change of lying  you by reason of many changes shall not only fight at ease  much more brave but you have likewise 4 fights to his one to wit guardant open closed and variable fight to his guardant only therefore that fight only is not to be stood upon or used  12 but if all this will not serve  although he has received many wounds will continually run to come in  forcibly break your distance then may you safely take the grip of him  hurt him at your pleasure with your sword as appears in the chapter of the grip  he can neither hurt nor take the grip of you because the number of his feet are too many to bring his hand in place in due time for such a one ever gives you the place therefore be sure to take your time therein  in the like sort may you do at sword  dagger or sword  buckler at such time as i say that you may take the grip at the single sword fight you may then instead of the grip soundly strike him with your buckler on the head or stab him with your dagger  instantly either strike up his heels or fly out  as he likes a cooling card to his hot brain sick fit so let him come for another30  if 2 fight  both lie upon the true guardant fight  that one of them will need seek to win the half sword by pressing in that may you safely do for upon that fight the half sword may safely be won but he that first comes in must first go out  that presently otherwise his guard will be too wide above to defend his head or if fit for that defence then will it be too wide underneath to defend that thrust from his body which things the patient agent31 may do  fly out safe  that agent cannot avoid it because the moving of his feet makes his ward unequal to defend both parts in due time but the one or the other will be deceived  in danger for he being agent upon his first entrance his time by reason of the number of his feet will be too long so that the patient agent may first enter into his action  the agent must be of force an after doer  therefore cannot avoid this offense aforesaid  14 if he come in to encounter the close  grip upon the bastard guardant ward then you may cross his blade with yours upon the like guardant ward also  as he comes in with his feet  have gained you the place you may presently uncross  strike him a blow on the head  fly out instantly wherein he cannot offend you by reason of his lost time nor defend himself upon the uncrossing because his space is too wide whereby his time will be too long in due time to prevent your blow this may you do safely  15 if he comes in upon the bastard guardant ward bearing his hilt lower than his head or but breast high or lower then strike him soundly on the head which thing you may easily do because his space is too wide in due time to ward the same  16 if your enemy charge you upon his stocata fight you may lie variable with large distance  uncertainty with your sword  body at your pleasure yet so you may strike thrust or ward  go forth  back as occasion is to take the advantage of this coming in whether he does it out of the stocata or passata which advantage you shall be sure to have if you observe this rule  be not too rash in your actions by reason that the number of his feet will be great32  also because when those 2 fights are met together it is hard to make a true cross therefore without large distance be kept of them commonly they are both hurt or slain because in narrow distance their hands have free course  are not tied to the time of the foot by which swift motion of the hand the eye is deceived as you may read more at large in the  chapter of my paradoxes of defence  you may also use this fight against the long sword or long rapier single or double  upon this ground some shallow witted fellow may say if the patient must keep large distance then he must be driven to go back still to which i answer that in the continual motion  traverses of his ground he is to traverse circularly forewards backwards upon the right hand  upon the left hand33 the which traverses are still a certainty to be used within himself  not to be prevented by the agent because the agent comes one upon a certain mark for when he thinks to be sure of his purpose the patient is sometimes on the one side  sometimes on the other side sometimes too far back  sometimes too near so still the agent must use the number of his feet which will be too long to answer the hand of the patient agent  it cannot be denied but the patient agent by reason of his large distance still sees what the agent does in his coming but the agent cannot see what the other doeth til the patient agent be into his action therefore too late for him either to hurt the patient or in due time to defend himself because he entered into his action upon the knowledge of the patient be he knows not what the patient agent will do til it is to late  17 if the agent says that then he will stand fast upon sure guard and sometimes moving  traversing his ground  keep large distance as the patient does to which i answer that when 2 men shall meet that have both the perfection of their weapons against the best no hurt can be done otherwise if by any device one should be able to hurt the other then were there no perfection in the use of weapons this perfection of fight being observed prevents both close fight  all manner of closes grips  wrestling  all manner of such devices whatsoever  18 also if he charges you upon his stocata or any other lying after that fashion with his point low  large paced then lie you aloft with your hand  hilt above your head either true guardant or upon the open fight then he cannot reach you if you keep your distance without putting in his foot or feet but you may reach him with the time of your hand or with the time of your hand  body or of the hand body  foot because he has already put in his body within your reach  has gained you the place you are at liberty  without his reach til he puts in his foot or feet which time is too wide in that place to make a ward in due time to defend his head arms  hand one of which will be always within your reach  note still in this that your weapons be both short and of equal  convenient length of the short sword  19 if out of this variable fight he strikes at the right or left side of the head or body then your best ward is to bear with the forehand ward34 otherwise your space will be too wide  too far to make your ward in due time  20 if he lies variable after the manner of the passata then if you lie aloft as is above said you have the advantage because he that lies variable cannot reach home at head hand or arm without putting in his foot or feet  therefore it cannot be denied but that he that plays aloft has still the time of the hand to the time of the foot which fight being truly handled is invincible advantage  21 if he lies variable upon the imbrocata then make a narrow space with your point upward  suddenly if you can cross his point with your blade put aside his point strongly with your sword  strike or thrust at him  fly out instantly ever remembering your governors that he deceive you not in taking his point  22 if he strike or thrust at your leg or lower part out of any fight he shall not be able to reach the same unless you stand large paced with bending knee35 or unless he comes in with his foot or feet the which if he shall so do then you may strike or thrust at his arm or upper part for then he puts them into the place gaining you the place whereby you make strike home upon him  he cannot reach you36  but if he stands large paced with bending knee then win the place  strike home freely at his knee  fly back therewith  23 if he comes to the close fight with you  that you are both crossed aloft at the half sword with both your points upward then if he comes in withal in his crossing bear strongly your hand  hilt over his wrist37 close by his hilt putting in over at the backside of his hand  hilt pressing down his hand  hilt strongly in your entering in  so thrust your hilt in his face or strike him upon the head with your sword  strike up his heels  fly out38  24 if you are both so crossed at the bastard guardant ward  if he then presses in then take the grip of him as is shown in the chapter of the grip  or with your left hand or arm strike his sword blade strongly  suddenly toward your left side by which means you are uncrossed39  he is discovered then may you thrust him in the body with your sword  fly out instantly which thing he cannot avoid neither can he offend you  or being so crossed you may suddenly uncross  strike him upon the head  fly out instantly which thing you may safely do  go out free40  25 if you be both crossed at the half sword with his point up  your point down in the true guardant ward then if he presses to come in then either take the grip of him as in the chapter of the grip or with your left hand or arm strike out his sword blade towards your left side as aforesaid  so you may thrust him in the body with your sword  fly out instantly41  26 do you never attempt to close or come to grip at these weapons unless it be upon the slow motion or disorder of your enemy  but if he will close with you then you may take the grip of him safely at his coming in42 for he that first by strong pressing in adventures the close looses it  is in great danger by reason that the number of his feet are too great whereby his time will be too long in due time to answer the hand of the patient agent as in the chapter of the grip does plainly appear  27 always remembering if you fight upon the variable fight that you ward upon forehand ward otherwise your space will be too wide in due time to make a true guardant ward to defend yourself  28 if you fight upon open fight or true guardant fight never ward upon forehand ward for then your space will be too wide also in due time to make a sure ward  29 if he lies aloft with his point towards you after the manner of the imbrocata then make your space narrow with your point  strike or thrust as aforesaid but be sure herein to keep your distance that he deceive you not in taking of his point  of diverse advantages that you may take by striking from your ward at the sword fight43 cap 5 1 if your enemy strikes at the right side of your head you lying true guardant then put your hilt a little down mounting your point so that your blade may cross across your face44 so shall you make a true ward for the right side of your head from which ward you may instantly strike him on the right or left side of the head or turn down your point  thrust him in the body or you may strike him on the left side of the body or on the outside of his left thigh  or you may strike him on the outside of the right thigh one of those he cannot avoid if he fly not back instantly upon his blow because he knows not which of these the patient agent will do  2 if you lie upon your true guardant ward  he strikes at the left side of your head45 you have the choice from your ward to strike him from it on the right or left side of the head or to turn down your point  thrust him in the body or you may strike him on the outside of the right or left thigh for the reason above said in the last rule except he flies out instantly upon his blow  3 if he charge you upon the open or the true guardant fight if you will answer him with the like then keep your distance  let your gathering be always in your fight to ward his right side so shall you with your sword choke up any blow that he can make at you from the which ward you may strike him on the right or left side of the head or thrust him in the body  but if he thrust at your face or body then you may out of your guardant fight break it downward with your sword bearing your point strongly towards your right side46 from the which breaking of his thrust you may likewise strike him from the right or left side of the head or thrust him in the body  4 if you meet with one that cannot strike from his ward upon such a one you may both double  false47  so deceive him but if he is skillful you must not do so because he will be still so uncertain in his traverse that he will still prevent you of time  place so that when you think to double  false you shall gain him the place  there upon he will be before you in his action  your coming he will still endanger you  5 if you fight upon the variable fight  that you receive a blow with forehand ward made at the right side of your head or body48 you have the choice of 8 offensive actions from that ward the first to strike him on the right side either on the head shoulder or thigh or to thrust him in the body or to strike him on the left side either on the head shoulder or thigh or to thrust him in the body the like you may do if he strike ever at your left side as is above said if you bear it with your forehand ward49  6 in this forehand ward keep your distance  take heed that he deceives you not with the downright blow at your head out of his open fight for being within distance the swift motion of the hand may deceive your eye because you know not by which side of your sword his blow will come  7 also see that he deceive you not upon any false offering to strike at the one side  then thereby you have turned your point aside then to strike on the other side but if you keep distance you are free from that therefore still in all your actions remember your governors  8 if he will do nothing but thrust answer him as it is set down in the 16th ground of the short sword fight  also in diverse places of the 8th chapter  9 also consider if he lies at the thrust upon the stocata or passata  you have no way to avoid him except you can cross his sword blade with yours  so indirect his point therefore keep narrow space upon his point  keep well your distance in using your traverses50  but if he puts forth his point so that you may cross it with forehand ward for if you watch for his thrust then lie upon forehand ward with point a little up if he lies with his pointed mounted  if you single your thrust upon the outside of your sword to ward your right side or back of your sword hand strike or bear his point out towards your right side  thereupon putting forward your body  left foot circularly toward his right side you may strike him upon his sword arm head face or body51  or if you take it on the inside of your sword blade to ward your left side52 then with your sword put by his point strongly  suddenly towards your left side drawing your left circularly back behind the heel of your right foot  strike him on the inside of his sword hand or arm or on the head face or body  fly out according to your governors  this may you use against the sword  dagger long or short or rapier  poniard or sword  buckler  10 also remember if he has a long sword  you a short sword ever to make your space too narrow that you may always break his thrust before that be in force if possible you may  also to keep large distance whether he charge you out of the stocata passata or imbrocata etc  of this you may see more at large in the 8th chapter  the manner of certain grips  closes to be used at the single short sword fight etc cap 6 1 if he strike aloft at the left side of your head and run in withal to take the close or grip of you then ward it guardant  enter in with your left side putting in your left hand on the inside of his sword arm near his hilt bearing your hand over his arm  wrap in his hand  sword under your arm as he comes in wresting his hand  sword close to your body turning back your right side from him so shall he not be able to reach your sword but you shall still have it at liberty to strike or thrust him  endanger the breaking of his arm or the taking away of his sword by that grip  2 if you are both crossed in the close fight upon the bastard guardant ward low you may put your left hand on the outside of his sword at the back of his hand near or at the hilt of his sword arm  take him on the inside of the arm with your hand above his elbow is best  draw him towards you strongly wresting his knuckles downward  his elbow upwards so may endanger to break his arm or cast him down or to wrest his sword out of his hand  go free yourself  3 in like sort upon this kind of close you may clap your left hand upon the wrist of his sword arm holding it strongly  therewith thrust him hard from you  presently you may thrust him in the body with your sword for in that instant he can neither ward strike nor thrust  4 if he strike home at the left side of your head  there withal come in to take the close or grip of your hilt or sword arm with his left hand first ward his blow guardant  be sure to put in your left hand under your sword  take hold on the outside of his left hand arm or sleeve putting your hand under the wrist of his arm with the top of your fingers upward  your thumb  knuckles downward then pluck him strongly towards your left side so shall you indirect his feet turning his left shoulder toward you upon which instant you may strike or thrust him with your sword  fly out safe for his feet being indirected although he has his sword at liberty yet shall he be not able to make any offensive fight against you because his time will be too long to direct his feet again to use his sword in due time  5 also if he attempts to close or grip with you upon his bastard guardant ward then cross his sword with the like ward  as he comes in with his feet you have the time of your hand  body whereby with your left hand or arm you may put by his sword blade which thing you must suddenly  strongly do casting it towards your left side so may you uncross  thrust him in the body with your sword  fly out instantly for if you stay there he will direct his sword again  endanger you this may safely be done or you may uncross  turn your point up  strike him on the head  fly out instantly  6 if he presses in to the halfsword upon a forehand ward then strike a sound blow at the left side of his head turning strongly your hand  hilt pressing down his sword hand  arm strongly  strike your hilt full in his face bearing your hilt strongly upon him for your hand being uppermost you have the advantage of the grip for so may you break his face with your hilt  strike up his heels with your left foot and throw him a great fall all this may safely be done by reason that he is weak in his coming in by that moving of his feet  you repel him in the fullness of your strength as appears in the chapter of the short single sword fight in the 23rd ground of the same  7 remember that you never attempt the close nor grip but look to his slip consider what is said in the 8th general rule in the second chapter  also in the 26th ground of the single sword fight in the 4th chapter  of the short sword  dagger fight against the like weapon cap 7 1 observe at these weapons the former rules defend with your sword  not your dagger yet you may cross his sword with your dagger if you may conveniently reach the same therewith without putting in your foot only by bending in your body otherwise your time will be too long  his time will be sufficient to displace his own so that you shall not hit it with your dagger  so he may make a thrust upon you this time that i here mean of putting by of his sword is when he lies out spent with his sword point towards you  not else which thing if you can do without putting in your foot then you may use your dagger  strike strongly  suddenly his sword point therewith up or down to indirect the same that done instantly therewith strike or thrust at him with your sword  2 also you may put by his sword blade with your dagger when your swords are crossed either above at forehand ward or below at the bastard guardant ward  therewith instantly strike or thrust with your sword  fly out according to your governors of this you may see more at large in the chapter of the single sword fight in the 24th ground of the same  3 also if he is so foolhardy to come to the close then you may guard with your sword  stab with your dagger  fly out safe which thing you may do because his time is too long by the number of his feet  you have but the swift time of your hand to use  he cannot stab til he has setted in his feet  so his time is to late to endanger you or to defend himself  4 know that if you defend yourself with your dagger in other sort than is aforesaid you shall be in danger to be hurt because the space of your dagger will be still too wide to defend both blow  thrust for lack of circumference as the buckler has  5 also note when you defend blow  thrust with your sword you have a nearer course to offend your enemy with your sword than when you ward with your dagger for then you may for the most part from your ward strike or thrust him  6 you must neither close nor come to the grip at these weapons unless it is by the slow motion or disorder of your adversary yet if he attempts to close or to come to the grip with you then you may safely close  hurt him with your dagger or buckler  go free yourself but fly out according to your governors  thereby you shall put him from his attempted close but see you stay not at any time within distance but in due time fly back or hazard to be hurt because the swift motion of the hand being within distance will deceive the eye whereby you shall not be able to judge in due time to make a true ward of this you may see more in the chapter of the back sword fight in the 12th ground of the same  7 if he extends forth his dagger hand you may make your fight the same remembering to keep your distance  to fly back according to your governors  every fight  ward with these weapons made out of any kind of fight must be made  done according as is taught in the back sword fight but only that the dagger must be used as is above said instead of the grip  8 if he lies bent upon his stocata with his sword or rapier point behind his dagger so you cannot reach the same without putting in your foot then make all your fight at his dagger hand so that you may cross his sword blade with yours then make narrow space upon him with your point  suddenly  strongly strike or bear his point towards his right side indirecting the same  instantly strike or thrust him on the head face arm or body  fly back therewith out of distance still remembering your governors  9 if he lies spent upon his variable fight then keep your distance  make your space narrow upon him til you may cross his sword or rapier point with your sword point whereupon you having won or gained the place strike or thrust instantly  10 if he lies bent or spent upon the imbrocata bear up your point  make your space narrow  do the like  of the short sword  dagger fight against the long sword  dagger or long rapier  poniard cap 8 1 if you have the short sword  dagger defend with your sword  not with your dagger except you have a gauntlet or hilt upon your dagger hand then you may ward upon forehand ward upon the double with the point of your sword towards his face  2 lie not aloft with your short sword if he lies low variable upon the stocata or passata etc for then your space will be too wide to make a true cross in due time or too far in his course to make your space narrow which space take heed to make very narrow yes so that if it touches his blade it is better  3 i say make your space narrow until you can cross his sword blade strongly  suddenly so shall you put by his point out of the right line  instantly strike or thrust  slip back according to your governors  but take heed unless you can surely  safely cross go not in but although you can so cross  thereupon you enter in stay no by it but fly out according to your governors  4 if with his long sword or rapier he charges you aloft out of his open or true guardant fight striking at the right side of your head if you have a gauntlet or closed hilt upon your dagger hand then ward it double with forehand ward bearing your sword hilt to ward your right shoulder with your knuckles upward  your sword point to ward the right side of his breast or shoulder crossing your dagger on your sword blade53 resting it there upon the higher side of your sword bearing both your hilts close together with your dagger hilt a little behind your sword bearing both your hands right out together spent or very near spent when you ward his blow meeting him so upon your ward that his blow may light at your half sword or within so that his blade may slide from your sword  rest with your dagger at which instant time thrust forth your point at his breast  fly out instantly so shall you continually endanger him  go safe yourself  5 if he strikes a loft at the left side of your head ward as aforesaid bearing your sword hilt towards your left shoulder with your knuckles downward54  your sword point towards the left side of his breast or shoulder bowing your body  head a little towards him  remember to bear your ward to both sides that he strike you not upon the head then upon his blow meet his sword as aforesaid with your dagger crossed over your sword blade as before when his sword by reason of his blow upon your sword shall slide down  rest upon your dagger then suddenly cast his sword blade out toward your left side with your dagger to indirect his point  therewith thrust at his breast from your ward  fly out instantly the like may you do if his sword glance out from yours upon his blow  all this may safely be done with the short sword  closed hilted dagger or gauntlet  6 stay not within distance of the long sword or rapier with your short sword nor suffer him to win the place of you but either cross his sword or make your space very narrow to cross it before his blow or thrust be in force yet keeping your distance whereby he shall strike or thrust at nothing  so shall be subject to the time of your hand against the time of his feet  7 keep distance  lie as you think best for your ease  safety yet so that you any strike thrust or ward  when you find his point certain then make your space narrow  cross his sword so shall you be the first mover  enter first into your action  he being an after doer is not able to avoid your cross not narrow space nor any such offense as shall be put into execution against him  8 having crossed his long sword or rapier with your short sword blade  put his point out of the straight line by force then strike or thrust at him with your sword  fly out instantly according to your governors  9 stand not upon guardant fight only for so he will greatly endanger you out of his other fights because you have made yourself a certain mark to him for in continuing in that fight only you shall not only weary yourself but do also exclude yourself from the benefit of the open variable  closed fights  so shall he have four fights to your one as you may see in the chapter of the short single sword fight in the 15th ground thereof  if he lies in open or true guardant fight then you may upon your open or guardant fight safely bring yourself to the half sword  then you may thrust him in the body under his guard or sword when he bears it guardant because he is too weak in his guard but fly out instantly  he cannot bring in his point to hurt you except he goes back with his foot or feet which time is too long to answer the swift time of the hand  if he puts down his sword lower to defend that thrust then will his head be open so that you may strike him on the head over his sword  fly out therewith which thing he cannot defend because his space is too wide to put up his blade in due time to make a true ward for the same  11 understand that the whole sum of the long rapier fight is either upon the stocata passata imbrocata or mountanta all these and all the rest of their devices you may safely prevent by keeping your distance because thereby you shall still drive him to use the time of his feet whereby you shall still prevent him of the true place  therefore he cannot in due time make any of these fights offensive upon you by reason that the number of his feet will still be too great so that he shall still use the slow time of his feet to the swift time of your hand  now you can plainly see how to prevent all these but for the better example note this whereas i say by keeping of distance some may object that then the rapier man will come in by degrees with such ward as shall best like him  drive back the sword man continually to whom i answer the he can not do by reason that the sword mans traverses are made circularly so that the rapier man in his coming in has no place to carry the point of his rapier in due time to make home his fight but that still his rapier will lie within the compass of the time of the sword mans hand to make a true cross upon him the which cross being made with force he may safely uncross  hurt the rapier man in the arm head face or body with blow or thrust  fly out safe before he shall have tie to direct his point again to make his thrust upon the sword man  12 if the rapier man lies upon the stocata first make your space narrow with your short sword  take heed that he strikes not down your sword point with his dagger  so jump in  hurt you with the thrust of his long rapier which thing he may do because he has commanded your sword  so you are left open  discovered  left only unto the uncertain ward of your dagger which ward is to single for a man to venture his life on which if you miss to perform never so little you are hurt or slain  13 to prevent this danger you must remember your governors  presently upon his least motion be sure of your distance  your narrow space then do as follows  14 if he lies upon his stocata with his rapier point within or behind his dagger hand out straight then lie upon variable in measure with your right foot before  your sword point out directly with your space very narrow as near his rapier point as you may between his rapier point  his dagger hand from which you may suddenly with a wrist blow lift up your point  strike him on the outside or inside of his dagger hand  fly out withal then make your space narrow as before then if he thrust home at you you are already prepared for his thrust or you may thrust at his dagger hand doing which you may think best but your blow must be only by moving your wrist for if you lift up your hand  arm to fetch a large blow then your time will be too long  your space to wide in due time to make a true ward to defend yourself from his thrust so shall you hurt him although he has a gauntlet thereon for your thrust will run up between his fingers  your blow will cut off the fingers of his gauntlet for he cannot defend himself from one blow or thrust of 20 by reason that you have the place to reach home at his hand  for that cause he cannot prevent it neither can he reach home to you without putting in his foot or feet because the distance is too large but upon every blow or thrust that you make at his hand slip back a little so you shall still upon every blow or thrust that you make at him be out of his reach  but if upon your blow or thrust he will enter in with his foot or feet to make home his stocata or thrust upon you then by reason of you sliding back you shall be prepared in due time to make a perfect ward to defend yourself with your sword  therefore ever respect his rapier point  remember to make  keep narrow space upon it with your sword point that you may be sure to break his thrust before it is in full force  15 if he thrust at your higher parts with his point a little mounted then make narrow your space with your point upon his if you cross his blade on the inside between his rapier  his dagger if he presses in then from your cross beat or bear back his point strongly towards his right side  having indirected his point strike him on the inside of the rapier or dagger hand or arm or on the head face or body  fly out instantly  or you may upon his pressing in with his thrust slip your point down as he comes in  put up your hilt  ward it guardant  therewith from that ward cast out his point  suddenly strike him in one of the places aforesaid  fly out instantly remembering your governors  16 if he lies fast  does not come in then strike  thrust at his dagger hand with your wrist blow  slip back therewith every time  17 but if he lies fast  beats down your point with his dagger  then thrusts at you from his stocata then turn up your hilt with your knuckles upward  your nails downward taking his blade upon the backside of yours towards your left side  bear it guardant towards that side  so may you offend him as before is said upon that ward  18 the like may you do upon him if he lays out his point when you have crossed the same with yours  then strike it to either side  so indirect his point and then strike or thrust  fly out  19 the like you must do if he lies with his point direct towards your belly  20 but if you cross his point so mounted or directed as above said upon the outside of your sword with his point a little higher than your hilt so that you may cross his blade then if he thrust over your blade single uncrossing the same then you may break it with your forehand ward out towards your right side  if he comes in therewith then strike him on the outside of his rapier hand or arm or on the head or face  fly out therewith  21 but if he thrusts in over your sword as above said  presses in his blade strongly double with the help of his dagger then put down your point  turn up your hilt guardant so shall you safely defend it bearing it guardant out towards your left side  from that strike him in between his rapier and dagger in one of the aforesaid places  fly out  but if from the cross he slips his point down to thrust under your sword then strike down his point towards his left foot  therewith strike him on the outside of his rapier hand or arm head face or body  fly out instantly according to your governors  also you may upon this of his point down then turn your point short over his blade in your stepping back  put your point down in the inside of his blade turning up your hilt guardant as aforesaid  then if he thrusts at you bear it guardant towards your left side  then have you the same offensive blows  thrusts against him as is above said upon the same ward  22 if he lies after the stocata with his point down towards your foot then cross his blade on the outside  if he turns his point over your blade to make his thrust upon you bear it out towards your left side  from that ward offend him as aforesaid  23 also in this fight take heed that he thrusts you not in the sword hand or arm therefore ever respect to draw it back in due time remembering therein your twofold governor in your coming in to make your cross or narrow space  24 if at sword  dagger or buckler he strikes in at the outside of your right leg ward it with the back of your sword carrying your point down bearing you knuckles downward  your nails upward55 bearing your sword out strongly towards your right side upon which ward you may strike him on the outside of the left leg or thrust him in the thigh or belly  25 the like may you do if he strike at your other side if you ward his blow with the edge of your sword your hand and knuckles as aforesaid56 casting out his sword blade towards your left side this may be used at short or long sword fight  26 you must never use any fight against the long rapier  dagger with your short sword but the variable fight because your space will be too wide  your time too long to defend or offend in due time  27 also you must use very large distance ever because out of that fight you can hardly make a true cross because being within distance the eye is deceived to it in due time  28 remember in putting forth your sword point to make your space narrow when he lies upon his stocata or any thrust you must hold the handle thereof as it were along your hand resting the pommel thereof in the hollow part of the middle of the heel of your hand towards the wrist  the former part of the handle must be held between the forefinger  thumb without the middle joint of the forefinger towards the top thereof holding that finger somewhat straight out gripping round your handle with your other 3 fingers57  laying your thumb straight towards his the better to be able to perform this action perfectly for if you grip your handle close out thwart in your hand then you cannot lay your point straight upon his to make your space narrow but that your point will still lie too wide to do the same in due time  this is the best way to hold your sword in all kinds of variable fight  but upon your guardant or open fight then hold it with full gripping it in your hand  not laying your thumb along the handle as some use then shall you never be able to strongly to ward a strong blow58  this have i written out of my entire love that i bear to my countrymen wishing them yet once again to follow the truth  to fly the vain imperfect rapier fight the better to save themselves from wounds  slaughter for who so attains to the perfection of this true fight which i have here set forth in these my brief instructions  also in paradoxes of defence shall not only defend themselves but shall thereby bring those that fight upon the imperfect fight of the rapier under their mercy or else put them in cobbs traverse59 where of you may read in the 38th chapter of my paradoxes aforesaid  of the sword  buckler fight cap 9 sword  buckler fight  sword  dagger fight are all one saving that you may safely defend both blow  thrust single with your buckler only  in like sort you may safely ward both blows  thrusts double that is with sword  buckler together which is a great advantage against the sword  dagger etc  is the surest fight of all short weapons  of the two hand sword fight against the like weapon cap 10 these weapons are to be used in the fight as the short staff if both play upon double  single hand at the 2 hand sword the long sword has the advantage if the weight thereof is not too heavy for his strength that has it but if both play only upon double hand then his blade which is convenient length agreeing with his stature that has it which is according with the length of the measure of his single sword blade has the advantage of the sword that is too long for the stature of the contrary party because he that can cross  uncross strike  thrust close  grip in shorter time than the other can  of the short staff fight being of convenient length against the like weapon cap 11 the short staff has 4 wards that is 2 with the point up  2 with the point down  1 at these weapons ever lie so you may be able to thrust single  double  to ward strike or thrust in due time so shall your enemy if he strikes only upon double hand be driven of necessity seeking to win the place to gain you the place whereby you may safely hurt him  go free yourself by reason of your distance  where you shall seek to win the place upon him he shall not be able to gain the place upon you nor keep the place from you whereby he shall either be hurt or in great danger of hurt by reason of your large reach true place  distance your fight being truly handled keeping itself from close  grip  2 and in like sort shall it be between two which shall play upon the best that is if they play both double  single handed  3 if you find yourself too strong for your adversary in any manner of ward whether the same be above or below put by his staff with force  then strike or thrust him from it  4 but if you find him too strong for you upon his blows from aloft so that you can hardly bear them upon your ward then when he strikes in aloft at your head  by his main strength would beat down your staff  so give you a hurt before you shall be able to come again into your ward  against such a one give a slip in the sort suddenly draw back the higher part of your body a little  your foremost foot withal  slip in the point of your staff under his staff  thrust single at him  fly out with all so shall you be sure to hit him  go out free  5 if he lies aloft with his staff then you lie with your back hand low with your point upwards towards his staff making your space narrow because you may cross his staff to ward his blow before it comes into full force  then strongly  suddenly misdirect his point  so thrust at him single the which you may do before he can remove his feet by reason of the swiftness of your hand or fly out therewith do this for both sides of the head if cause requires it so shall you save both your head body and all parts for your upper parts are guarded  your lower parts far out of his reach  6 if he lies low with his point down then lie you with your point down also with your foremost hand low  your hind most hand high so that you may cross his staff  do all things as said in the other  7 if he lies upon the thrust then you lie with your space narrow lying up or down with your point in such sort as you may cross his staff  thereby you shall be able to put or beat by his thrust before it is in full force  then strike or thrust ever remembering your governors  if upon this any will object that if this is true then it is in vain to strike to thrust because he that does it is still in danger this doubt is answered in the short single sword fight in the 12th ground thereof  8 if your adversary strikes aloft at any side of your head or body ward it with your point up  making your space so narrow that you may cross his staff before it comes in full force bearing or beating down his blow strongly back again towards that side that he strikes in at you  out of that ward then instantly either strike from that ward turning back your staff  strike him on that side of the that is next to your staff  or lift up your staff again  so strike him on the head or body or thrust at his body double or single as you may find your best advantage ever in holding your staff let there be such convenient space between your hands wherein you shall find yourself most apt to ward strike or thrust to your best liking  9 if you play with your staff with your left hand before and your right hand back behind as many men find themselves most apt when that hand is before  if your adversary upon his blow comes in to take the close of you when you find his staff crossed with yours near his hand then suddenly slip up you right hand close to the hind side of your foremost hand  presently loosing the hind side of your foremost hand  put in under your own staff  then cross or put by his staff therewith your hand take hold of his staff in such sort that your little finger be towards the point of his staff  your thumb  forefinger towards his hands  presently with your right hand mount the point of your own staff casting the point thereof over your right shoulder with your knuckles downwards  so stab him in the body or face with the hind end of your staff but be sure to stab him at his coming in whether you catch his staff or not for sometimes his staff will lie to far out that upon his coming in you cannot reach it then catch that arm in his coming in which he shall first put forth within your reach but be sure to stab for his staff can do you no hurt and having so done if you find yourself too strong for him strike up his heels if too weak fly out  10 the like must you do if you play with your right hand before  your left hand back behind but if you need not to slide forth your left hand because your right hand is in the right place on your staff already to use in that action but then you must displace your left hand to take hold of his staff or the grip as is aforesaid  to use the stab as is above said  11 if both lie aloft as aforesaid  play with the left hand before if he strikes at the right side of your head or body then must you cross his staff before his blow is in full force by making your space narrow  then strike it strongly back again towards his left side  from that ward you may turn back your staff  strike him backward  therewith on the left side of his head or lift up your staff  strike him on the right or left side of the head body or arm or thrust him in the body the like blows or thrusts any you make at him whether he strikes or thrusts having put by his staff remembering your governors  the like order must you use in playing with the right hand foreward  12 but if he thrusts at you continually then ever have a special care to consider whether he lies aloft or below  does continually thrust at you therefrom then look that you always lie so that you make your space so narrow upon him that you are sure to cross his staff with yours  put it before it is in full force and from that ward thrust at him single or double as you find it best  if he remembers not to fly back at the instant when he thrusts it will be too late for him to avoid any thrust that you shall make at him  of the short staff fight against the long staff cap 12 1 if you have a staff of the convenient length against a staff of longer length than is convenient then make your space narrow  seek not to offend until you have strongly  swiftly put by his point which you shall with ease accomplish by reason of your narrow space  your force then strike or thrust him as you shall think best  2 this short staff fight against the long staff is done in the same sort that short staff fight to short staff fight is done but that the man with the short staff must always remember to keep narrow space upon the long staff where so ever the long staff shall lie high or low continually make your space narrow upon him so shall you be sure if he strikes or thrusts at you to take the same before it is into its full force  by reason that your force is more with your short staff than his can be at the point of his long staff you shall cast his staff so far out of the straight line with your short staff that you may safely enter in with your feet  strike or thrust home at him  3 yet this present shift he has at that instant he may slip back his staff in his hands which time is swifter then your feet coming forward whereby he will have his staff as short as yours yet by reason that at the first you cast his staff so far out of the right line that you had time to enter with your feet you shall then be so near him that you make narrow space upon him again so that he shall have no time to slip foreward his staff again in his former place nor go back with his feet  so to recover the hind end of his staff again because if he slips forth his staff to strike or thrust at you that may you safely defend because of your narrow space upon him  therewithal you may strike or thrust him from your ward either at single or double  4 but if he will go back with his feet thinking by that means to recover the whole length of his staff again that can he not do in convenient time because the time of your hand is swifter than the time of his feet by reason whereof you may strike or thrust him in his going back  5 again it is to be remembered in that time that you keep him at bay upon the drawing in of his staff the hind end thereof lying so far back behind will be so troublesome for him that he can make no perfect fight against you  commonly in his drawing in of his staff it will be too short to make a true fight against you neither to offend you or make himself safe  6 if he attempts the close with you then stab him with the hind end of your staff as said in the fight of the 2 short staves of convenient length in the 9th ground thereof  note remember that at the morris pike forest bill long staff  two handed sword that you lie in such sort upon your wards that you may both ward strike  thrust both double  single  then return to your former wards slips  lie again  then are you as you were before  the like fight is to be used with the javelin partisan halberd black bill battle axe glaive half pike etc  of the fight of the forest bill against the like weapon  against the staff cap 13 1 the forest bill has the fight of the staff but it has 4 wards more with the head of the bill that is one to bear it upwards another to beat it downwards so that the carriage of your bill head is with the edge neither up nor down but sideways  the other 2 wards are one to cast his bill head downwards towards the right side  the other towards the left  and upon either one of these wards or catches run up to his hands with the head of your bill  then by reason that you have put his staff out of the right line you may catch at his head neck arm or legs etc with the edge of your bill  hook or pluck him strongly to you  fly out withal  2 if you cast his staff so far out that your bill slides not up to his hands then you may safely run in sliding your hands within one yard of the head of your bill  so with your bill in one hand take him by the leg with the blade of your bill  pluck him to you  with your other hand defend yourself from his gripping if he offers to grapple with you  if you fight bill to bill do the like in all respects as with the staff in your fight for your bill fight  staff fight is all one but only for the defence  offense with the head of the bill  where the staff man upon the close if he uses the stab with the butt end of his staff the bill man at that time is to use the catch at the leg with the edge of his bill in the second ground above is said  4 remember ever in all your fights with this weapon to make your space narrow whether it is against the staff or bill so that whatsoever he shall do against you you shall still make your ward before he is in his full force to offend you  5 also if you can reach within the head of his bill with the head of your bill then suddenly with the head of your bill snatch his bill head strongly towards you  therewithal indirect his bill head  forcibly run up your bill head to his hands so have you the like advantage as above said whereas i spoke of running up towards his hands  6 if he lies low with this bill head then if you can put your bill head in over the head of his bill  strongly put down his bill staff with your bill head bearing it flat then you may presently run up your bill head single handed to his hands  fly out therewith so shall you hurt him in the hands  go free yourself  7 the like may you do with your bill against the short staff if you can press it down in the like sort but if he has a long staff then run up double handed with both hands upon your bill which thing you may safely do because you are in your strength  have taken him in the weak part of his staff  8 if he lies high with his bill head then put up your bill head under his  cast out his bill to the side that you shall find most fit so have you the advantage to thrust or hook at him  fly out  or if you cast out his bill far out of the right line then run in  take him by the leg with the edge of your bill as is said in the 2nd ground of this chapter  9 if you ward his blow with the bill staff within your bill head then answer him as with the short staff  note that as the bill mans advantage is to take the staff with the head of the bill so that the staff man by reason that the head of the bill is a fair mark has the advantage of him in the casting aside of the head of the bill with his staff or beating it aside the which if the bill man looks not very well into the staff man thereupon will take all manner of advantages of the staff fight against him  of the fight of the morris pike against the like weapon cap 1460 1 if you fight with your enemy having both morris pikes with both points of your pikes forewards low upon the ground holding the butt end of the pike in one hand single with knuckles upwards  the thumb underneath with the thumb  forefinger towards your face  the little finger towards the point of the pike bearing the butt end of the pike from the one side to the other right before your face then lie you with your arm spent  your body open with your hand to your right side with your knuckles downwards  your nails upwards  or you may lie in that sort with your hand over to the left side with your knuckles upwards  your nails downwards whereby all your body will be open if then he shall suddenly raise up the point of his pike with his other hand  come thrust at you then in the mounting of his point or his coming in suddenly toss the point of your pike with your hand single  so thrust him in the legs with your pike  fly out therewith  or else you may stand upon your ward  not toss up your point but break his thrust by crossing the point of his pike with the middle of your pike by casting up your hand with the butt end of your pike above your head  so bearing over his point with your staff to the other side as for example  2 if you lie with your hand spent towards the left side of your body then suddenly bear his point over strongly towards your right side  if you lie with your hand spent towards your right side then bear his point towards your left side  thereupon gather up your pike with your other hand  thrust him  fly out  if he continues his fight with his point above  you lie with your pike breast high  higher with you hand  point so that you make your thrust at his face or body with your point directly towards his face holding your pike with both your hands on your back hand with your knuckles upwards  your foreward hand with your knuckles downwards  there shaking your pike  falsing at his face with your point as near his face as you may then suddenly make out your thrust single handed at his face  fly out withal which thrust he can hardly break one of 20 by reason that you made your space so narrow upon his guard so that you being first in your action he will still be too late in his defence to defend himself  4 but note while you lie falsing to deceive him look to your legs that he in the mean time toss not up the point of his pike single handed  hurt you therewith in the shins  5 if he lies so with his point up aloft as you do then make your space narrow mounting your point a little  cross his pike with yours  strongly and suddenly cast his point out of the right line  thrust home from the same single or double as you find your best advantage  fly out therewith  or you may run in when you have cast out his point finding both your hands on your staff til you come within 3 quarters of a yard of the head of your pike  stab him through with one hand  with the other keep him from the grip  6 now if he is a man of skill notwithstanding the making of the fault in suffering you to do so yet this help he has as you are coming in he will suddenly draw in his pike point  fly back withal then have you no help but to fly out instantly to the middle of your pike  from thence back to the end  then are you as at the first beginning of your fight you were  7 if you find that he lies far out of the right line with his point or that you can so far indirect the same then cast your pike out of your hands cross over upon the middle of his pike by which means you shall entangle his pike then while he does strive to get his pike at liberty run you in suddenly drawing your dagger  strike or staff at him  8 then if he has the perfection of this fight as well as you he will be ready with his dagger as you are with yours then must you fight it out at the single dagger fight as is shown in the 15th chapter then he that has not the perfection of that fight goes to ruin  9 and here note that in all the course of my teaching of these my brief instructions if both the parties have the full perfection of the true fight then the one will not be able to hurt the other at what perfect weapon soever  10 but if a man that has the perfection of fight shall fight with one that has it not then must that unskillful man go to ruin  the other go free  of the single dagger fight against the like weapon cap 15 1 first know that to this weapon there belongs no wards or grips but against such a one as is foolhardy  will suffer himself to have a full stab in the face or body or hazard the giving of another then against him you may use your left hand in throwing him aside or strike up his heels after you have stabbed him  2 in this dagger fight you must use continual motion so shall he not be able to put you to the close or grip because your continual motion disappoints him of his true place  the more fierce he is in running in the sooner he gains you the place whereby he is wounded  you not anything the rather endangered  3 the manner of handling your continual motion is this keep out of distance  strike or thrust at his hand arm face or body that shall press upon you  if he defends blow or thrust with his dagger make your blow or thrust at his hand  4 if he comes in with his left leg forewards or with the right do you strike at that part as soon as it shall be within reach remembering that you use continual motion in your progression  regression according to your twofold governors  5 although the dagger fight is thought a very dangerous fight by reason of the shortness  singleness thereof yet the fight thereof being handled as is aforesaid is as safe  as defensive as the fight of any other weapon this ends my brief instructions  finis  sundry kinds of play or fight thornborow 1 uncertain variable 2 single 3 guardant  3 different kinds of fight  1 that forces or presses on 2 he that goes back with some blow or thrust 3 he that stands on his wards or passata  all these with an imperfect ward  out of the way  1 against him that presses you naked play is best because he uses his foot the open lofty play the hand  2 the 2nd is best followed with the variable  uncertain handling else should you be a mark to your enemy  too slow in motion  3 the third must be encountered with the guardant play wherein you shall try him at the backsword61 or how can escape the parting blow or thrust  when you gather keep your place  space equal  only be a patient  remember your guardant play bringing you safely in  keeping your enemy out  know this order of play else you best may be deceived to be used against all these differences  bring the goodness thereof in suspicion for all these pays are good in their kind time  occasion offered by diversity of play but not one of them to be continually used  played upon as perfection against every assault  1 in the naked play you must set your self upright with your feet in a small space observing the place of your hand where you may strike or thrust most quickly  readily  so take the time of him that presses on using the time of his feet with your blow or thrust where he is most open  1 in the variable play you drive him to his shifts changing yourself into sundry kinds of blows thrusts  lyings which you must not stay upon  2 seeking to cross him still in his playing as you may whereby you shall force him to fly or else to stand to the proof of his backsword play  3 the guardant play is to be used against the blow thrust or passata that comes within danger of hurt for treading that right way  keeping your place  hand in space  strength you cannot loose time to defend from either of these offers  these judged of in reason  known by some practice will make you deal safely against all sorts skillful or unskillful so that fear of anger hinders not your knowledge  of times 1 the time of the hand foot hand  foot foot  hand naught  of place space strength  time 1 the time of the hand is when you strike from a ward or stand in place to strike 2 the time of the foot is when you step forward to strike or when you gather towards your own right side  3 the time of the hand  foot is when you tread your ground in course to strike rather that pressing forwards or when you slide back or go back your hand  foot being then of equal agility  4 the time of the foot  hand is when you handle your guardant play using then a slow motion in both  there is but 1 good way to gather upon your enemy guardant all other are dangerous  subject to the blows on the head or thrust on the body  for no way can ward both but as aforesaid  your hand  feet in good play must go together whether it is in quick or in slow motion  in gathering forewards or towards your right side your hand falls from your place space time  strength  so falls out the loss of time  when you gather  suffer that govern your fight defend only when you do be single or not fixed towards any single lying but also the quickness of your hand in its proper place carried  in breaking the thrust when you lie aloft single or guardant  space your arm somewhat bowing in warding the blow have respect to your place of hand  strength your arm

dispositions of the placed displaced handlings  slow foot  swift hand  quick foot  slow hand tread  stride  follow  fallaway  when you seek to offend with blow or thrust your place of the hand is lost the way to redeem it is to slide back under your lofty ward as aforesaid always that your adversary lie aloft ready to strike or thrust or use his hand only  if you would offend him that lies low upon the thrust when you displace your weapon from aloft you may after your blow at head or arm or nearest place stand  thrust before you go back because he is out of place  space  cannot cross  thereby losses his time to annoy you  you may thrust  retire for a new assault  this is not so sound  in striking or thrusting never hinder your hand with putting forth your foot but keep the place thereof til you have offended with the one only the bending of your body very little foreward any suffice else you loose a double time one in setting forth your foot the other in recovering your lost place of your foot both to the loss of time  your purpose  strike  thrust  ward  break the double offense is in striking  thrusting  the 3 fold defence warding the blow breaking or putting by the thrust flying

arm all with the cross 93re the reading the entertaining of other things thereto adjoining  the lofty naked play is beaten with the ward because of cross space time  to defend the lofty naked single loose play serves to win the time of the low  double play  the bent guardant requires your arm straight high  outside the point towards 93 re ii well the body  foot that way inclined  notes presumably by cyril g r mathey 1 put in his foot ie advance 2 his coming in it must be remembered that in silvers time the lunge was unknown at least to english fencers  the only movements of the feet were passes and traverses which with slips constituted a great part of the defence as well as of the attack passes were either forwards or backwards and the traverses were steps in a lateral direction slips were little short steps either lateral or backwards these movements were also much used in feints of attack  3 to win or gain the place ie to come within striking distance  4 space is the distance which the sword blade has to traverse in changing from one position to another thus from medium to quarte or tierce would be a narrow space while from tierce to septime or from seconde to quarte would be a very wide space  5 a time hit or thrust  6 parry and reposte silver is very careful to emphasize the necessity of flying back ie getting away immediately after an attack whether it be successful or otherwise  7 time hits  thrusts  8 the grip is the seizing of the sword hilt with the left hand  for this purpose a quanto da presa or gripping gauntlet with the palm protected with fine mail was sometimes used  9 to indirect is to either maneuver or force him from the true line or direction  10 a demivolte  11 the guardia alta of marozzo  terza guardia of viggiani  12 a hanging

assisted by a defensive weapon in the other  21 a high prime  22 a direct riposte  23 fly out suggests a lateral movement of the feet but also might mean a backward one  24 a familiar guard is favored among modern austrian saber players  25 a time thrust in quarte at the sword hand  26 a quarte parry followed by reposte or grip  27 a time hit with opposition  28 number will be too greatie will have to make too many steps or passes  29 a variety of guard to be used to prevent fatigue  30 in sword and buckler or sword and dagger fighting strike with the defensive weapon instead of gripping and trip up his heels lonergan 1771  31 the patient agent is the man who stands upon the defensive the agent being the one who attacks  32 the number of his feet will be too great  ie he will have to make too many slips or passes  33 this is exactly the traverse recommended by roworth  34 parries of tierce and of quarte  35 from this it appears that in silvers time the knees were very little bent  36 a time hit or thrust at the arm or upper part  37 forcible pressure in tierce at halfsword  38 recommended also by lonergan 1771  39 beating the sword away with the gantleted left hand  40 an
