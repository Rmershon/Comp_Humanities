chapter one special snowflakes  last one alive lock the door a gravelly voice screamed before its owner leapt into the air and fired at the ground beneath him he soared into the air with a gleeful warcry and smoking boots aiming yet more rockets at distant specks of blue  ngghh red medic ground his teeth in frustration every damned time he followed the berserking soldier into the fight the battlecrazy idiot would forget he was there at some point and abandon him in the middle of contested territory the man was without a doubt effective in a rather crude and bombastic way but he most definitely made medics job a lot harder than it needed to be  soldier res016d various mental problems suggested schizotypal personality if not full schizophrenia slight deafness in the 45khz range due

coverhe needed to find cover medic had no illusions about his ability to survive a oneonone fight against the various trained mercenaries employed by blu he knew he was a valuable member of the red team even though he was no fighter thankfully though dust bowl had no shortage of corridors piles of refuse or just plain old big stones to hide behind  we have lost the control point the enemy has been rewarded additional time a disdainful voice boomed through the poor quality pa system that surrounded the battlefield no matter what happened the administrator as they called her always sounded vaguely disgusted with the mercs who lived killed and died on her command repeatedly  what a place what an insane stupid and pointless war there waswas there yes a shimmer of blue to the left before

that blu spy he didnt even like that hurensohn of a spy who was supposedly on his own side and certainly did not trust his blu counterpart they made his neck tingle with a strange creeping dread he had always had this gut feeling that spy was his most dangerous enemy although he couldnt say why  red spy rey050a no particular health issues of note has undergone extensive reconstructive surgery on

sensitive information works for red in return for the promise of a new identity  mrrddk pyro called giving him a friendly wave but medic swung towards him and squeezed the trigger of his syringe gun peppering that rubber suit with little red needles the rubber shimmered and faded into the form of the skinny blu spy  merde the spy said casually sounding about as annoyed as if there was a queue for the cinema rather than having been punctured with poisonfilled needles he reached for his pistol but before he could fire medic dived for the ground and scrabbled at his belt for his saw it was a crude weapon lacking the style and versatility of the syringe gun but it was certainly simple to use however there was a bang and medics arm spasmed and his fingers lost their grip on the saw as his chest blossomed into warmth he gasped for breath at the impact of the bullet and heard his breath bubble as blood surged up his throat and spilled out of his mouth as red foam he was drowning gasping and struggling to get his breath and he felt his limbs spasm as he sprawled on the sandy ground lung shot dying drowning his chest forced him to take a gurgling unsatisfactory breath how strange it was that the body would continue to strive to stay alive when the mind knew there was no point why not give up and save on futile agony the blue sky filled with bright stars and turned grey then a timeless nothing  there was a crack and medic found himself lying flat on his back staring at a familiar whitetiled ceiling a fluorescent light buzzed and flickering annoyingly  oh man not you again you ok doc a voice with a slightly nasal american accent stated look if ya gonna live here couldnt you at least fix that dumb light  red scout rec012f only known health issues are occasional migraines

only a witness works for red in return for certain large bribes to the boston police department  hmmph medic blinked watering eyes and taking measured deep breaths respawn was a miracle of technology bringing them back from death time and again but it was most certainly not pleasant it was an old joke on the red team that when they died they didnt kick the bucket they filled it it felt like a very brief but terrible hangover complete with dry mouth raging thirst thudding headache and churning stomach there was indeed a covered plastic bucket in the respawn room just in case it was something of a rite of passage once a merc had lost his stomach contents on respawn then he was truly one of the team as sniper had once said the team that pukes together stays together the australian had snickered at his own humour and spy had rolled his eyes sourly at his crudeness  red sniper ren034e one of the more mentally stable mercenaries seems to have chosen to work as an assassin as an adjunct to his original career as a hunter in the australian bush presumably for the money although otherwise healthy has a rare congenital condition that has rendered him immune to the effects of

notice you are in here too scout so presumably you vish to share medic replied sourly standing up and reaching for the pitcher of water that was always present in the respawn room he poured himself a shaky glass and downed it in one gulp before giving scout a narrow smile perhaps you could perch on my shoulders to help considering you couldnt reach ozherwise  scout snorted derisively and ran a hand through his blonde hair i was just getting more ammo numbnuts soyou usin the quickfix today his voice gained a slightly hopeful tone but medic shook his head firmly  nein after zhe incident with the soldier and zhe sawmill i prefer to keep zhat under lock and key not to mention zhe number of times ive been introduced to zhe very hard valls of various buildings due to the misjudgement of demo  red demolitions expert red001n exhibits all the symptoms of shellshock and is a chronic alcoholic sometimes displays suicidal ideation lost one eye in an unfortunate childhood accident highly

legends wanted by the wester ross strathpeffer and lochalsh police force for charges relating to property damage works for red in return for promise of amnesty  oh man that was fuckin hilarious scout gave a snorting snotty laugh that made medic scowl ah cmon it was you screamed like a little girl ehhok you didnt see the funny side i guess he sighed and reached into the resupply cupboard grabbing a handful of shotgun pellets and shoving them into his bag  alert our final control point is being captured the administrators voice sang out the quality in the small room slightly better than it was out in the open air of the main battle field  whaaaaat that is such bullshit there is so way those fuckin blus are getting that point its only just outside stick with me doc lets get em  ja ja im coming medic grumbled standing up and grabbing his medigun the respawn hangover had mostly cleared now and since scout was right in front of him he might as well heal him and build up an bercharge in these control point battles it had to be said that scout if he would stay in range of medic and let him verdammt heal him was very useful this was the last contested area of dust bowl and all red had to do was keep this last point to win the war  scout and medic burst out of the door to the sound of gunfire scout cursed in disgust at the grinning blu scout running circles around the control point and shot a few rounds off with his sawnoff shotgun making their enemy leap back spin in midair and sprint off back into the maze of ochre coloured buildings shooting buckshot back in the rough direction of the point medic ducked hurriedly as ricochets pinged and zapped around the metal scaffolding surrounding the point and then sighed as scout gave a gleeful cry and zoomed off towards the distant splodge of blue medic looked around quickly to see who else he could shadow his healing often made the difference between life and death since his medigun could heal bulletwounds almost instantly the bullets spitting their way out of the skin as the persons body rejected them in disgust but in order to actually heal someone they had to be present control point fights like this were the most entertaining for him since the team tended to keep close together except for scout soldier sniper and spy giving him plenty of chances to heal their various fascinatingly gruesome injuries and keep himself occupied without dying  hey doc there was a metallic clang as engineer hit his sentry it looked up at him beeped and a rocketfilled box popped out of the top of its main body it then beeped again and wiggled like a happy puppy engineer grinned his cheeks wrinkling around the safety goggles that protected his eyes from random shards of metal  red engineer ree042b possesses geniuslevel intelligence and excellent social awareness although generally wellbalanced and friendly can become erratic if hypoglycaemic suffers from type i diabetes mellitus but even with this health

in return for protection from prosecution  guten tag engineer medic said in return he liked the engineer everyone liked the engineer he was that sort of man in many ways he was the de facto leader of their red team simply because he was able to stop them murdering each other on a daily basis one of the best threats on the base was engie wouldnt like it if you did that however medic had found the engineer to be in many ways a kindred spirit and they had spent many nights discussing new plans and ideas for machinery or medical equipment they were both inventors and had done a lot of work on the various technologies that had led to the respawn system engineer was one of the few people he could talk to who didnt develop that familiar politely blank look after a few minutes of conversation with the doctor engineer was probably unaware of it but medic always kept a close eye on him on the battlefield with his relatively poor health it seemed only fair especially since the mans machines could easily make the difference between victory and failure medic considered him the second most valuable member of the team after himself of course  doktor a deep gravelly voice with a thick russian accent called joyously you respawn again was it blu spy again  ja medic turned and gave a fond smile to his dearest friend heavy was both taller and far more muscled than he was an absolute giant of a man in fact he towered over the entire team if they had been allowed to take group photos heavys head would have ended up being cropped out of every single one it was fascinating really and medic had often wondered about the biological reasons for his vast size his confidential medical records made no mention of acromegaly or any similar conditions so presumably it was simply a matter of genetics  red heavy weapons expert reh009h hugely strong and tall but also possesses considerable mechanical knowledge avoidant personality type removes the need to discuss an obviously painful past by personifying objects of importance to him no known health problems but has many small fracture calluses indicative of a violent past is considered   enemy of the people in the ussr works for red in return for officially recognised status as a political refugee  medic pointed the gun at his friend feeling it thrum into action in his hands as it locked onto its target and then retreated around the corner out of sight of the enemy guns there was no sound except for the measured beeping of engineers sentry device and the whirring of heavys poweredup minigun the sentry suddenly swung around and launched a couple of rockets and heavy followed the movement and shot off a quick round of bullets in the same direction and then gave a savage toothy grin at the distant scream medic found himself sharing the same grin the russians cheerful enthusiasm always cheered him up it was oddly infectious seeing someone take such pleasure in their job even if that job was murdering people there was another deep cry from the sky as soldier came soaring from godknows where to land with a metallic clang on the roof above them the burly man leapt off the roof and landed neatly next to heavy  private report  privyet soldier but my name is not report  no i said private dont start that commie crap  and i said privyet too what is problem  heavy gave soldier an innocently blank stare and engineer looked down and grinned at his steelcapped boots medic felt the corners of his mouth twitch too it was often hard to tell with heavy whether he was deliberately appearing teasing someone or genuinely lacking understanding medic suspected that to heavy this was all some sort of complex joke that of course was where those confidential reports on each of his teammates fell short they were dry short psychological and physiological profiles designed to help him as the teams medic do his job on a day to day basis however they lacked subtlety and in some cases such as his own were just plain wrong  red medic rem029b a highly creative individual prone to sudden intuitive leaps in thinking rather than pursuing careful scientific methodology but still seeing himself as a man of science neurotic

they come scout came running back to the point weaving a zig zag pattern to avoid getting shot fuckton o blus headed this way the young man backflipped to land delicately by the soldier and loaded more shells into his shotgun  comin through scuse me doc a tanned hand suddenly pushed medic back firmly but politely and medic held his breath as the smell of fermented apples washed over him demo pointed his grenade launcher and fired sticky bombs in a line in front of the point before retreating to join medic in the corridor he gave the german a grin and waved his sticky bomb launcher his teeth looking very white in his dark face let the others take the damage eh  medic nodded trying to smile and not breathe at the same time  niiir hrrw a quiet voice murmured and pyro the real one this time not a spy appeared from around the corner of the concrete building tipping his head on one side like an inquisitive dog he shuffled into a corner and crouched ready to incinerate anyone who got too close  engineer glanced at his watch only gotta hold this point for nother fifteen minutes and were done wheres the rest of the fellas  right behind you a soft lilting voice called out of midair medic and engineer both started slightly and medic made a small irritated hissing noise  spies gottverdammt missgeburt wertlos fettbacken  gotcha covered mates a voice called from overhead there was a sudden loud bang ha run that one off ya pesky anklebiter roight here they come  medic couldnt see many of his brothersinarms from where he was hidden but he knew they were there and that he could rely on them all they all so much in common they were all outcasts from normal society either by choice or through plain bad luck all of them were hunted or disparaged by those who made the rules to suit themselves  and yet they were each completely unique individuals with their own talents strengths and weaknesses  or were they  why had he thought that medic frowned in puzzlement but the poppop sound of a grenade launcher announced the blu team arriving in full force and there was no more time to think beyond the moment and figure out who to heal next and whom to leave to die and respawn  medic felt his mouth stretch into a wide some would say demented grin  he loved this part  chapter two afore ye go  there was a final loud explosion and the last surviving member of the blu team the soldier expanded into a messy collection of stringy red globules that landed around the team with an unpleasant wet splatting noise scout wrinkled his nose at the smell hed gotten used to you know killing people but that smell when they got turned into giblets ugh it wasnt so bad during the battle fuck it hed smelled much worse but it was after the fights at dinner time when he found himself thinking about how that tasty cooking smelt like exploded pyro that it became a problem the team were now convinced he was jewish since he didnt have the stomach for pork any more he missed bacon damn it  this sucks something meaty hit his cheek and he wiped it off unconsciously and then cleaned his hand on his shirt that one was mine dude what the hell  soldier grinned back at him from under his helmet thats not what was agreed in the rules of engagement son i got that maggot fair and square that makes it eight kills to me six to you  there are only nine blus i kill four how you kill fourteen between you heavy asked curiously  my guess is by lying medic called from around the corner anyvay i vas involved in every single kill vhich gives me nine i vin  five minutes to go fellas engineer said leaning casually on his dispenser and checking the large chunky watch on his wrist and incidently my sentry recorded seven kills there and i doubt the doc healed that  ah but i kept you alive vhile you repaired ze sentry so it counts medics voice replied smugly  i think yer all fibbin cos i nabbed two of them before they even got close a voice said from above their heads  mrrr frmmmfhurrr gurrrt freeee hrrrrrummm pyro commented quietly stroking his flamethrower absently  and i stabbed their engineer and sapped his teleporter a disembodied voice added there was a crackle and the smell of ozone and spy appeared wearing a slightly smug smile to go with his sharp suit he casually tapped some ash from his cigarette and i have no doubt their sniper was nowhere within reach of the battle in any case  oh he totally was that one i did see solly get scout said with a nod he leapt and attacked soldier grabbing the larger mans neck and scrabbling up his back in an attempt to wrestle playfully it was like fwwweeeeee psssssh boom  soldier cackled throatily and grabbing the younger mans arms to throw him off scout was determined to hang on though and eventually soldier resorted to grabbing the back of his shirt and pulling him off bodily to throw him onto the ground but scout rolled and leapt up again with a snorting laugh a huge hand suddenly grabbed him and hauled him into the air  no fighting own side heavy growled at the struggling scout he shoved the soldier back bodily away from the dangling man  hey man we were just shootin the shit and stuff scout explained pulling at the neck of his shirt which threatened to strangle him heavy twizzled the young man in the air and gave him a puzzled look  you do what  ey leave em to it theyre just playin demo said plunking a new set of grenades into his weapon ah reckon it takes whut fifteen minutes to respawn so since we killed all twenty seven o them i dont think theyll be back tae challenge us again dustbowl is ours lads he raised his empty bottle of scrumpy in salute and then took a disappointed sip from it and shrugged  better stay on guard though maybe theres another thirty or forty of them blus waitin in the wings for us engineer said idly clanging his wrench against the dispenser  scout was not only the youngest member of the team but also the newest this was his first battleground while the others had been carted all over the world to fight battles so far he was having a blast he fitted right in and it was great to get a chance to show off his mad skills sure people died and shit but that happened on the streets too so far hed been lucky and not got injured in the gangland turf wars but now he was lucky every damn day even if he died he came back even though it fucking hurt how many of the mclaughlins could say that and these mercs on the team yeah they were all old but they were the real deal solly and demo were anyway they were cool and hed quickly decided they were going to be his friends medic though was this huge nerdy wuss engie was nice but boring and pyro was fucking weird sniper and spy yeah wow they were amazing your real professional hitmen but not easy to get to know hed thought at first that heavy was just this big dumb moron thought with his fists but you didnt survive on the streets without being able to watch and judge people and hed seen that amused gleam in the fat mans eyes yeah his english wasnt great but scout reckoned he was more than just hired muscle maybe he should try to get to know him better too  victory the ladys smug voice suddenly cut through his thoughts  woohoo yeah thats what im talkin about scout said punching the air enthusiastically  good work privates soldier said with a satisfied nod taking his rocket launcher off his shoulder medals all round  an once again im not makin pot metal medals for yall soldier engineer said with a grin he took off his hard hat and rubbed his short fuzz of hair i got better use for scrap metaln that anybody got anythin to eat  da heavy rummaged in a pocket and produced a slightly melted chocolate bar which he gave to engie scout had learnt quickly that it was one of the house rules if engie was hungry you gave him anything you had it was like they expected him to start chewing on their legs if he got a bit peckish maybe they thought he was a zombie like that dumb film that had just come out ah well boom headshot zombie engineer dealt with ha he was so funny  preciate it big guy engineer took the chocolate in a shaky hand and bit into it cautiously  oddly enough even though soldier looked as happy as if he had single handedly won world war ii the others didnt seem too bothered about their win shouldnt they be cheering and getting wasted the old gits seemed to be about as pleased as if theyd just finished their schoolwork satisfied but not well joyful  so what we do now have some big party and get blitzed  vell medic undid one of the straps of his backpack and dropped the medigun to the floor stretching his spine with a disturbing cracking noise i intend to have a shower and zhen dinner und an early night ve vill probably find out vhere ve are to go for our next assignment tonight  man that is total bullshit arent ya gonna celebrate or somethin  snipers head suddenly appeared upside down at the edge of the concrete ceiling sjust another job done mate more money in the bank his face disappeared again and there was a grunt as his long legs appeared and he swung himself down carefully landing and then adjusting his hat long as i get paid im happy  you need to drop that attitude private soldier growled what we do here we do for america  medic snorted and crossed his arms and sniper shrugged yeah you keep tellin yerself that mate  you know it is kinda weird scout said thoughtfully dontcha guys think its weird  whats weird demo asked shrugging off his flak jacket and slapping it over his shoulder grenades clanked together with a toc toc noise  thiseverythin i mean whos heardve a timed war like we knock off at five pm every night like its some sorta job  it is a job spy commented picking at a loose thread on his silk gloves you think i get shot at for fun  medic muttered something in german under his breath and it didnt sound like a compliment  you dont know weird lad demo replied spreading his hands dramatically as his remaining eye widened in awe back in the homeland we  and respawn that shit is crazy scout interrupted not wanting to lose the attention of the team to one of demos halfassed stories but yknow what is the weirdest bit i mean fuckin twisted weird  how many times do ah need to tell you to watch your language son engineer said warningly balling up a silver wrapping and stuffing it in one of his many pockets  wrrr ssss hrrr wrrrd hhrrt pyro asked turning around to face scout with that blank gasmask face  well you you creepy freak scout thought privately but he cleared his throat the blus you know  ah medic gave an eager smile in reply ja ve have all noticed zhat he tapped his curly black hair pointedly ze blu medic has light brown straight hair und is a little taller zhan i but he is german too and looksquite familiar it iz a fascinating zhing really my zheory is zhat zhere are forces at vork similar to convergent evolution certain personalities and sets of experience are optimal for a particular set of tasks und so ja zhey gravitate towards similar roles whether zhese traits are genetic or due to nurture is difficult to ascertain twin studies suggest zhat a surprising amount of our abilities up to ninety percent are not genetic but instead are a result of environmental stimuli zhroughout life vhich happily disproves zhe main tenets of the discipline of eugenics however zhat is all it can be medic frowned suddenly looking at the blank faces around him surely  works for me doc engineer nodded in agreement what he means is that simlar people end up doing simlar jobs  so scout replied slowly youre sayin its like a coincidence that say when red and blu needed fr instance medics and snipers they went to the kentucky derby and picked themselves a few thoroughbreds  wotch it anklebiter sniper said his long face frowning at scouts insult  kentucky derby medic asked his high forehead wrinkling in confusion but demo interrupted him with a laugh slapping the slight young man on his back  heh yer all right laddie you want to celebrate you stick with me an soldier he lowered his voice you ever tried single malt i got a twelve year old in ma room  dude thats sick  nay i mean the water of life demo struck a dramatic pose which was slightly marred by the fact he swayed somewhat inspiring bold john barleycorn what dangers thou canst make us scorn twelve year laphroaig an islay single malt strong smooth an peaty  what the hell is that queer talk about demo soldier asked in bafflement it sounds seditious to me  he means whiskey heavy suddenly said in his deep gravelly voice  wait you know the poetry of our robbie burns demo asked heavy curiously his eye widening in astonishment and sudden respect  heavy shifted awkwardly shrugging his massive shoulders scout noticed medic look over at the big man with a strange little amused smile whiskey is like vodka with taste of fish he stated and then hefted his beloved minigun and plodded off ignoring demo yelling after him  what come back here an say that to me face ye drink summat made of potatoes ya lumberin sassenach  medic gave a short bark of laughter before covering his mouth hurriedly and then shook his head and briskly caught up to walk back into the base besides heavy spy started to hum a little tune that sounded oddly familiar to scout but he couldnt quite place it he was sure hed heard it recently though whatever it was it made sniper give a deep guffawing laugh and grin wickedly at the spy while demo snickered some kind of injoke soldier gave a slight grin and looked from person to person while engineer sighed in resignation  you fellas are really somethin else he picked up his toolbox with a grunt see yall at dinner whos cooking tonight  urrrr hurrrr pyro said clapping his hands together gleefully and nodding  so yer doin chinky food like always scout asked unbelievably the firebug was actually a good cook but tended to do more foreign food than proper stuff still it was always tasty  hrrrddnnnurrsss pyro said after a brief pause he looked unmovingly at scout until the young man shifted nervously  he says its cantonese engineer translated seems thats kinda important to him  howd you do that hardhat  understand pyro engineer shrugged patting the rubbersuited man on the shoulder the man in the suit made an odd burbling noise scout assumed was a giggle youll get the hang of it sooner or later we all do  see you ladies in the mess hall soldier stated before marching back into the complex  right solly right scout nodded and wondered if there was an englishpyro dictionary around here somewhere  chapter three show no fear  dinner turned out to be a mixture of stirfried vegetables mixed with ginger and slivers of chicken as always pyro had taken his portion and vanished into his room to eat it while the rest of the men gathered to wait for the administrator to tell them where they would be shipped to next  heavy looked at his plate despondently before picking out one of the pieces of chicken it was delicious there was no denying it but pyro did not seem to believe that meat was an important part of a meal and heavy liked meat he needed meat he would be hungry again in half an hour he knew it  he missed russian food although he never intended to return to his homeland barring a miracle he missed fish and barley soup fruit kefir strong tea flavoured fresh from the samovar and flavoured with wild berries but especially he missed dill which was used so much to flavour meals back home however he doubted hed ever miss kasha which hed always had for two of the three meals of the day nobody would ever miss that a sharp poke to the ribs interrupted his thoughts  i hope you intend to eat your vegetables medic said giving him a stern glance your diet is far from healzhy  i like meat heavy said in protest but secretly his friends nagging was sort of amusing and heartwarming  no one else on the team would dare to poke heavy in the ribs let alone lecture him on his lifestyle but then hed pondered that was what he liked most about medic his lack of fear most people upon meeting the towering russian would look up give a little gasp and back away without even realising it hed got used to it in a tired sort of a way but when he first met medic the german man had looked at him and given him a tight forced smile and a look that said oh its you you dont interest me and then turned away to fuss with his luggage  hed always loathed cowards he hated the way they went along with anything if it kept them personally out of trouble no matter what harm anybody else got into medic was no coward and the large man found himself intrigued by this brilliant complex and troubled man however he hadnt felt any particular like or dislike for medic until one day when medic had launched into one of his longwinded explanations ofwell actually he hadnt understood much of it the room had fallen into an awkward and baffled silence and when medic finished talking he had looked around at the confused mercs and made that face  the face of someone who never quite fitted in  the face of someone who couldnt help it  the face of someone who hadnt quite given up yet  the face of someone who was other and knew it  the face of someone who was oh so tired of this  the face of someone quite different to him but a kindred spirit all the same  briefly their eyes had met before medic frowned and looked away apparently annoyed at being so transparent he had still tried to avoid heavy for a few weeks after that but the weapons expert had been persistent siberia trained one to be stubborn and also to hate cowards after all they worked together well on the battlefield and had saved each others lives several times over medic liked to talk heavy liked to listen and combined with medic finding that piece of paper he had finally broken down those walls the man had built around himself chyort that had been embarrassing however it had been worth it in the end heavy rubbed the back of his neck thoughtfully and his spine prickled so worth it  vegetables are an important aid to proper digestion medic said earnestly do you vant to  attention the administrators voice suddenly cut through the idle gossip around the table most of the mercenaries just looked up curiously but scout dropped his fork and soldier hurriedly stood up and saluted every muscle taut and disciplined  at your service maam he barked staring straight ahead  congratulations on your victory today the woman continued in a bored dry voice i have instructions for your next posting  whats next fer us then demo asked idly twiddling noodles around his fork  blu has been causing problems in teufort and our previous team there wasunsatisfactory we believe blu has important information there that we wish to examine  so were to capture the intel sniper asked let me guess weve got some intel too and well be keepin it in a bodgy red suitcase not conspicuous at all and weve gotta keep those wankers hands off it  quite the administrator replied her voice gaining a sardonic edge  have you ever thought of to take an idea at random camouflaging the briefcase spy asked sarcastically dropping a silver of carrot from his fork back onto his plate or hiding it  you are paid to fight not to think the woman said disdainfully  ah yes that may be true of heavy soldier scout and sniper spy continued  oi sniper said but without any real anger  and we would all prefer it if medic stopped thinking for a while  ficken sie spy the german man growled glaring venomously at the slender frenchman  tut such language however i do believe you would not wish to have a stupid spy on your side  wenn sie auf unserer seite sind medic muttered stabbing his meal idly with a knife  would you care to repeat that docteur spy said rising from the table to stare threateningly at the doctor medic stood up slowly too glaring steadily back i would be fascinated to know what i have done to earn such mistrust  the transport will arrive for you tomorrow morning at 6am sniper may take his van as per his contract the administrator continued ignoring the argument that is all  sir yes sir soldier replied still standing to granitehard attention  maam sniper murmured in correction placing an elbow on the table idly there was a click and the slight hiss of an active pa system stopped  there was a slight sense of everyone relaxing and nerves winding down a few pegs although spy and medic were still trying to kill each other with their eyes  so road trip scout said suddenly at6am ah crap what kinda time is that  i help you pack doktor heavy said tugging on the angry mans arm come  spy gave a quiet chuckle and started whistling a catchy little tune heavy knew he had heard spy hum it before but as always he couldnt quite place it various people at the table looked down or away from him and medic and he knew they had to be the subject of some sort of joke but he couldnt figure out what medics hands clenched into fists and unclenched again  spah medic stop it right now the pair o you engineer said placing his hands flat on the table one gloved one not why you two have to keep fightin with each other i dont know and i dont care were a team and yall should show a little respect  engineer is right soldier said nodding so fervently his helmet wobbled this is insubordination and you know how we punished that back in the war wed fire a rocketblaster at their lilywhite feet and make em jump forty feet into the air  solly you do that every damn battle demo said slurping the last of the noodles into his mouth he wiped sauce off his chin and then licked his hand clean of every last bit of taste  exactly because i am a man and i have strong boots those insubordinatin bastards were weak flying through the air with their feet on fire you see these boots private theyre made from elephant hide not just any elephant but veteran elephants that had seen fifty years of service in the elephant army before being honourably retired as footwear  you guys crack me up scout said suddenly braying with laughter so you gonna open that bottle of twelve year old whatsit demo leaving party solly youre in right  wouldnt miss it for the world son  long as you treat it with respect demo said more solemn than normal this isnt any old gutrot  itll still get us pissed right  oh aye laddie aye  who else is gonna join us scout asked eagerly  ah reckon i could try it see if it measures up to a good bourbon  demo snorted derisively you just wait truckie youll never go back to your texan pisswater ever again  mgonna turn in for the night sniper said quietly putting his knife and fork down on his empty plate gotta have a clear head for tomorrows drive  i have many things to attend to before the morning spy announced he looked away from medic with a dismissing sniff and tweaked the tips of his gloves and then straightened his tie  comin with me in the mornin mate  if you would have me yes i prefer to avoid the company of the badly hungover spy replied with a nod  no worries  then i will bid you all a good night spy gave a small neat bow and left the room  i better pack medic stated some information zhat may be of use to you my medigun can remove a hangover but only if i intend to use it for zhat purpose und i dont intend to do so if you are ill tomorrow morning you are on your own  eh get that stick outta yer arse and come an drink with us demo replied cheerfully itll do you good  nein danke ze offer is appreciated and for once heavy thought medic didnt sound sarcastic stiff uncomfortable yes but not sarcastic but i have much to do gute nacht  i help you doktor heavy repeated following medic as he left the room  danke medic murmured distractedly as he walked towards his quarters a floorboard creaked loudly under their footfalls there was a distant burst of laughter from the mess hall and the clink of a glass  why do you not like spy  do i have to like everyone i vork vith medic snapped  you hate him is not good for team heavy said its not good for you either he added to himself  i dont hate him medic replied stubbornly there was a moments silence i dont trust him  he is our spy not enemy spy heavy said gently  ja butrrgghh medic rubbed his forehead and adjusted his glasses i am sick of spies zhey always seem to favour me as a target often after i have just healed zhem or even used an ubercharge on zhem it is medics voice dropped in volume to a hiss embarassing  mmm heavy covered his mouth hurriedly with a large hand  are you laughing medic demanded as they walked off down the corridor their footsteps muffled on the splintery wood  nyet  you are laughing you zhink it is funny  i do not think it is funny doktor  zhen why are you laughing  i do not think it is funny i think it is heavy frowned struggling for the word he wanted  hilarious  so help me heavy if you do not shut up right now i shall remove your spine and wrap it around your neck it is not funny the shorter man glared at him but the sides of his mouth twitched and his eyes sparkled  then why is doktor smiling  ach du liebe gott you are impossible  heavy just chuckled and patted his friend affectionately on the shoulder as they walked away  chapter four for the birds  the transport vehicles that took the red team to their new base had been shabby dusty and bumpy red seemed to see nothing wrong with moving their insanely wellpaid and valuable mercenaries in typical army troop trucks with bad suspension no seatbelts and unpadded wooden slat seats after only a few minutes of being thumped and bumped medic felt sure that he would be unable to sit down comfortably for the rest of the day scout soldier and demo had turned up with the predictable hangovers and passed out in a companiable huddle in one corner of the van with scout draped over the legs of the two older men medic had carefully checked that their chests were still rising and falling and then gratefully ignored them gripping tightly to the wooden slatting of the seat not to fall off a particularly fierce bump had almost catapulted him out of the back of the open truck and after that heavy had put his arm around the smaller man and held him tightly medic had tried to pull away from the bigger man in embarrassment at this show of public affection but he was held firmly and eventually fell into a light dose to the noise of pyro playing with a lighter  click shickclick shickclickshick clickshick  at some point he had woken to the sound of engineer singing softly  cause everybodys somebodys fool  everybodys somebodys plaything  and there are no exceptions to the rule  yes everybodys somebodys fool  he had shifted to get comfortable again scratched his nose idly and went back to sleep and dreamt of ribonucleic acids forming long chains and chasing him down a stark white hospital corridor in the nude except for his socks  the bang of the truck door had woken him up with a start and they had all groaned stretched and stumbled to their new home picking rooms and dumping their heavy luggage and cases without bothering to unpack  sniper and spy were already there looking far more refreshed and alert than the dusty and battered mercs who had travelled in the truck and sniper kindly cooked them a decent meal of spaghetti and meatballs he claimed spy helped as well but medic doubted that since spy never did anything selfless for the sake of the team  the meal was quiet for once since everyone was too exhausted to pick a fight or even god forbid make decent and civil conversation medic enjoyed the quiet for once but sniper seemed determined to get people talking  yknow there are some good views from this place lands pretty different from where weve been before  so i have seen spy replied poking idly at his food the skinny frenchman seemed completely incapable of eating any meal in under an hour and yet it is still dusty and too hot  huh this is better ncold front any day of the week sniper said i hate the cold  so how many places have you guys served in scout asked curiously  too many spy muttered carefully picking apart a meatball and leaving a bit of it on one side of his plate  so once were unpacked whos gonna join me on the roof sniper asked brightly  medic looked up from inhaling his food and smiled oh ja ill come  da heavy nodded  hrr pyro said with an eager nod  wait whats on the roof whyre you guys going up there you gonna spy on the blus or something scout said  not exactly spy said with a smirk it isan acquired taste i doubt you would find it interesting i fail to see the fascination myself  i very much doubt you have zhe patience for it scout medic commented with a grin it is acommon hobby ve all happen to share except for spy and engineer  its just not my kinda thing sorry engineer commented waving a fork loaded down with spaghetti  yeah well come on guys dont leave me inna cold what do you all do up there scout asked  sniper told him  you have got to be kidding me scout replied flatly noi meanseriously  the group nodded  no frickin way  later on once the dinner had been cleared away spy and engineer were put on dishwashing duty while the rest of the mercenaries took time out for some rr spending their time on just the sort of hobby one might expect a group of worldweary killers to enjoy the group of reds climbed onto the hot roof of their base just as the light was turning golden and the sun headed towards the horizon the air was still but the sunlight was losing its heat in the late afternoon and the light breeze felt pleasant and refreshing  look over there by second branch of that tree sniper said quietly looking down the scope of his rifle  hey guys you still up there scouts voice drifted up the group on the rooftops  haud ye wheesht demo called back  do what  it means shut ya noise wee laddie  buncha fuckin weirdos  scout can join us heavy replied as quietly as he could is interesting  birdwatching youre kidding right youre not all seriously up there watching birds i keep tellin you guys theres no girls around here quit looking youre just a buncha horny old pervs  over there see savannah sparrow sniper said ignoring his younger teammate and pointing to a tiny brown speck  ja i see it medic replied pointing his binoculars at the distant tree vhat is its taxonomic name  easy mate passerculus sandwichensis  danke medic flipped open his journal and started writing industriously  i like this name heavy said with an amused chuckle  what the hell you really are looking at birds  i can see a yellow one over here yellow and black any eagles here soldier asked eagerly in his gravelly voice  too far from the sea demo replied peering through his telescope hey theres two of the little buggers see nother one to the left  you guys suck i mean really you all suck on ice dontcha want to explore the new base  lerrrrrrl hrrrlww brrd pyro pointed with his gloved hand  ah i see it tiny yellow bird da heavy held his chunky green binoculars in one large hand while he munched on a chocolate bar held in the other is pretty  i just told you i saw it soldier muttered bad temperedly lowering his camouflaged binoculars  lets see sniper muttered swinging his rifle around yeah western meadowlark lots around here so they say  latin name medic asked  uhcant remember begins with an s  zhats no use the doctor replied he swung his own small pair of binoculars around to look over the concrete roof of the blu base separated from their own by a moat of stagnant water covered by a rickety bridge  whyd need the fancy names anyway  to place zhem in zheir correct taxonomy of course he replied distractedly looking over the shimmering concrete  your birds travel alright doc  oh ja zhey need to stay in zheir cage until zhey get used to zhe new place galileo is trying to break out of course he tried to turn a feazher into a lockpick  ha he is clever leetle bird  you know what im gonna find out where you all keep your girly mags and steal them scout called from below i bet sniper has ones about sheep  thats new zealanders anklebiter m an aussie sniper replied calmly stretching his long arms and cracking his neck before resettling minere about kangaroos  dude sick scout stated sniper just chuckled quietly  minere in my trunk underneath my socks laddie help yerself but make sure ye return em an there better not be any stains  medic saw a flash of blue in one of the windows of the enemy base and idly focused his lenses on it ignoring the noisy youngster as best as he could lets have a look at our rivals then before we meet formally  you old guys are so booooring  medic suddenly made an odd strangled noise and his binoculars dropped from his limp fingers mein gott  look over there thats an eagle  thats a cloud solly sniper said tiredly  like youre an expert on meteorology private soldier snapped i bet you dont even know the difference between cumulonimbus and cirrostratus well do you  mrr hrr  doktor what did you see heavy asked curiously  nein nozhing medic said aware he had replied too loudly i could not have seennot possible i musti must zhat is yes i have somezhing of a headache it must be zhe long hot drive i zhall go and rest for a bit he flipped his notebook closed hurriedly trying to hide his shaking hands heavys brow furrowed in suspicion and he looked away guiltily as he stood and walked away  wrrr wrsss hhhrd ahrrd he heard pyro mutter as he took the stairs back down into the base  dont know mate but you know the doc good at his job doesnt always make sense sniper replied his voice getting quieter as medic got farther out of easy earshot  medic ignored them both and headed swiftly for his infirmary eager to make some plans he had a feeling that life at teufort was going to get far too interesting  chapter five pisum sativum in a pod  mission begins in fifteen minutes the disdainful administrators voice rang out the red mercenaries waiting in the resupply room checked their equipment loaded bullets drank scrumpy or smoked a final cigarette or in spys case the first of many  medic shrugged his backpack onto his shoulders carefully untwisting a strap and checking the pressure gauge on the side tank he then trained his medigun onto heavy letting it build up the first ubercharge of the day  do all you ladies know what to do today soldier barked  explore base find intelligence bring it back heavy stated  and dont die spy added tapping the ash from his french cigarette a uniquely spicy aroma filled the air strong and acrid scout coughed slightly at least not too often  anyone else ever think we have bloody weird lives sniper asked  seasier if y drink demo mumbled  frrr mrrkssh urrh hhhrrr ahudda pyro said with a nod  it yall find a good position for my machines make sure you tell me engineer said idly tapping his wrench on his toolbox with a faint tink  woah really man needa dispenser heah need a dispensah heah need a dispenser heah ow hey engineer clipped scouts ear but the young man just ran his hand through his blonde hair and grinned  medic only listened to all this banter with half an ear his thoughts were on the battle ahead and for once he was nervous would he be there and if so how could he get close enough to him to talk without getting shot what if he saw medic first he tapped his foot impatiently too many variables he hated uncertainty  mission begins in five minutes  even though this is our first mission here i want a victory soldier said you maggots will give your best and get that intelligence from those blu bastards or so help me i will have you all on latrine duty  oh please spy said rolling his eyes in disgust and lighting a new cigarette from the stub end of his old one  you smoke too many of zhose medic said eyeing the frenchman balefully  oh docteur i never knew you cared spy replied pressing his longfingered hand to his chest dramatically  i dont but i have to share zhe same air as you  they help me concentrate spy said taking a long drag and blowing a perfect smoke ring at medic  schiee medic blinked and coughed but decided not to pick a fight for once zhere is plenty of recent research zhat shows  i betcha got filthy yellow fingers under those gloves scout said teasingly  whrrrr mrrr pyro asked his voice sounding slightly offended  he means spy nicotine stains not uh engineer stumbled to a halt and pushed his hard hat up off his forehead not that theres anythin wrong  mission begins in one minute  best of luck fellas  we do not need luck we have sasha on our side  go out there and fight for america you sons of bitches  the medigun started to crackle and shudder with its builtup charge in medics hands  you sure that thing is safe scout said looking at the crackling device in the doctors hands  probably medic replied with an idle shrug if i find him i have to invent some method to detain him for further study he may even be willing once i explain the situation to him surely he will share my curiosity not that i need his consent  mission begins in thirty seconds  after all this is for the advancement of science those who worry about ethics too much lose their objectivity  mission begins in ten seconds  we must all be willing to make sacrifices and if its other people who make the sacrifice all the better  five  four  three  two  one  klaxons sounded and the days war started  screamin eagles soldier howled leaping out of the resupply room and running off down a corridor  we stay together as team heavy stated but scout shot past him and leapt down a hole in the floor before the large man could even react  too slow he called back and then gave a braying laugh that echoed weirdly from wherever the young man had ended up  right with ya big fella engineer said picking up his toolbox  heavy demo engineer pyro and medic ran out as a group into the rickety farm building that would form the backdrop of their own personal little war spy cloaked and vanished almost immediately and sniper stayed behind once he found a suitable balcony to shoot from  medic had no more time to consider anything other than tactics and threats he had become so used to this by now that his ears picked up the sound of a distant explosion and he knew it was the blu soldier rocket jumping getting closer to them second by second without consciously thinking about it he felt his mouth stretch into a grin now he got to make those decisions that made life as a medic so exciting if two people were on fire which would he save should he retreat and let a teammate die or follow them and press on into slaughter and carnage who was most valuable on the battlefield at this very moment in the fight and sometimes he even had to decide if he was expendable or not medic fought to win and if his death bought a few seconds so be it hed be back  back in stuttgart before the war when they had lived in the big house with the willow trees and the dovecot his parents had decided that he would be a doctor and he had excelled at it after a fashion anatomy had a strange beauty to it the human form with its exposed veins and nerves spreading like a road map the lever and cantilevers of the musculature the sheer brilliance of its design took his breath away pathology was gruesome but astonishing and the various pathogenic organisms were horrific yet often remarkably clever in their ability to bypass or even subvert the immune system even the humble rhinovirus was a miracle just because something was not nice did not make it any less astonishing he remembered once giving scout one of his pathology books in an attempt to shut the young man up while he realigned his broken tibia  oh my god doc thats disgusting im gonna puke really im gonna blow chunks take it away hey get off i wanna see the next page oh man that is just gross whyd you own these books anyway you sick creep  anyone who claimed they werent horribly fascinated by the morbid world of disease was a filthy liar in medics opinion  however there was a problem with medicine patients medic did not consider himself particularly lacking in compassion but the woes of the sick the dying or the convalescent wore him down they wailed and moaned and sometimes it seemed that their suffering was a constant blue mist that sapped his soul and worse he was expected to have some sort of bedside manner to make them feel better with words  words never set a broken bone words never cured a raging infection words never cut out a tumour  perhaps it was not so surprising that he had gravitated towards trauma surgery where speed was more important than sympathy and wounds had to be stitched and fractures splinted quickly neatly and without fuss in the crowded internment camp on the isle of man there had been many injuries and few distractions and medic had spent him time reading everything related to medicine and biology he could get his hands on even his despised english guards sought him out from time to time for his knowledge and expertise and if it was someone medic personally disliked they might come out of the surgery a littlealtered  knowledge was power and medic liked power  as they charged into the open ground between the two bases as a group medic took position slightly behind everyone else with his medigun flicking between his four teammates he saw a beam of blue light cut through the dusty air and opened his mouth to shout a warning but it was too late there was the echoing crack of a sniper rifle and heavy dropped to the floor soon to be claimed by respawn medic winced at seeing his friend die even though he knew it wasnt permanent he still found it somewhat disturbing watching someone he cared about and admired suffer a violent death  a rocket whined through the air over their head and medic saw the blu soldier and pyro appear from the concrete buildings opposite smoking splinters of wood rained down upon the group as engineer hung back a metallic clanging noise signalled that he was building something  charge me doc demo cried readying his grenade launcher  jawohl medic flipped the switch and a red cocoon of invulnerability surrounded him and demo as they charged across the bridge demo firing grenades with a regular pocpoc noise the oneeyed man started laughing gleefully spit flecking his beard  im goin ta blast ya into thin gruel he cried as the blu soldier exploded into red chunks however the blu pyro had carefully backed off and avoided the spinning red bombs a twisting blue rope of glowing light connected him to  ah yes there he is  the blu pyro suddenly lit up with a glowing blue cocoon identical except in colour to the one surrounding him and demo and charged forward medic could hear the mans muffled laughter as he advanced on the pair and for a moment medic wondered what he thought he would achieve before a violent gust of bittertasting air knocked him off his feet his back slammed into the railing of the bridge and then he toppled over the edge into a pit of lukewarm stinking water  his legs prickled and tingled and refused to work and he flailed desperately with his arms to try and get back to the surface and breathe the pack on his back was heavy though and wanted take him down to rest in the fetid unspeakable mud of the bottom of the pool  oh death by drowning so many chances for new experiences  bubbles forced themselves out of his mouth as he pushed his fingers into the mud trying to push himself back into the light foultasting water filled his mouth but a pair of slender hands suddenly grabbed his arms and pulled him up to gag and splutter in the air  medic spy asked with a mild professional concern an arm clamped around his neck and pulled him up and into a pipe where he sat and coughed until he saw stars his back was blooming into a spiky sharp agony and his legs were so deadened they might as well be missing  warum spy he spluttered but the masked man simply looked at him coolly with a carefully blank face  to prove you wrong docteur he replied before discarding his soggy cigarette and opening his case for a new one he gave the doctor a little neat bow and then cloaked again  medic simply sat in the curved pipe and panted for a while waiting for the ambient vapours from his medigun to mend his broken spine a sudden sharp pain shot straight up from his coccyx into his shoulders and his back made a disturbing creaking noise he hissed and swore at the pain but once it was gone he realised he could move his legs again and he shakily got to his feet holding the cold slimy wall of the tunnel for support  hey doc th fuck are ya doing here shouldnt you be above with the other old dudes there was a splashing as scout leapt delicately into the pipe man you look like death scouts eyes darted around warily and he guiltily approached medic and patted him on the shoulder with the delicacy of a watchmaker setting a cog in place  nein i amfine vhere are ve  i found this wicked bad tunnel get this it leads under the blus base and right to the intel theres this courtyard n shit at the other end but how cool is that  it certainly sounds useful ja  how bout you follow me and we get that intel eh scout punched him on the shoulder and medic gave him an offended and slightly hurt glare you and me eh were a team  vell yes i know he replied in puzzlement  cmon doc scout briefly ran on the spot as hefted his medigun and then shot off down the pipe the sound of his splashing feet disappearing into the distance  dummkopf a large explosion directly overhead made the ground shake and a few drips of water landed on his head with poor offensive capability compared to the rest of the mercenaries he was very vulnerable on his own so he sighed and ran after scout hoping he might catch up or meet another red at some point he had to be fairly careful though for the pipe was lined with some namelessly vile sludge underneath the water and very slippery  there was a cry of pain he recognised as scouts followed by the sound of shotgun fire and he tried to go a little faster without falling into the stinking mess under his feet a cackling hooting laugh answered and medic knew that voice oh yes he broke into a sprint syringe gun at the ready and skidded around a corner into a small concrete bay set slightly higher than the sewer pipe the water around his legs was swirling and red as he stepped over the decapitated body of scout to look at the injured man lying against the wall scout had obviously lost the battle but he had managed to mortally injure his attacker first the blus hand was clutched to a butchered meaty mess of an abdomen and blood dribbled down his chin his damp blue uniform had darkened to more of a lilac colour however his blue eyes were still bright and lucid and as he looked at medic his mouth dropped open in astonishment and his hand dropped its weapon with a clatter  mein gott blu medic gurgled a trickle of blood running from his mouth as he talked  red medic picked up his syringe gun and trained it warningly on his opposite number from the blu team he could entirely understand blu medics surprise he had felt the same thing when he had seen him through his binoculars only yesterday  he had seen many other medics during his time with reliable excavation and demolition some were taller or shorter tanned or pale thinner or fatter or they had blonde or black hair or some different shade of brown all german all similar enough for him to be slightly suspicious this blu medic though  was sind sie was the injured man croaked his voice rising in hysteria fear and pain  from his tightly fitted black boots to his tousled black hair blu medic was his exact double he saw that face every morning when he shaved in the mirror medic did not believe in coincidence doppelgangers or undiscovered identical twins he did however believe in occams razor amazing coincidences did not happen outside of badly written novels and he was deeply suspicious of how this man could have come to exist the final part of his elegant plan slotted into place in his head  ich werde herausfinden knnen sie mir helfen he asked the bleeding man  wie blu asked suspiciously red had already given some thought to this and had come up with the perfect way to capture and restrain his counterpart it was gruesome and unpleasant but necessary like so much of his job after all sacrifices had to be made he got his ubersaw from his belt and leant forward slowly he paused frowning thoughtfully for a moment with an unusual little thrill of guilt  should i do this do i have the right it will be horrible for the blu medic after all  however he looked down at his own face as blu coughed again and a stream of blood dribbled from his nose if he had found me injured he would now be standing over me with the saw i have to find out what is happening i have to do this for all of us he took a deep breath and grabbed at the fine curly hair of the injured man his arm swung down and the mans eyes widened and he struggled feebly  nein nein nein schwein the voice cut off abruptly  red medic held up the neatly severed head and watched the blus eyes start to glaze over he quickly flicked a dial on the medigun and pointed it at the head letting out a tiny stream of gas enough to keep it alive but not enough to heal the head blinked and its eyes darted about in horror and shock if i used the medigun on its highest setting i wonder if i could recreate an entire new person from a living body part it would be interesting to try  as he carefully tucked the silent but living and undoubtedly angry remains of the blu medic into his coat and headed swiftly back to his infirmary a nasty thought occurred to him  maybe someone already had  chapter six deus ex machina  knowledge was power and helen liked power  helen knew that most dreadful thing that any sane woman or man would fear the truth she along with ten other people in the entire world knew the real reason why the gravel wars were being fought it was a stupid hilarious and pathetic war fought with her toy soldiers but without them the idiot mann brothers would drag the world into a endless battle that would leave nothing but ash glass and scorched bones in its wake  some would call her evil but what she did was necessary sometimes the only effective surgeon was a madman with a saw sometimes the best team builder was a selfish narcissist sometimes the only peacekeeper was a powerhungry megalomaniac she flicked a switch with a long curved nail  youve failed she said disdainfully into the microphone putting as much disgust as she could into her voice it wasnt actually that surprising the red team at teufort were new there and still exploring the layout of the battlements however it was important to keep them in the right frame of mind sympathy could affect their performance so it was just as well she didnt feel any  there was a soft cough behind her and she crossed her long legs and idly tapped the ash off her cigarette  youre hovering miss pauling  yes maam ive found out about asituationat teufort  the administrator swung around on her highbacked chair to face the young woman she was slight and rather dowdy in her shapeless violet shirt and slacks her eyes hid behind winged spectacles and she carried a clipboard like a shield helen had often pondered her assistants choice of attire she looked like a typical harried secretary in a typing pool but helen knew that this woman could accurately aim an impressive number of firearms and kill without compunction or guilt when she had to however it seemed she preferred to wield a clipboard rather than an ammo clip and liked correction fluid more than blood perhaps she realised that true power lay in paper not lead  she was an excellent employee in fact and helen was more fond of her than she cared to admit  explain she said her cigarette making idle trails of smoke in the still air  it seems a mistakes been made miss pauling said nervously holding her beloved clipboard close to her chest regarding assignment of the mercenaries to bases the standing order never to assign mercenaries with the same numerical designator to the same base because  yes i know the administrator interrupted she rubbed her brow irritably let me guess we have two running about creating havoc in teufort i suppose we have to terminate the whole wretched hive now  not as such if i may maam miss pauling gestured at the control board and helen nodded and let her assistant flip switches on the security cameras until she bought up a particular scene she felt her eyes widen and the cigarette dropped from her hand onto the hard grey floor  that isdiabolical she said in blank astonishment and very very clever what kind of mind would think up such a thing  a medics miss pauling said with a nod or possibly an engineers  no helen drawled thoughtfully engineers have morals do the others on the base know about it  no none of them blu or red he used a grenade to um conceal the evidence miss pauling replied thats why i didnt order the base wipe protocol weve used in the past it seems the red medic wanted this kept secret and i thought we might get some interesting results from it  entirely correct as always miss pauling helen reached for another cigarette for now lets monitor the situation  yes maam the young woman bobbed respectfully and made to leave  miss pauling  yes maam  its your birthday tomorrow take the day off you will find a strawberry cream cake waiting on your desk for you your favourite i believe  the young woman turned and gave helen a fleeting warm smile thanks mum she turned and left the room her shoes clacking on the hard floor  helen sat for a moment and then sniffed suspiciously her years of chain smoking had dulled her sense of smell a bit but she recognised that bitter spicy scent that filled the air now  i know youre there she stated if you wish to hide you need to stop smoking those stinking gitanes  madame  i presume you heard the conversation  bien sr you wish me to intervene  not yet helen said thoughtfully but monitor them i will do what i can tostall them take whatever action you consider necessary but please remember that i dislike unnecessary damage to company property especially valuable property  they are people not property the voice replied with a slightly rebuking edge  the administrator gave a sour snort that could be debated youve been spending too much time among them remember your job remember what they are and more importantly what they are not  i know madame the voice replied sadly i remember  the living quarters of the blu base with its minimalist lines built of clean and sturdy concrete were the height of architectural fashion but the blu team sometimes looked over wistfully at the splintery wooden barns of the red base yes blu had all the newest inventions such as the latest frontloading washing machine a colour tv and even a temperamental dish washer that carefully laminated a diamondhard layer of cooked food onto any plate put in it but the base was hard and the floor cold even under the cheap and prickly dull green tiles blu had begrudgingly carpeted their living area with even the lights in the red base seemed nicer a warm yellow glow instead of a harsh bright white like theirs  tonight though the team were very glad to be blu all except one member at least but he was busy elsewhere  those sorry sacks of shit didnt know what hit them blu soldier said gleefully raising his halfempty beer bottle and scout good work son damn fine work  i was bookin out there you know it blu scout said enthusiastically punching soldier companionably on the arm we got all the intel every fuckin case today those reds suck  did ye see me blowin up the engineers nest who builds a sentry there stupid wee toymaker demo said with a gargling drunk laugh  they were just inexperienced and dont know the area well theyll get better pyro said but as usual he just got blank looks from everyone in the rec room ugh why do i bother the small room full of people was making him irritable  i would advise against hubris my friends spy commented waving his cigarette around for emphasis he looked sideways and gave pyro a sly wink this is their first battle and they will improve  i agree heavy said his voice deep and rumbling even though they had just finished dinner the huge man was holding a surprisingly daintylooking sandwich it even had an olive on a cocktail stick pinning it together and stopping it falling to bits as that strong jaw took a massive bite today they were leetle babies but they will become men  thats what i just said pyro nodded in frustration he sighed and went back to flicking his lighter and ignoring the conversation around him the little fire leapt and danced and made him feel calmer he had tried adding manganese crystals to the lighter fluid this time and the flame was streaked with a beautiful bright purple he flicked it again and breathed out in relief  being crammed into these barren hard barracks with this many people was a kind of purgatory for him and it often made him feel trapped and even panicky the fire helped it was always there warming and cleansing there was a burst of boisterous laughter and he winced maybe he should just give up again and go back to his empty room with its filtered air and plasticcovered bed where he could strip off his suit and give his tortured lungs some rest he would never make friends here at least there were others who seemed to share his difficulty with people sniper for instance and medic maybe heavy in some ways those three had this slightly sad air about them of someone who had given up on ever fitting in right now everything looked normal and solid but when pyro had one of his flashbacks he could see it surround them like a foggy grey aura of defeat  pyro often wished he was like engineer and good with people in that relaxed effortless way engineer glowed gold from within and little tendrils of light flicked off him and lit up those around him spy was nice too sometimes his aura flashed into a bright jade green with blue sparks it was breathtakingly beautiful spy understood him with the mask on spy was kind  there was a sudden cry of surprise and pyro looked up from his flames  holy shit dude youre bleeding all over everywhere scout said leaping to his feet in surprise what the fuck happened  stupidest thing mate sniper said holding his left palm sheepishly blood dripped through his fingers and spattered onto the cheap carpet i was sharpening my kukri and my bloody hand slipped cut straight through me own palm  looks like yneed the doc there engineer said standing up to look at sniper in concern  thats just the thing i went to the infirmary but medics buggered off cant find im anywhere  soldier suddenly stood up and cracked his knuckles bring me a first aid kit boiling water clean towels and a shot of whiskey pyro were gonna need a hot flame blue hot well whatre you all staring at maggots move  er not that this isnt good of you solly but maybe id better wait until we find medic sniper said backing away  do you want to bleed out or get it infected well do you soldier glared at the lanky australian from under his helmet  it does look bad pyro said if soldier knows first aid he could stitch it now and then medic can sort it out when we find him  i say let soldier have his fun spy said idly not even looking at pyro he gestured with his cigarette the cackling german can fix the mess he makes once we find him i would say this qualifies as an emergency scout can you see if you can find medic  on it the skinny man leapt up and shot out of the room already at full speed as he hit the corridor  now hand me that scrumpy soldier grabbed snipers hand firmly and flicked his palm out demandingly to demo  whaaat yer not havin my gutrot  son hand it over engineer said sternly ahm sure we can get you some more soon enough a mans life is at stake  me life come off it its just a cut  demo grumbled but handed over the brown bottle soldier poured a small amount over his own hands and rubbed them together making the room smell of fermented apples  whatre doing with me best scrumpy demo moaned ahhh i cannae watch  its only a little cut sniper protested feebly soldier roughly unfolded the mans palm ow wotch it wanker  a while later pyro watched soldier working in fascination sniper had cussed the air blue when soldier poured that alcohol onto the wound but after that he had done nothing more than wince and gasp occasionally as the flamesterilised needle pierced his flesh  well solly yer full of surprises i can say that much engineer said shaking his head in amazement  how did you learn that pyro asked  we did not realise you had so many skills spy remarked where did you learn first aid  guys a voice said quietly from the door pyro barely noticed it and it seemed nobody else did either  field surgery private soldier said with a nod tying a knot with his thick and callused fingers every good soldier should know some  hurts like hell but i admit ydid a good job mate sniper said wiping his pale clammy forehead with his unhurt hand  we gotta problem guys were in a fuckton otrouble here  hold this pad in place soldier ordered slapping a piece of thick white cotton roughly onto the assassins hand sniper winced and hissed  easy sniper said in protest  guys scout said quietly again his voice was almost unrecognisable soft and dismayed  dont be such a girl sniper soldier said getting out a role of surgical tape  guys dammit listen to me scout shouted suddenly his voice wavering with emotion its the doc  you found him about time he turned up i havent seen him since this morning he has let the team down badly im gonna make him give me twenty soldier ripped the tape with his teeth and started fastening the pad to snipers hand  yeah i found im scout replied his voice quiet again  whats the matter scout engineer asked in concern somethin wrong with th doc  yeah therewell i found this scout held out a blackened branch it had a slightly rancid sweet smell and branched into five small crooked limbs at one end pyro heard demo gasp quietly and then realised why there were little bits of scorched rubber attached to the stick an arm it was an arm in a blue rubber glove pyro felt sick there were other uh bits too seems he got hit with a grenade somethin explosive anyway and he didnt respawn  the group just stared at the grisly remnant for a moment there was nothing that could be said this went beyond curses and swearing for the blu team their one certainty in this chaotic life had just collapsed into brittle grey dust  respawn had failed and one of their number was dead they were suddenly mortal again and vulnerable  the moment passed and everyone started shouting at once  chapter seven gemini  stop staring at me red medic said wagging a finger admonishingly i know zhis is unpleasant but surely you see it is in your best interests to cooperate  the living remnant of his blu counterpart was sat on a stained towel on a gurney and made a tutting noise one of the few noises he could make without functioning lungs a wisp of red energy connected the head to the large stationary medigun suspended from the ceiling of the infirmary and kept it alive medic had not had a chance to get any further with his plans the day before since soldier had spent the evening first yelling at anybody he could find about their humiliating defeat and then poking into every corner looking for a hand grenade he claimed he had lost medic had ended up locking the head and his medigun in the drugs cabinet to stop soldier finding it no doubt it had been a very dull few hours for the blu medic once soldier had finally turned in for the night he liked to go to bed early thankfully medic had returned to his infirmary his hands shaking with excitement  coo there was a sudden fluttering of wings and galileo landed on the desk next to the irate blu the white dove pecked at his round glasses pulling them off one of his ears and making them slide lopsidedly down his nose coo  ah he likes you red said with a fond smile blu meet galileo galileo meet blu he vill be staying vith us for a bit he carefully leant down and popped the skewed glasses back into place while the head glared murderously at him galileo hopped onto his head and started rearranging his curly hair  now i have somezhing for you i found some records of a blu spy being captured by one of my colleagues at badwater basin he invented zhis fascinating device zhat i found quite easy to replicate and improve red held up a metal collar with various wires tubes an air cylinder and a small battery attached zhis might sting a little  shooing the dove out of the way he picked the head up by its hair and carefully seated it on the metal collar blu made a tutting noise again and then gave a tiny squeak as six tiny crocodile clips extended from the circle of metal and grabbed hold of the soft skin on his neck red watched in satisfaction as a red tube snaked out of the metal as if alive and embedded itself snugly in the blus carotid artery a similar blue tube nudged into the angle of the neck just behind it searching for the jugular vein blu made a soft whining noise as the same thing happened on the other side and then his bloodshot eyes widened in surprise and he suddenly gasped and opened his mouth  sie hurensohn schweinhund ficken sie lassen sie mich gehen arschloch jetz jetz scheissekopf sie sind verrckt  language red said with a disapproving shake of his head but the furious man had not finished yet  tte mich he screamed hoarsely his voice cracking with hysteria his long face going red and his eyes bugging out of their sockets galileo took off and fluttered over to the gurneys pillows to watch warily  spter red replied calmly he did feel somewhat sorry for the head in front of him if it had been him he would have been furious too zhe sooner you cooperate zhe sooner i can get back to zhe normal business of killing blus ja now how do you feel  rgggh blu muttered you vant to know how i feel how do you zhink i feel the mans voice started to rise into a despairing shriek again  any dizziness discomfort headache red asked he paused thoughtfully i suppose nausea is not truly possible vithout an intact alimentary canal  headache blu growled ach du liebe gott galileo had crept closer again and started to preen a strand of fine hair soothingly another white dove fluttered down and landed on the head with a coo  you do have a headache  verpissen sie blu spat furiously galileo bit his ear and he winced  zhat will get you nowhere red said admonishingly zhere is no need for you to be in any avoidable discomfort once i am convinced you are stable i can tell you vhat my plans are zhey vill be to your benefit as vell and vill not involve anyzhing painful or unpleasant just briefly red saw the heads eyes widen with a flash of interest before returning to a disgruntled frown here at least was someone whose emotions he could read like a book he will come around sooner or later he wants to know the truth just as much as i do  my neck is sore blu said abruptly in a more normal voice albeit still slightly hoarse  zhat is easily solved red replied he opened a small drawer on the metal collar and popped a half a white tablet into it acetylsalicylic acid obviously you cant take medicine orally right now dosage adjusted for heh body veight  you cut off my head and give me aspirin to make me feel better blu muttered  ah sarcasm a good sign so are you ready to talk  und if i am not vill you shine a bright light in my eyes and get out zhe red hot pokers blu replied witheringly it vont vork i have a very high pain zhreshold a third dove arrived and started preening the other side of the head blu twitched his head trying to shoo them away  of course not vhat do you take me for some vile torturer red said in disgust  i see little to dizprove my hypothesis blu sniffed disapprovingly  look zhis is for science red said science is not alvays friendly und nice  i know zhat blu snapped irritably but it seems im on zhe wrong side of zhis experiment  vell he paused thoughtfully red couldnt blame him for his bad temper the man was undoubtedly having a bad day let me talk zhen and you can listen zhe first day ve arrived at zhis base ve took some time to go birdvatching it is somezhing of a red tradition  did you see zhe flock of anthus spragueii ve are on zhe migration route  really i zhought ve vere too far south for zhat i expected to see zhem come vinter  a few overvinter here but ve get migratory flocks too  how fascinating i zhall have to record red stopped noticing blu smirking slightly oh ja very clever vhere vas i yes ve vere birdvatching vhen i happened to look over at zhe blu base and i saw you zhrough a vindow red sat down and thoughtfully propped his chin on his hand ve look identical far too similar for it be to a mere coincidence or genetic chance red paused waiting to see if blu would comment the man looked like he was about to speak but stayed silent  i have had a suspicion for some time zhat someone somevhere has been meddling vith cloning technology if respawn exists vhy not cloning red saw blu nod slightly in unconscious agreement but he stayed stubbornly silent or perhaps zhat is not zhe vord doubling zhey doubled us two medics equal and original  i am zhe original zhen blu finally spoke up i can remember everyzhing zhat happened before i joined blu you are just an inferior copy  red just shrugged zhey altered your memory zhen perhaps ve should check if ve remember zhe same zhings  galileo chose that moment to tug hard on blus hair and the heads eyes widened in surprise briefly before settling back into a badtempered frown i presume zhis is some clever interrogation technique to get me to tell you all of blus secrets you expect me to tell you all about my history and how i joined zhem i vill not talk  galileo pasteur and kepler like you red said thoughtfully its like zhey know you also most people would react a lot more negatively to a bird on zheir head galileo is a very intelligent affectionate bird he likes landing on people it makes zhem flinch normally unless zhey have owned birds zhemselves  cooo galileo cried nibbling blus ear affectionately the head blinked  i can only tell you my name rank and serial number vell actually not my name zhat is against regulations  i already know your rank and i zhink i know your name go on zhen tell me your serial number  blm029c blu stated flatly  ohhh now zhat is interesting red said leaping to his feet and pacing in excitement his hands tucked behind his back i am rem029b  blu finally looked intrigued presumably the re refers to red m to medic the numberzhat is a strange coincidence  and ve look the same zhats also a strange coincidence agreed  agreed blu said grudgingly  so vill yougalileo no red waved his hand at the dove that was trying to remove one of the tubes from blus neck he gave blu an apologetic grin birds galileo is a little unusual he got into my australium supplies vonce im not sure how much of it he ate but now he zhinks hes a doctor  blu craned his neck trying to yank it as far away from the curious dove as possible all that he succeeded in doing though was falling over galileo nibbled hopefully at his glasses  gottverdammt blu announced to the bloodstained towel two hands picked him up delicately straightened his glasses and then shood the dove away  hey doc you in there  gottverdammt red hissed now be silent he picked up the head and shoved it hurredly into the drugs cabinet before striding to the doorway and unlocking the white double doors  everyzhing alright engie  oh im fine an dandy ive just got a lil short on insulin so i thought id drop by for a topup  medic breathed a sigh of relief that insulin had to be refrigerated rather than kept with the regular drugs and walked over to the fridge he opened the door and frowned  problem doc  zhere is a sandvich in my fridge and beer there is beer in zhis fridge he sighed i keep telling heavy he vill contaminate my vials if he does zhat if i find any urine samples testing positive for mayonnaise ve shall all know vhy  he gave me one in the fight today engineer said with a grimace think ill go hungry in future  zhat is a very bad idea you know zhat medic found the neatly labelled box of insulin and passed it over zhis is the last of my supplies ill order you some more galileo flew past and medic tried to ignore him as he landed on the floor and waddled over to peck at the drugs cabinet his beak made a metallic plink noise medic tried to make shooing motions with his hands without engineer noticing  so what about this news eh engineer said opening the box and taking out one of the tiny glass vials he reached into the bag he was carrying and got out a plastic packet containing a syringe ripping the packet open plunged the needle into the rubber top of the vial and started to fill the syringe  news there was an annoyed squawk and medic stood up with an angry bird in his hands  youve not heard whoooeee doc its all over the base one of the blus died in the battle today yer actual genuine death you seen the blu base this evenin lit up like a christmas tree it is seems them fellas are panickin and i dont blame em one bit engineer held the syringe up to the light measuringly  it worked i fooled them they wont be looking for him at all he grinned in triumph but quickly forced his expression to look horrified when engineer glanced his way zhats not possible he made himself gasp  seems respawn failed blu have asked for a ceasefire until they can get it all workin again engineer shuddered and then flicked the syringe with a practised hand he switched it to his other hand and carefully swabbed his left arm with a cotton ball its a bad business sure enough  medic was silent for a moment while he tried to figure out what the most innocent response would be do ve know vhich blu it was he asked finally galileo struggled free from his fingers and flew off to perch on a light fitting and glare disdainfully at them  theyre not sayin which tells us who it is for sure engineer flexed the fingers and jabbed the needle into the crook of his arm with a slight wince  how do you mean  cmon doc youre a smart guy they tell us who it is we know their weaknesses right he pushed the plunger down slowly and looked medic straight in the eye so if they dont want us to know its someone who without theyll be much weaker if it was say their scout theyd have problems but still a good chance o winning same if it was their engineer sniper or spy wheres the sharps bin in this place  you sell yourself short my friend medic said sternly he pointed to a corner of the infirmary over zhere zhe red one  huh the one at dustbowl was yellow mighty kind of you to say so doc but you know who the teamd miss most dontcha  medic shook his head and put on a blank face  the medic engineer said placing a hand on the taller mans shoulder now see here their respawn system is kinda tied in to ours there are backups and failsafes but they use the same data stream and power sources andwell im getting technical now so i better stop they say its just how it works but i reckon theyre making sure no one gets it into their heads to try and disable the enemys respawn its a kind of blackmail you could say mutually assured destruction and all that look after yourself doc dont take no unnecessary risks yhear  you zhink i cant respawn too medic stated he saw a white flash out of the corner of his eye galileo was investigating the cabinet again  seems possible thought you better be aware engineer said a tiny bead of blood formed on his arm and he rubbed it idly he shrugged suddenly lets hope it gets sorted soon weve got a few days holiday but i cant say this dont make me pretty jumpy  medic frowned for a moment as he sorted out the texans double negative ja im sure ve vill have plenty to do in the meantime  try not to worry about it too much wont ya  medic put on a brave smile i vonti mean i vill try  there but for the grace of god go i engineer said thoughtfully bad business night doc hope you get some sleep  you too engie  the infirmary fell silent and medic stood thoughtfully for a few moments galileo suddenly flew and scrabbled at the drugs cabinet he looked back and gave medic a beseeching look the dove had obviously decided he had a new friend one that was human but not as stupidly big as medic and the others were  ja ja i vill get him out again he grabbed the key and then froze as he realised something worrying blu medic would have heard engineers news as well  he wouldnt be happy about it  chapter eight just act naturally  the door closed and medic waited for a few minutes and then locked the door and opened the cabinet again the blu medic looked up at him his eyes reddened and his face pale red carefully lifted him out and placed him on his desk galileo cooed with pleasure and hopped up to the head and rubbed his little feathered cheek against him  siesie he stammered  i presume you heard all zhat red shrugged i couldnt have zhem coming and rescuing you  zhey zhink im dead he murmured all gone  red sat down and looked at the head thoughtfully he flexed his fingers feeling this odd need to apologise and explain it was necessary sacrifices have to be made you understand zhat surely  necessary blu muttered trailing into silence  vill zhey miss you  of course vithout a medic zhey will be at a disadvantage on zhe battlefield blu suddenly gave a crackling bark of a laugh until zhey replace me  nein i mean you not a medic friends zhose who company you enjoy off the battlefield  vellzhere is engineer blu said hesitantly ve talk sometimes about recent technological advances  zhats all no one else how long have you vorked for blu  six monzhs  half a year and you have made no friends red said with astonishment he cleared his throat not even zhe blu heavy  i vas late joining zhe team zhey already had formed a complete social network i amvas zhe newcomer blu blinked and sighed before continuing you mentioned heavy zhat great oaf he never stops pestering me i vish hed just leave me alone  red took his glasses off and rubbed his eyes speaking to blu was like talking to himself a couple of years ago which in itself begged a question he had never been very good at making friends either he would talk to people about interesting things and they would listen politely and then try to avoid him in future the embarrassed silences the blank faces and worse the muffled laughter he knew them all so well occasionally someone wellmeaning would give him some unwanted advice just be yourself smile more ask people about themselves just act naturally that was about the most insulting helpful advice there ever had been what they actually meant was be someone else you are miserable company you are selfish you are unnatural he had decided long ago to hell with them all it was better to be alone on your own than alone in a group that despised you  heavy though had apparently decided that was not good enough for whatever reason the large man had chosen to pursue a friendship with the reluctant doctor medic had found it baffling and suspicious what was this man doing was he planning some humiliation he had been politely cold bordering on rude at times but the weapons expert refused to give up medic had decided that the man was surely too stupid to have come up with some complex joke to make fun of him and theorised that he was truly trying to be friendly well he had decided he could continue trying in vain medic had no need of friends all past attempts he had made at friendship had ended up painfully confirming that he was a hopeless case anyway perhaps there it would have ended with heavy finally giving up and leaving medic to his comfortably bleak solitude if he hadnt found the piece of paper it had slipped out of heavys pocket when he had been walking down one of the corridors of cold front medic was far too curious a person not to pick it up heavy later joked that he was so nosy should have been a spymedic had not been amused and then he read it it was written in english in heavys careful round handwriting the simple words somehow cut through his soul his opinion of the weapons expert improved by a mere few magnitudes of power and most importantly they piqued his interest  it had taken him a few days to summon up the courage to give it back to the russian and he had decided to take the simplest approach when they had a moment alone in the mess room  i found zhis the other day he had said getting the crumpled piece of paper out of his pocket i zhink you may have dropped it  heavy took it his brow furrowing in puzzlement as he saw it he took a deep breath and then folded it neatly and put it back in his pocket spasiba  i didnt know you had an interest in poetry medic remarked it is not somezhing i know much about i can see vhy you liked zhat short piece of verse zhough it he paused struggling with the unfamiliar world of literary critique vas powerful it spoke to me is zhe correct phrase i believe who wrote it  i did he replied simply  for a moment medic smiled and was about to laugh but then he noticed heavy looking at him with a steady defiance he stuggled for something to say that would not make the large man punch him in the face im not much of a judge buti zhink you have quite zhe gift  heavy took the piece of paper out of his pocket again smoothed it flat and placed it on the table he frowned at it for a moment and added two tiny extra words  i like reading and it is good way to get better at foreign language it is easier to write than speak it gives me time to get it right i always forget leetle pointless word there i put it in and it sounds better  medic read it again  broken angel  searching for a soul  what will you do when your world burns down  your chains are shattered  yet to them you cling  tortured by hope in the bloodred night  ja i zhink that vorks the little pointless vord is called an article by zhe vay be glad you dont have to learn german ve have six different vays to say the  article is silly word is useless heavy stated smiling slightly medic noticed his large shoulders relaxing somewhat  an article is a silly word medic corrected with a grin  now you make fun of me heavy replied but he smiled hopefully too  so tell me about zhis poem who is it about  mother russia  ah medic said suddenly feeling awkward and out of his depth again he searched for something to say vell you are a man of many talents  now dinner is over i need to go look after sasha heavy said standing up and grabbing the paper again  ja i have to take stock of my medical supplies too medic had paused clearing his throat vhen you have a moment may i have a copy of zhat poem  da doktor the weapons experts face had lit up with a warm smile in which hope rose like a bright sunrise i would like that  after that they had gravitated towards each other spending more and more time together medic liked to talk heavy liked to listen and so they enjoyed each others company as far as medic could tell the large man even liked him which was a strange and slightly disturbing concept he had gained a friend which was good but it came with its own set of problems how did friendship work what was he supposed to do he had delved into the psychological works of maslow lorenz schachter and singer but even they seemed to take it for granted that everyone knew how to do this  just act naturally ha  eventually he had swallowed his pride and done what all the reds did when they had any kind of emotional turmoil gone to engineer medic suspected that man had enough material on the team to live a very comfortable life via blackmail should he ever choose to retire however they all trusted him completely medic had explained his problem over one of engineers horrible watery beers and engineer had simply shrugged  some things you can only learn by doin doc he had patted him on the shoulder with a supportive smile but so far i reckon youre doing just fine  of course later everything got even more complicated and confusing  are you listening to me blu medic suddenly snapped petulantly making red startle out of his daydream his concentration was slipping he must be getting tired  entschuldigung red said absently putting his glasses back on vhere vas i  subjecting me to psychological torture blu said sourly contravening zhe geneva convention  zhat is not my aim at all red replied haughtily zhis is for the good of us all he yawned suddenly its getting late ve can continue in zhe morning vhen you are ready to sleep ask galileo to turn off zhe lights for you the dove in question cooed softly and snuggled into blus neck  turn zhem off now zhere is no need for me to stay awake blu replied softly looking down at the surface he was perched on  ah good night zhen i hope you sleep vell  the head did not reply and red turned away to leave he reached the door and flicked off the lights  red the man suddenly called red looked around to see the head silhouetted against the dim light filtering in from outside the room  ja  you said you vould kill me vhen zhis is over  red swallowed his hand clenching on the doorhandle  promise me you vill promise  he could hear the voice trembling with emotion he quietly pulled the door shut and locked it unable to think of anything to say  he walked down the corridor to his room this deep in the base the rickety wooden buildings of the battlements gave way to more modern concrete and cheap chipboard the floor of the living quarters outside the infirmary were carpeted with itchy cheap carpet tiles in a colour medic privately thought of as diseased spleen it serviced he supposed  the base was silent at this time of night with most of the mercs retired to their room his was so tired his eyes were sore but his mind was whirling thinking back to the head sitting on its own in the dark back there in the stark whitetiled room alone uncared for  i had to do it he told himself fiercely i need to know what is going on this was the only way  was it or was it simply the easiest way for him at least medic chewed his bottom lip trying to process these unusual thoughts it made him feel like he had churning black mud in his guts and there was some creeping sickness taking him over  sacrifices have to be made he told himself firmly yet again if your theory is correct he would have done the same it was merely a matter of opportunity the base was so quiet he could even hear his footsteps padding along on the carpet he turned the corner and entered the dormitory section with its neat little rooms one for each merc  there was a brief whiff of acrid spicy cigarette smoke  spy he whirled around glaring up and down the corridor and reached for a bonesaw that wasnt there but there was no sign of the shimmering air that signalled a cloaked spy he breathed out slowly trembling and willing his pounding heart to slow down damned spy i hate that man this was no good he was so on edge hed never sleep and yet he was exhausted he sighed in resignation and headed for one of the doors in the sleeping quarters it was not his own and it was unlocked he turned the handle feeling sick with guilt the first time that he had done this had been that last drunken night at cold front the one with the chilli vodka chilli vodka such a vile drink stung going down and also when leaving from whichever orifice it chose to exit and every time he vowed he would not do it again it was wrong it was confusing if anybody ever found outhed slash his wrists happily  every time he knew he was lying to himself he pushed the door open and entered the stuffy darkness stripping off his waistcoat boots and trousers as he did so  mikhail he called softly  gustav there was an answering murmur and a quiet yawn it was the only times they used each others real names it was a sort of code for the unspoken undiscussed unthinkable dirty little secret of two lonely men far from home  just act naturally  he padded across the neat little room the coarse carpet tickling his bare feet and carefully slipped under the covers next to the larger man callused fingers explored up under his shirt and he sighed and relaxed into the warm embrace trembling again but with something other than anxiety this time  chapter nine what you are in the dark  blu engineer removed his goggles and rubbed his eyes tiredly he was about ready to fall over but he refused to give up this was a matter of life and death literally  the panelling of the respawn bank had been easy to remove but he had really gotten no farther even though he had helped build the damn thing the teleportation scanning and assessment parts at least in a way it was a good thing since it had to be tamperproof as a system with lots of failsafes and fallbacks in case something went wrong now and again as he had worked through the system he had smelt those stinking cigarettes of spys which just made him more irritable if he is gonna stay and watch he could at least offer to help  engineer took his hard hat off and scratched his head in bafflement the problem right now was that there were nine lights steadily shining from the nine cabinets hidden deep within the bowels of the blu base although the various dials showed that something was wrong with medic the darn machine was convinced he was still alive this has to be some sort of glitch  engineer it is time for you to take break blu heavy suddenly said plodding down the cold concrete steps behind him  wait theres just one last thing i wanna try engineer mumbled putting his goggles back on  if you are not quick i pick you up and take you away heavy said warningly  one minute big fella there was the total reset switch of course but engineer was loath to touch that hed need the correct security punch card from the bosses and itd wipe all their data and require a complete reentry he had already tried a falsespawn restart and connecting his pda to the bank had not given him any useful data he crossed a couple of jacks to try and trigger diagnostic mode but the machine refused to budge he sat down with a sigh and a large hand suddenly passed a sandwich on a plate to him it even had a neatly folded napkin underneath it he nodded in thanks and bit into it chewing slowly and thoughtfully  so what is news heavy asked curiously  nothin only thing i can get from the damn machine is that it thinks medic is still alive he looked at the sandwich suspiciously it had an unpleasant fishy edge to its taste for some reason but he was too hungry to care its still keepin track ofof the bits far as i can tell it just wont reassemble him until he registers as dead  sowe might get him back heavy asked staring hopefully at the bank of computers  wish it was that simple theres a whole ton o security on these things i need an override code its a little white card with holes in certain places that can force a respawn  i can make you a bit of paper with holes in it no problem scout said strolling down the stairs to join them did i hear you say you think you can bring th doc back wow thats some scifi shit right there last i saw he was in the freezer in bags right next to the peas  show some respect for the dead boy engineer snapped rounding on scout with his wrench  woah woah slow down truckie i was just trying to lighten the atmosphere yknow i want to get medic back as much as anybody i miss the sick old bastard  watch your mouth scout engineer said wagging a trembling finger warningly  finish your sandwich heavy said firmly engineer nodded and took another bite  so what do you need these cards for  its not just any card its a security code thatd give me access to a special mode where i can force respawn to recreate him ill have to order it from hq and it might take days to get here he paused for a grimace and scratched his unshaven chin problem is if hes not respawning cos the datas corrupted well  what would happen heavy asked  put it this way you ever seen steak come out of a mincing machine  dude sick  i dont want that happenin to medic engineer said firmly so im gonna check an recheck that nothing else needs fixin in that goshdarn machine before we try  not now though scout replied equally firmly you look wasted truckie go to bed  leetle scout is right heavy said with a nod tired men fix nothing  engineer hefted his wrench onto his shoulder no way i can sleep tonight not with all this goin on  just go and get a coupla sleeping pills from scout stopped suddenly and for once in his life looked embarrassed ah shit  the machine will wait until morning heavy said grabbing the back of engineers collar and hauling him gently but firmly away from the computer bank it is days before little white card will come so is time for sleep or do i have to hit you over head to make you rest  engineer chuckled weakly at that maybe ill go and borrow some rutgot from demo rutgot sheesh i am tired i guess  that stuffs poison when youre tired engie scout said i got some beer how bout we crack open a few  engineer sighed sure thing im outta gas anyway  report private soldier said marching down to join them pyro plodded down behind him  niiir hrrw  hey solly engie thinks we might get the doc back can you believe it scout leapt up enthusiastically he says hes sorta stuck in the machine  hmm soldier muttered thoughtfully rubbing his stubbled jaw with an audible rasping noise i thought he was stuck in the freezer  so whats the news sniper padded silently down to join them holding his injured hand carefully  dont any of you fellas sleep around here engineer asked  demo passed out about an hour ago he is still breathing i checked spy uncloaked next to sniper i suspect the rest of us are having difficulties sleeping so what is the verdict  engineer explained once again trying not to sound irritable his head was pounding and even though his mind was racing and full of possible diagnostic algorithms he had to admit he was done for the night  hnn spy paused thoughtfully i will choose to be cautiously optimistic  that hes dead or that hes alive sniper asked sourly  you wound me i hope he lives of course  thought you hated his guts scout said  he has been continually and openly antagonistic towards me since he joined our team spy said with a disdainful sniff but acting like un petit trouduc towards me does not warrant a death sentence  cmon engie lets grab some beers you guys can bring yer own though youre not having all my stash scout said leaping away up the stairs  the group headed back upstairs to the mess hall and sat down with a sigh engineer took his helmet off and plonked it on the table while scout fussed about fixing him a beer the other mercs wandered off and reappeared with more beers and a few assorted snacks  sniper frowned at the beer he was trying to open onehanded but without leverage all he could do with the bottle opener was make the bottle scoot across the table until spy held it for him  so engineer said raising his bottle to absent friends  the seven men raised their bottles and clinked them together  godspeed you magnificent bastard  crrrrmm hrrrrmm mrrrddhhhrnk  team needs doktor  cheers mate  next time youre buyin doc  spy just quietly took a sip and then grimaced at the taste  hows the hand soldier asked putting his bottle down after gulping half of it in one go  salright sniper said flexing it and then wincing cept when i do that  good thing you hurt it really scout said sniper gave him an icy glare through his aviators no wait if ya hadnt i wouldnt have gone looking for im and we might not even know he was dead i mean he kept to himself nshit even missing dinner often imagine if wed started the fight tomorrow morning and then someone had looked around and said fuck wheres the doc wed have been screwed  he liked his own company thats not a crime sniper commented  we did not try hard enough to make him our friend heavy suddenly said his low voice even deeper than usual with anger and frustration not good enough  you all sound like a bunch of hippies soldier sneered the doctor was a man he didnt need friends and all that soft shit  you sayin were not your friends solly engineer murmured heading resting on the table his eyes were half closed but his hand still clasped the bottle firmly  nossir youre all my brothersinarms its a bond of blood weve fought together  and occasionally fought an enemy instead spy added curled around his bottle in a private world of his own pyro poked him with a gloved finger his other hand clutching his unopened bottle  and that makes us comrades in a noncommie military sense of course  hnn heavy grunted  soldier stood up and shook his bottle at them all his eyes wide and passionate under their helmet there isnt a single one of you sorry maggots i wouldnt take a bullet for you hear  how touching spy commented drily  fuck it scout said slamming his hands on the table ifno when we get him back im gonna make sure he knows hes part of the team were gonna throw the biggest party for him and get all his favourite stuff  you make me proud son soldier said raising his bottle and draining it dry  what does he like anyway sniper asked  human kidneys spy muttered pyro slapped him around the back of his head and the frenchman spilt his bottle  there was a guilty silence broken only by the soft snoring of engineer  he is difficult man to know heavy said at last knotting his large fingers together on the table i should have tried harder  shit scout said with a sigh he was with us half a year and only heavy even bothered guys saved our lives more often than i can count there was this one time when i was collecting the intel and he saw a spy after me you know what he did he threw his boot at the spy to distract him his fucking boot got backstabbed for his trouble but we got the intelligence we suck we really suck he doesnt deserve us we gotta get him back we owe it to him  blu medic looked out at the darkness of the night time infirmary his eyesight had adjusted somewhat and he could make out grainy grey shapes of the various pieces of familiar equipment oxygen bottles cardiograph drip stand  he knew he should feel scared even terrified but all he could really dredge up was a feeling of bleak despair of course no adrenal glands possibly some fragments of thyroid but even if it was producing thyroxin there isnt much for it to act upon no heart to beat fast no palms to sweat no stomach to churn  thank heaven for small mercies somehow he didnt feel very thankful right now he had had hopes and fears for the future as everyone did but this was not an ending he could have imagined in his darkest nightmares he was trapped in a madmans lair and maimed beyond any chance of recovery the only thing he could look forward to was red getting bored of his experiments switching off his life support and letting him drift off to whatever afterlife awaited unrepentant agnostic sinners like him  and nobody would give a single solitary damn  he had wondered if his team would try and rescue him but after hearing that conversation it was obvious that there was no hope of that red had been diabolically clever blowing up his well alright his corpse beyond any chance of recognition the only blu team member who could have methodically picked through the remains and realised there were no skull fragments or tissue from the brain washimself and he was otherwise engaged right now  he frowned trying to figure out what course of action the blus would have taken presumably they had realised he was missing at some point searched the facility and found his body or what remained of it engineer would have then gone and checked respawn hmm how would respawn have reacted to his condition he had been involved in the technology involved in pointofdeath detection and postmortem reconstruction and he guessed it would either stubbornly register him as still alive or simply suffer a logical breakdown  either way with the physical evidence of his grisly and very permanent death they would no doubt reset the system perform a full diagnostic stripdown rebuild and reenter the data for the remaining eight mercenaries and hire a new medic it was the most logical efficient course of action one medic was pretty much like another after all it also meant he was doomed  huh he would probably be the first person in existence to miss his own funeral  he was so tired his eyes wouldnt focus properly and yet he couldnt sleep was that another effect of his current condition as far as he knew there had been no studies done on the effects of decapitation on the sleep cycle he suspected that it would be difficult getting funding to research such an area and even more difficult getting verifiable results he found himself imagining a freshfaced graduate student standing around in a splattered lab coat and asking their freshlyguillotined patient if he was sleeping or merely dead he gave a weak chuckle that sounded broken and desperate even to his own ears  the worst part was that he couldnt even find it in himself to hate the red medic over and over again he had asked himself what he would have done if he had found red injured and helpless not the head thing since he had no idea where that technology had come from hmm he would have tried to restrain red somehow anaesthetic dart strap him to a gurney and hide him in one of the many unused rooms of the blu base  he didnt exactly feel like he had the moral highground here  he had always told himself that sacrifices were necessary for science to progress however those sacrifices suddenly felt a lot bigger when he was the one having to make them the man of science had become the lab rat and didnt like it one bit he found himself thinking back to some of his lessthanwilling patients and pondered what had gone through their minds at the time he closed his eyes wondering if he would ever sleep again  so cloning was red a clone of him and if so why were all the medics clones of him tweaked just enough to avoid suspicion now by some stupid administrative error two identical medics had met he began to see why red had been so secretive  how far and how deep did this rabbithole go  he sniffed suddenly had he smelt cigarette smoke he opened his eyes and looked around suspiciously but there was no shimmering of red or blu spys cloak he would almost welcome spy right now it would be nice to think someone knew he existed he closed his eyes again galileo roused his feathers with a brrrr noise and then snuggled up against his chin warm and soft  blu medics head drooped and he finally fell asleep and dreamt of ribonucleic acids forming long chains and chasing him down a stark white hospital corridor in the nude except for his socks  chapter ten dangerous games  the trouble with being a solver of practical problems blu engineer mused was that everyone expected you to solve all of their problems all night and all day he didnt mind not really since he liked to be needed and it was sure great to be able to help but a little more spare time and less responsibility would be nice occasionally especially since everyone took it for granted that he should be the one to speak toher  although the administrators pa system and microphones were scattered throughout the base and battlements if you wanted to contact her rather than viceversa you had to go into the comms room signal through and wait for a reply that may or may not come  the room was cavernous and poorly lit dug deeply into the ground underneath the concrete bunkers of the base it was cold and the air was dusty and made his nose tickle pyro refused to ever set foot in there for some reason just shaking his head solemnly if anyone suggested it engineer stifled a yawn as he walked over to the central bank of data terminals and its microphone he didnt even remember going to bed last night but he had woken up with his morning with his mind racing his stomach queasy and his body still aching with tiredness  he cleared his throat and pressed the red button maam whenever youre ready ive got some news on the respawn failure  he sat down in a cheap plastic chair and sipped his orange juice while he waited for a reply since the administrator never seemed to stop working he suspected that keeping him waiting was some sort of psychological mindgame engineer did not scare easily though and he unfolded a newspaper and started to read huh theyd got the guy that had shot martin luther king it seemed well good engineer felt the whole rights movement and campaigning was a good thing but being from the edge of the deep south it made him squirm a bit he knew hed held opinions that were now considered wrong not out of any deliberate intolerance but just because it was what he had been brought up to think in the last decade or so that had all been swept away and good riddance however he remembered using whites only facilities with nary a thought and had felt very uncomfortable around demo at first feeling a guilt that wasnt truly his and trying desperately not to be accidentally racist somehow demo for his part seemed completely oblivious to his southern accent and what it could have meant i guess growing up in the scottish highlands he didnt learn too much about texan ways he had a brief mental picture of demo standing around in bleak foggy mountains playing the bagpipes and blowing up sheep  engineer report the administrator said in a bored tone of voice  good mornin maam he touched his forehead unconsciously i had a good look at respawn last night and i found some real interestin things he sniffed for a moment there he had smelt nasty acrid cigarette smoke  really she sounded utterly disinterested and engineer cleared his throat  yeah it seems medics respawn process was interrupted and his data is still intact far as i can tell the units just refusin to spit him out  i see what do you intend to do about this  first i want to check the integrity of the data to see if the doc is ok in there im gonna start that today he sighed thats the darnedest thing medic knows a lot more about that side of its workins but well  indeed the woman still sounded bored and engineer swallowed this whole conversation feltoff  so once i check what condition hes in theres one o two actions i can take if hes intact and i pray and hope he is ill initiate a forced respawn otherwise well i guess i have to clear the docs info out of the buffer and do a full reset hell be gone for good he grimaced itd be a dirty bad business for sure but if he cant be saved thats that i cant work magic  well done the administrator sounded patronisingly glutinous stand by for further instructions  the feeling of unease that had been plaguing engineer during this conversation deepened and he felt his heart beating a little faster maam  you were not asked to investigate the cause of the accident but i realise you felt the need to act she replied however a suitable course of action has not been determined yet there are other factors at play here that you are not aware of  areare you sayin you dont want to rescue him engineer spluttered his head was starting to pound thatthat  that had not yet been decided the voice replied smoothly all possible courses of action will be examined at the appropriate time and the most economical and efficient course will be taken red has grudgingly agreed to extend the ceasefire for as long as necessary  ececonomical he gasped his hands grasping the table tightly this is a mans life were talkin about efficiency be damned  your concern is commendable the administrator replied coolly however this is not your responsibility and you will take no further action unless instructed to administrator out  there was a click and the faint hiss of white noise stopped engineer could hear his breath coming in short gasps and his stomach went cold and even sicker he clenched his right fist and realised it had gone numb again hed have to see the doc about  dammit  many of his teammates would have been surprised to see the furious snarl that formed on the mildmannered mans lips as he turned and grabbed the microphone wrenching it out of its socket and sending its wires snapping and pinging he threw it onto the ground and stamped down hard with the metal sole of his safety boots reducing it to a sad pile of crushed metal and plastic he then took a deep breath and tried to make himself be calm after a few minutes he had almost succeeded and glumly climbed the stairs up into the blu living quarters now he had to tell the others the bad news they would not take it well he was sure  he heard the tinkling of cutlery and the braying laughter of scout coming from the mess hall so he headed that way with a deep sigh and pushed open the heavy fire door that led to their eating area  and so i checked to see if my blasts had scared the monster intae my cunning trap and guess what i found  go on soldier said with an eager nod he was wearing his pyjamas but still had his helmet sliding down over his eyes  i had found summat much more rare an valuable demos voice dropped to a dramatic whisper there in one corner of the huge trap was this wee beastie it had bright green scales an beady black eyes its little fat cheeks were stuffed with the haggis id used as bait and it gazed at me wi a timeless malevolence from before the dawn o history it wasthe loch ness hamster  scout snorted and brayed again choking for breath youre so full of shit demo  aye you keep thinking that laddie but one night yell be near a lake and youll hear the gnawing the gnawing of little pointed teeth and the squeaking of its dreaded wheeland then yell find your eyeballsve been taken for nesting material  oh please spy said rolling his eyes now you will tell me that is how you lost your eye  nay not at all demos remaining eye widened dramatically that is a tale of gruesome horror and household chores  didja just say household chores sniper asked reaching over to spys untouched breakfast and skewering a piece of bacon spy gave him a halfhearted glare  dont encourage him spys hand whipped out and grabbed snipers wrist and he carefully plucked the piece of stolen bacon off his fork  hey yall engineer called taking a deep breath and stepping into the room  have you talked to administrator heavy asked is there any news of doktor  yeah he rubbed the back of his neck uncomfortably fellas its not good  wrrt irrrs hrrrnnng pyro asked looking up from an empty plate  what is wrong spy asked briefly glancing at pyro  the administrator doesnt want us to save the doc he stated bleakly i was told to stop fiddlin with respawn and stay well away seemsseems theyre thinkin of wiping him outta the system he swallowed hard trying to ignore the smell of bacon his churning stomach and the foul taste in his throat his head spun they wanna save money  most of the people seated at the table leapt to their feet and started shouting over the top of each other  what the everliving fuck man  i will crush evil woman into tiny bits  i will never leave a man behind never  hrrrrss uh crrrrrp hrrrrrt hrrrrs wrrrr crrrrp  it seems they nae care one bit aboot us to hell wi them all  heartless wankers  well i wish i could say this surprises me spys calm voice cut across the noise but i would be lying  before anyone could react heavys meaty hand had shot across the table and he had grabbed spy by the throat he stood up and effortlessly lifted the struggling and surprised frenchman into the air  careful what you say about doktor heavy growled threateningly glaring at the man dangling from his fist  prrrrtt mrrrr frrnnnnd drrrrn pyro said standing up and pulling hopelessly at the massive russians arm  spy struggled his eyes turning upwards in their sockets as he made a slight whining noise and his thin hands scrabbled at the huge hand clamped around his neck  soldier grabbed heavys other arm and tried to tug at it i will not have fighting in my unit private put him down now  nyet he wants doktor dead doktor is part of team i kill him for what he said  heavy stop engineer took a step towards the furious man but his stomach lurched and he quickly staggered in another direction and reached the sink just in time to vomit noisily and messily he clutched the cold metal edge and heaved until his eyes streamed and the world spun there was a thud and a groan as spy fell to the floor  leetle engineer is sick  yalright truckie sniper asked quietly the tall man coming to his side in concern  malright he muttered forcing himself to breathe slowly and evenly his mouth still tasted of oranges sorry yall dint expect that guess this whole mess was a bit of a shock  sit doon hardhat yere pure done in demo stated pushing a chair towards him the explosives expert stood up and went to rinse out the sink with a slight grimace  spy staggered upright made a strangled croaking noise and then sat down at the table again carefully adjusting his suit all i meant was that the administrators lack of care towards any of us he emphasised carefully glaring coldly at heavy is exactly the behaviour i would have expected from her if you think we are anything but disposable toy soldiers to her you are sadly mistaken i do not agree with this decision naturellement pyro patted spy on the arm in concern and the skinny man shifted slightly in his seat  spy has never liked medic heavy stated menacingly  wrong he never liked me and made that abundantly clear when he first joined us  it aint right engineer said swallowing and clearing his burning throat he still felt shaky and queasy he gritted his teeth in determination and if she thinks im gonna stop just because she says so she can think again im gonna check the data and then well see ive never known a security system i couldnt hotwire sooner or later  aye thats the spirit lad demo went to slap engineer heartily on the back but turned it into a gentle pat at the last minute not wanting the smaller man to throw up again  yeah screw her scout said stabbing the table viciously with a butter knife  you play a dangerous game mon ami spy commented tweaking the fingers of his gloves and getting out his cigarette case has it occurred to you what might happen if the administrator should find out you are fiddling with respawn i would suggest you wait until we have a definite decision from her  im not letting this lie engineer replied stubbornly his stomach flopped over again and he thought back uneasily to that funny tasting sandwich from the night before administrator be damned i wont let them throw a person away like a piece o trash  ill help you however i can soldier said sternly standing up and placing his hands on the table decisively we do not abandon our squad to the enemy  the administrator is our enemy spy asked idly lighting up his third cigarette of the day the stink of strong french cigarettes filled the room  she is now soldier replied baring his large square teeth in a determined grimace  chapter eleven changing perspectives  guten morgen blauenkopf red medic said cheerfully drawing the ragged curtains of the infirmary aside and letting the dusty sunlight in how are you zhis morning  was ist blu mumbled and blinked in the sudden bright light galileo pecked his unshaven chin and stretched a wing do not call me zhat  you must admit it suits you did you sleep vell red asked curiously sitting down in front of the head and steepling his fingers  hrrn not really many odd dreams  ah zhat is interesting i did vonder if lack of a body vould result in more rem zleep  zhat would be logical blu mused his grumpy expression fading for a moment  red looked at the head curiously for a moment the man looked thinner somehow and there were dark shadows under his eyes are you vell you look pale and tired  zhe last day has been razher eventful he remarked sourly perhaps being beheaded and declared dead has left me a little out of zorts  hmm ja red drummed his fingers on the desk for a moment so do you vant to know my plans for today  you are going to tell me no matter vhat  true its testing time red opened a drawer and got out a large syringe holding it up with glee i vish to see how similar ve truly are blood serum tests hair analysis dental imprints ear imprints i vould try fingerprints but heh vell  did you say ear imprints  ah yes zhis is some recent research of mine red replied realising how pleasant it was to have someone on his own wavelength to talk to did you know zhat zhe shape of zhe ear is unique to every individual  truly i vonder vhy zhat is blu paused thoughtfully let me zhinkzhe shape of zhe auricle is designed to give us a sense of vhere a sound comes from by funnelling zounds at differing volumes according to direction if it varies between people zhis means zhat everyone detects distance and direction slightly differently if one accepts zhe optimalist approach to natural selection zhat must be evolutionarily advantageous but i cant see vhy hmm in a group zetting zhe ability of members of the tribal unit to detect differing zhreats vas good for zhe entire group i suppose  but zhe theory of group selection has little proof red argued  true perhaps zhe ability to detect a particular zhreat zhat ozhers miss vould be advantageous to zhe individual  ja zhat could zheoretically red stopped suddenly and looked at blu his fingers shook slightly on the desk and his heart was suddenly beating fast he would still run the tests but he could feel the certainty filling him up deep in his bones this man was him same mind same body same voice same thoughts a perfect copy blus eyes widened with the same realisation as he looked back  this meant he had essentially chopped his own head off and subjected it to this ordeal the man of science had turned himself into the lab rat that black churning sensation in his guts that he had managed to banish last night came back in full  i vant to know who did zhis to us blu said finally i vant to know how and i vant to know vhy  so do i red chewed his lip blauenkopf vill you help me  the head was silent for a moment he frowned his thin lips pressed together before he cleared his throat blood type o rhesus negative zhe universal donor it has come in handy a few times  danke red said softly he looked down at his huge syringe with a feeling of slight disappointment alzhough zhat means i dont get to stab you vizh zhis  blu gave a weak chuckle right on the edge of hearing and spiced with desperation red smiled hopefully it was at least a start  so do i have your permission to take some imprints he asked  blu paused for a second and then gave a small nod galileo cooed enthusiastically and rubbed up against his neck red turned his back on the head and pretended to fiddle with a shelf to hide his sudden confusion since when had he bothered asking patients for permission to perform a procedure it wasnt as if hed not continue just because they said no he realised though that if blu had refused he maybe just maybe would have stopped he pushed his glasses up his nose unconsciously and then rummaged in a cupboard to find his rarelyused dental moulds and alginate powder as he mixed the powder with water to create a gel he was sure that for a brief moment he smelt cigarette smoke but he sniffed the alginate and then shrugged dismissively quickly forgetting all about it  open vide  blu glared at him for a moment before sighing in resignation and opening his mouth red carefully noted the lack of tonsils and the fillings in the lower right sixth and seventh molars he quickly placed the alginate filled mould into the mans mouth before he could object  zhere it vill fully set in a few minutes  ahh  it vill take me some time to analyse zhe results most of zhe day i zhink i dont analyse dental imprints very often und i also need to take my own dental imprint vhich vill be fiddly vould you like zome reading material to keep you occupied  ahh hhaaank hurrrn huhhh haaarrrschs  oh just ask galileo to turn zhe page for you vhen you vish  ahh  he vill understand  urrrr hurrr urruurrhrrr  so he is red sorted through an untidy stack of books that had been sat on top of a gas canister let me see lord of zhe rings zhe catcher in zhe rye pride and prejudice to kill a mockingbird und his eyes widened in horror at the final title and realised the hefty volume by alfred kinsey must have slipped into the collection of novels by mistake he noticed blu raising an eyebrow questioningly at its title sexual behaviour in the human male he swallowed and gave a sickly grin zhat is just some background research  whrruuu huuhhh uuh uuuck hrrrs hrrrm blu asked looking at the various books laid out before him  you sound just like pyro i borrowed zhem from heavyexcept for zhat last one he checked his watch zhe mould vill have set now if i may he carefully removed the bulky imprint from blus mouth and held it up to the light removing his glasses for a better look  zhe heavy he has read zhese blu spluttered but hes  he has a degree in russian literature he likes to read zhat is how he taught himzelf english red replied with an amused smile suddenly feeling like laughing at blus confusion he held a finger to his lips but zhat is just between you and i so vhich vould you like  uh zhe catcher in zhe rye blu stated after a thoughtful pause still looking rather baffled and lost  here he laid out the orange hardback and flipped it open to the first page for the head galileo turn zhe page if he asks ja  coo  red  ja  danke  bonjour madame  report  mostly the situation is progressing well red team remains oblivious to their medics little project he is currently trying various forensic identification techniques the blu medic ismore compliant than i expected i thought he would fight tooth and nail figuratively speaking i wondered if he had been drugged but apparently not  medic is one of the moreunpredictable mercenaries  quite so  and the blu team  ah the situation there is more volatile needless to say they are discomforted by the apparent failing of respawn and if i am to be truthful your discussion with the blu engineer earlier today has not helped they are close to open rebellion and determined to rescue their docteur without your help  my discussion with their engineer was designed to give you extra time to work do you recommend termination then  not yet happily the engineer has been taken ill and is unable to work on subverting respawns security at the moment  your ruthlessness impresses me what poison did you use will it be fatal  non non madame there was a weak forced laugh he has simply developed a nasty little case of food poisoning it was merely a useful coincidence i believe he will recover  unless i decide otherwise the voice said drily  there was a pregnant pause  just so madame the voice replied with just a tiny shade of disapproval  how much longer will you need  that rather depends on them  so it does administrator out  the day passed slowly for blu medic he was finding it oddly hard to concentrate on his book even though the faithful little dove turned the pages as he asked the adolescent brat and his meandering thoughts did little more than irritate him and he felt a certain jealousy towards a young man who had such freedom to make so many choices in his life and to worry about tiny inconsequential little details it made blu feel oddly angry and cheated gottverdammte he had lost his place again the words danced in front of his eyes and he had to concentrate to make them focus  life is a game boy life is a game that one plays according to the rules  yes sir i know it is i know it  game my ass some game if you get on the side where all the hotshots are then its a game all right  ill admit that but if you get on the other side where there arent any hotshots then whats a game about it nothing no game  this was all nonsense blu snarled quietly his lips lifted disdainfully  i tried to read it too red commented bent over a microscope heavy says he zhinks it is a marvellous piece of english literature  nozhing ever seems to happen  i know  it has no plot  i know  it is very hard to follow zhe sentences  i know red shrugged and backed away from the microscope stretching until his spine creaked he rubbed his eyes and put his glasses back on i zhink i got as far as chapter six before giving up he drummed his fingers on the desk looking carefully at blu  have you gathered any more data blu asked red continued looking thoughtfully at him for a moment and then suddenly leapt up and shone a bright light in his left eye stop zhat  red ignored him and tested the right eye too before steepling his hands and staring at the head measuringly how do you feel blauenkopf  blu opened his mouth to give the same sarcastic reply as before pretty healthy for a person who had been decapitated but stopped razher lightheaded cold very tired eyes vont focus  worse zhan zhis morning  ja ich denke  hmm red got up and came back with an overly large red and yellow woolly hat which he carefully placed on blus head better  i must look ridiculous he grumbled however the hat was warm and soothing galileo tugged at the weave forlornly  you do razher red agreed with a smile but does it help  ja i suppose he admitted  gut now to answer your question  i asked a question blu said in puzzlement he cast his memory back trying to remember what he had asked red gave him another long measuring stare  ja he said watching the head carefully you asked if i had made any progress  i did yesi did i remember now  i have not analysed the ear imprints yet but zhe hair samples match dental records almost match my molars are slightly more worn zhan yours vhich means  you must be older zhan i blu said he sighed in resignation closing his eyes you are zhe original i am just zhe copy  ah my friend red took off his glasses rubbed his brow and sighed if only i dont zhink it is zhat simple zhink about our serial numbers 029b and 029c twenty nine ve are both just copies and zhere mayzhere must be many many others  gottverdammte blu looked up at the ceiling the white tiles seemed to blur and waver he felthe felthe didnt know what to feel angry weak cold and dizzy but also so tired mortally tired as if he could just fall asleep and never wake up and if he took that long walk into the night who would miss him  no one not a single solitary person he was just a ghost a completely worthless unperson galileo pecked his nose suddenly and then turned a page in the book a piece of paper obviously used as a bookmark slid out he recognised the blockish writing as heavys but his eyes wouldnt focus enough for him to read it  this was the bleakest minute of his entire life if he had had hands and someone had given him a syringe of potassium cyanide at that moment he would have jabbed it into his jugular with no hesitation at all he closed his eyes slowly ignoring the world wavering and warping around him  i vishi had never started zhis red murmured putting his glasses back on i vill finish zhe final test and zhen remove your life support so you can respawn  blu dragged himself back to the present respawn  ja vonce the collar stops working you vill quickly die and zhen respawn vill catch you  he gave a bitter bark of a laugh that was half a sob you naive wretch you honestly zhink zhat vould vork  yes reds brow furrowed in puzzlement  zhey vill have deleted me from respawn by now blu snarled his voice cracking with emotion if ve are so replaceable vhy vait vhy not just reset zhe system and hire no create a new medic it vould be quicker and cheaper  red gaped silently for a moment his mouth hanging open dumbly in shock butyour team  my team doesnt care blu shrieked in reply  red stood up his long face set with grim determination he clenched his fists on the table vell i do  chapter twelve burnt offerings  wheres the steak whereve they hidden it this time  it was blu soldiers turn to cook and he liked meat so it was steak night he glared at the refrigerator trying to magic some nice steak into existence  alright solly sniper said strolling in and heading for the coffee machine  evening private soldier replied with a nod he lifted up the margarine to see if there was any steak hiding underneath it there wasnt the salad drawer was filled with a stinking brown slime and also had no steak he pulled out a dripping yellow leaf and sniffed it cautiously  only seven for dinner i guess poor engie sniper sat down with a mug and plunked his feet on the table with a sigh were droppin like flies  soldier slammed the fridge door and spun around in shock engineer is dead  nah nah mate sniper raised his bandaged hand reassuringly last i heard he was in the lavvy and bein way noisier than a dead bloke  be careful what you say private youre spreading fear and despondency thats a court marshal offense soldier waved a finger warningly  leave it out sniper said idly sipping his coffee whatre you doin for dinner  i was going to do steak but soldier lowered his voice conspiratorially someone stole the steak  you mean theres no steak sniper said tiredly  because someone stole it soldier said with a triumphant nod  or mebbe we already ate it we had beef last night right sniper took his feet off the table and looked in the fridge with a wrinkled nose huh looks like we shouldve ordered some supplies and cleaned this shitty fridge out no wonder engies chunderin how about the freezer  soldier strode over stiffly to the deep freeze and opened the lid he peered in with a thoughtful grimace theres three frozen chickens in there a bag of peas and medic  casserole then  soldier suddenly whipped around and grabbed the front of snipers shirt hauling him within spitting distance son if youre suggesting we have chicken pea and medic stew for dinner ill be putting you on extra duties the situation is not nearly desperate enough for cannibalism yet you hear not until the beer runs out  get off me you crazy bugger sniper said pushing soldier away and wiping his face soldier however had stopped looking at him and was staring into the freezer something about it tweaked his memories from the war  hmm  solly  yes private  yknow last week when we had that party after the reds leftwe drank all the beer next mornin you cooked chilli for brekkies  and  was it anyone we know  soldier ignored the comment obviously right now he was on mess duty but tomorrow morning he would come back and check to see if he was right and if he was  medic wasnt dead and blu soldier did not leave his men behind  over in the red base on the other side of the stagnant moat the evening meal was far more pleasant spy had cooked that night and he had made some sort of fish stew he calledbeerbase heavy hadnt quite caught the name it wasnt bad but would have been better with some dill in it he dipped his bread into the broth and then ate the soaked crust with relish  medic sat by his side a sliver of rapidly cooling fish on his fork and stared into midair he chewed slowly but heavy doubted he actually had anything in his mouth heavy quietly nudged the man but got no reaction his friend had always tended to go off into daydreams but he had been particularly distracted after the blu medics respawn had failed  in public anyway in private the word desperate sprung to mind and he had the scratch marks to prove it hed have to tactfully ask gustav to cut his nails more often  whats this bit spy scout asked gingerly holding up a morsel on his knife  sea urchin  whaaat those spiky little things grannies keep on their shelves you cant eat those he dropped the bright orange chunk of meat back into the bowl shit this is a tentacle what the fuck spy  if you dont like it you can always make yourself a classic american dish im sure we have plenty of lard salt and tasteless starch on the base spy said acidly before delicately popping a flake of fish into his mouth  sniper gave a deep chuckle you should try bush tucker if you think this is bad scout  oh yeah you told me about that its grubs right you can keep it scout laughed suddenly and ate a random forkful of stew suddenly this fish stew aint so bad i aint eating tentacles though  i think this is tasty demo gobbled his food down if ye can eat haggis ye can eat anythin i say  needs more ketchup soldier said pouring tomato sauce onto his plate  oh please spy said rolling his eyes in exasperation  i say its great to try new things engineer said buttering a piece of bread this is a fine meal youve put on for us spy dont think ive eaten half the things in this before now he stabbed a piece of octopus and ate it with a grin scout made a gagging noise  it was my pleasure spy dabbed his mouth with his napkin and nodded graciously assembling the ingredients took quite some time  there was a clatter as medic still staring at nothing dropped his fork and then blinked in surprise at the noise heavy gave up on being subtle and elbowed him  eat your dinner doktor he said sternly you cannot live on air alone  ja ja zhere is no need to lecture me medic replied guiltily filling his fork heavy glared at him until he swallowed the entire mouthful  spy started whistling that little tune of his again demo and soldier hid their mouths behind their hands and sniper started snorting with smothered laughter heavy looked up with a puzzled frown while medics eyes narrowed in suspicion  fellas thats enough engineer said sternly jokes getting old now  what is joke heavy asked  yeah whats so funny anyhow scout asked curiously i know that tune from somewhere but i dont get it  well spy are you gonna tell them or shall i  spy flourished his hand in a mockery of a bow the floor is yours engineer  engineer took a deep breath and turned to face heavy and medic you dont come to my film evenings so yall missed this great comedy movie that came out earlier this year  ohhh now i get it scout said and started laughing engineer gave him a stern glare and he cleared his throat in embarrassment sorry  it had this catchy lil theme tune to it engineer whistled a few bars of the same tune spy had been humming name of the film was the odd couple its about these two guys who live together  medic made an odd little strangling noise heavy glanced around and saw the colour draining from the mans long face  theyre as diffrent as can be but they kinda fit each other and then  the doctor suddenly stood up throwing down his cutlery with a furious clatter and dashed out of the room  heavy stood up too and pointed a large finger at spy i deal with you later  he turned away from the group and walked off to find medic keeping his footsteps slow and steady he heard the end of the conversation before he went out of earshot  well that was a little bit of an overreaction dont you think spy said  guess he dinnae get the joke medics a strange laddie at times  heavy snarled under his breath and went to find out where medic had run off to his friend had two places he would retreat to if he wanted to be alone his bedroom or the infirmary instinct told him that medic would have hidden in his bedroom this time since it was more private sure enough as he padded along the quiet corridor towards the sleeping quarters he heard thumping and movement from medics room he took a deep breath and pushed the door open fervently wishing his english was better it was so much easier to write than speak but now it was time for a conversation that was long overdue and he just prayed he could find the right words  gustav  the man turned towards him whitefaced wildeyed and clutching a book in his hands the room was even messier than normal with books and clothes scattered across the floor he bared his teeth in an animalistic snarl and launched the book at his heavys head it missed though and hit the opposite wall of the corridor heavy closed the door firmly and walked over to the distraught man grabbing his wrists before he could launch any more missiles he struggled glaring at heavy venomously  geh weg lass mich in ruhe he hissed  stop this heavy told him sternly glaring straight back you are having tantrum like leetle baby  fick dich  heavy did not know any german since learning english was difficult enough as it was but he could guess what that phrase meant you already have he replied levelly  medic stared at him in horror for a moment before collapsing bonelessly so that heavy was suddenly holding him up by his arms he dragged him over to the bed and sat him down firmly and then sat down next to him medic leaned forward and put his head in his shaking hands  how vill i ever face zhem again zhey zhink ve are he trailed to a halt briefly and zhey are right it is sick i am sick  gustav  ah mein gott vhat shall i do und after vhat i found out todayi am dead dead  gustav  i have to leave right now zhis very moment zhey vill never  gustav stop this  zhey vill be disgusted vis us vhy vas i not stronger vhy did i let it happen how could i let zhis happen how how how  gustav stop heavy repeated firmly shaking the panicking mans shoulder calm down listen to me  the man gave a gulping sigh swallowed and turned to look at heavy warily  i have not seen film but odd couple was play first i read that  so  it is about two divorced men who are friends only heavy explained spy was just teasing i break his nose later promise  friends  da just friends  not medics voice trailed to a halt and he waved a shaking hand in the air  nyet  ah mein gott he repeated in miserable dismay burying his face completely in his hands now i must look like a total fool to zhem all  maybe heavy replied with a shrug is not first time  bastard medic punched him in the arm but looked up and smiled sheepishly the colour started to return to his cheeks he gave a long keening sigh and they sat in silence for a few seconds heavy put his arm around him and tried to hold him close but medic struggled and pulled away  nein he said but his hand stayed on heavys arm as if he couldnt quite bring himself to let go  at first i felt it wrong and bad too but i think much about this soviets say it is wrong nazis said it is wrong but it hurt nobody and they hurt many many people i think they are not good judges of right and wrong so i decide to hell with all them  i try not to zhink about itbut vhat does it mean vhat should i do medic looked pleadingly at him begging for an answer that would make sense to that logical mind of his vhat am i  you are gustav i am misha we arewhatever we want to be  medic looked down for a moment peering at the littered carpet as if he was searching for an answer there he glanced up with a frown at the larger man for a moment before examining the floor again finally he looked up determinedly grabbed heavys shoulders and kissed him  chapter thirteen insanity squared  he could hear the waves crashing and the mournful cries of seagulls he felt empty and floated through the frozen white clouds disembodied and lost as cold as the air around him he wanted to call out and find someone but he had no idea who he knew no names not even his own a gull swooped close and he realised it was a white dove but it still cried out with a gulls voice singing terrible words at him  nameless soulless nothing oblivion empty nonentity  he wanted to shout at them to shut up but he had no voice and no body he wanted to lose himself in the frozen clouds and be forgottento sleepjust let me sleep  blauenkopf  the clouds gained sharp edges and turned into squares  nobody  come now vake up my friend now is not zhe time for sleeping  the clouds wavered crisscrossing and weaving in and out of each other he blinked slowly  vhy are zhe squares zhere he asked zhe birds need to shut up zhey stop me zhinking  you vill feel better in a moment  let me sleep he mumbled too cold to be avake  you fell ill last night vhile i vas eh busy im sorry i should have realised vhat vas happening before zhen by zhis morning you vere delirious and feverish  ill the square clouds became shinier and harder retreating away to form a plane hanging in front of him i vant zhe clouds back bring zhem back the comforting cold was leaving too and the world thawed the ice shattered and reality snapped back  the squares were tiles on the infirmary wall opposite there were no doves and only a gentle warmth the red medic was staring at him measuringly he gave a small groan and blinked again  vhat happened  you vere drowning in your own toxins it seems your lifesupport system is not as efficient at purifying blood as human kidneys and livers so and red gave a wide grin and held up his arm i leant you mine two largebore needles lead from reds arm to somewhere below blus stubbled chin one was bright vermillion the other a duller purplered  ah uh danke blu realised he was once again thanking the man who had cut his head off but he is trying to keep you alive even though he has no good reason to he could have just let you diehe said he was going to help  how do you feel now  he frowned briefly trying to perform an internal audit on what body he had left he did feel better than he had yesterday when he had been trying to plough through that novel more alert and not so cold however the revelations of the previous night hit him like a damp brick and clammy depression settled back over him again  better he simply replied  sehr gut the unit can now take over again i vill give you anozher transfusion later today zhis is excellent now i can keep you alive indefinitely red neatly plucked the needles from his own arm and blus neck  blu didnt even bother to comment on that remark you zeem very cheerful zhis morning he said suspiciously considering vhat ve found out last night  ja red replied getting a medigun and backpack out of a cupboard  fine keep your secrets blu muttered blu recognised the medigun as the prototype gun he had later modified and streamlined into the quickfix of course it hadnt been him who had made the medigun he merely carried the memories of the man who had he sighed wondering if he would ever get used to that  now i had an idea during zhe night and i vant to see if it vill vork red said ignoring the remark he placed a towel on the desk and then put a metal tray next to it the tray contained his ubersaw a sterile dressing surgical tape a syringe and needle and a vial of lidocaine  vhat is zhat all for blu asked dubiously eyeing the collection i dont have many body parts left for you to remove  zhis he held up a finger dramatically i said i vould help you and so i vill zhis is the first step to your salvation blauenkopf  vhat  vatch red quickly filled the syringe with the local anaesthetic and carefully inserted the needle into his left hand just below the knuckle and next to his little finger wincing slightly ve vait a few moments until my hand goes numb he wiggled his fingers experimentally and then poked his finger with the needle little beads of blood formed on the skin zhere  red sat down at the desk straightening his glasses and adjusting his shirt sleeves and then he placed his left hand on the towel balling his fingers into a fist except for his pinkie finger he grabbed his ubersaw in the other hand  red blu cried out in horror  and brought it down firmly neatly chopping off his own finger  du bist verrckt blu shouted totally insane  shh the injured man rapidly bound his bleeding hand in a cocoon of fabric and surgical tape and then picked up the severed digit with a satisfied nod now lets see if zhis vorks  he placed the finger back on the towel and picked up the quickfix gun he twisted the gas valve to fully open and then set the charge to maximum he switched it on and the cooling fins started to glow as he aimed it at the bleeding finger he had cut off instead of the normal soft tendril of light the medigun emitted usually a brilliant red arc of light shot out spinning and writhing the backpack shook and rattled its cooling fins glowing first red then white hot the room reeked of burning insulation there was a shriek of tearing metal a flash of blinding light and then a very final bang  and briefly the stink of cigarette smoke  blu blinked trying to clear the green afterimages from his eyes as red hurriedly dropped the scorchinghot remains of the quickfix and sucked his remaining fingers curls of stinking grey smoke hung in the air red bent over to look at the object on the towel and smiled in triumph  it vorked  zhat was a success vhat vould failure have looked like blu asked  ja i broke zhe quickfix but look red picked up the item on the towel and held it reverentially  four fingers and a thumb it was a hand complete and perfect  i need to do some calculations but blu he smiled at the head ill make a man out of you  blu scout checked his watch and skidded around the corner little puffs of dust exploding under his feet as he completed his last lap of the base with the current ceasefire he was getting not just bored but in dire need of exercise so he had taken to having a quick prelunch run to stave off an attack of the fidgets as mom always put it  he jogged in the spot for a moment trying to decide if he was hungry enough for lunch yet or whether to do another lap he stomach chose that moment to rumble so he decided to run back to the base and grab some food he sprinted back to the main door checked his heartbeat and then strolled into the cool corridor of the living quarters heading in the direction of the mess hall  the door to engineers room opened and scout stopped cautiously to make sure he was out of splash distance but the smaller man just stepped out into the corridor yawned and then smiled at scout tiredly  hey hardhat you look like hell howre ya doin  bettern i was he said leaning against the wall and closing his eyes he absently tightened the belt of his dressing gown thought id get some fresh air and remind yall i aint dead yet  wow your breath stinks you could melt steel with it scout said with a grin  engineer chuckled slightly well thatd sure come in handy in my line o work  im just gonna get some food you need anythin  engineer grimaced at the mention of food but nodded some water would be fine im fair thirsty  you know what my mom always gives me when im sick  if youre gonna say chicken soup son the answers no thanks all the same  nah ginger ale stirred until all the bubbles have gone and its totally flat she said the gingers good for the pukes and the sugar and water keep your strength up i could get you some  worth a try engineer said with a shrug he stretched and rubbed his cheeks dag nab it im tired  oh sollys been lookin for you  yeah whats he after  youll never guess scout gave a snorting laugh he says hes actin field medic until we get th doc back and he wanted to give you a checkup  engineers hands slowly left his face and his eyes widened with horror you dont say  i told him you were totally crashed an itd be best not to bother ya scout replied with a grin  well son i was gonna take a look at respawn again but maybe i better hide he said with a weak laugh preciate it scout  hey youre way too sick to get back to work anyhow i bet youd just fuck it up or pass out and wed get back i dunno a medic with three heads or somethin you go back to bed an ill get that ginger ale for ya how bout that  youre a good un son  be right back scout nodded and sped off up the corridor to the mess hall he could hear soldier moving about and muttering to himself in there hey sol have you seen the what the fuck you sick freak  scout ive found out something of vital importance to the team soldier said motioning scout to join him the young man lingered in the doorway ready to run if the burly man came any closer  spread out on the table the table they ate on were medics frozen remains arranged in a roughly human shape soldier held something organic in his hand  what do you think kidney or spleen  for the first time in his life scout was lost for words his mouth gaped open for a few moments before he swallowed uneasily what the hell dude  this is vital to the war effort private soldier said you ever served in an area that was carpet bombed  huh  when performing body counts in the rubble theres a vital rule you must always follow always look for the head hence the term head count he gestured at the sorry fragments of the late doctor  uh  you see it dont you we dont have his head soldier stared intently at scout from under his helmet  yeah well maybe it got exploded into bits or somethin now get the poor sonnavabitch off the table before he melts  a person cannot not be declared dead without the head soldier said triumphantly we dont have medics head so soldiers voice dropped to a dramatic whisper hes still alive  scout stared at soldier for a moment wow even for you thats fuckin nuts  you got a better explanation private  why havent we buried him yet anyway scout asked ignoring soldiers idiotic question  in a questionable case such as this we gotta wait for an autopsy and for that we need a medic  scout snorted with laughter now how about that for a welcome party hey doc heres your room now before you unpack can you cut up the dude who did your job before you what the fuck do you expect him to find anyway  its standard procedure soldier said firmly he rubbed his chin thoughtfully i guess im done here you can help me put him back into storage  hell no scout stated he opened the fridge and grabbed a bottle im just here to get some ginger ale for engie hasnt anyone cleaned out this craphole of a fridge yet  soldier wasnt paying attention though he rubbed his chin thoughtfully hes out there somewhere i know it im not giving up until i find that head  just put him back in the goddamn freezer sol  the docll be back soldier muttered to himself picking up a frozen foot you wait and see  scout just rolled his eyes and silently left skipping lunch today suddenly seemed like a great idea  chapter fourteen violet requiem  galileo was preening blu medics head again and kepler snuggled contentedly under his chin he liked the birds company but they did make him rather itchy and he couldnt do anything about it  next page  galileo waddled over and flipped the page with his beak before returning to his preening   do you feel absolutely no concern for your future boy  oh i feel some concern for my future all right sure sure i do i thought about it for a minute but not too much i guess not too much i guess  you will old spencer said you will boy you will when its too late   blu sniffed in annoyance at the pointless prose and looked over to the red medic who was currently staring into the air and tapping a pencil on the desk any progress  of a sort red cleared his throat and pushed his glasses up his nose  youve not healed your finger yet  i have more important zhings to work on right now red replied sternly waving his bandaged hand idly its not like i need zhat finger much anyway  so vhat have you found  zhat it vill vork but zhere is a little hitch red said showing off a page of calculations zhe strength of electrical current needed to distribute zhe medigun gas effectively is exponentially related vith regards to zhe ratio of tissue needing regeneration to zhe amount of preexisting healzhy tissue  soyou vill need power a lot of power  precisely red smiled warmly at his double he stood up and walked over to the large infirmary medigun and patted its barrel he frowned in thought and altered a few dials turning everything up to maximum and zhe procedure must be completed in one session since ozhervise eh well  quite blu grimaced his imagination working only too well is it possible  ve vill find out red replied with an eager grin he walked behind blu for a second and returned uncoiling a long thick cable which he plugged into the gun  erred blu asked cautiously zhat much current vill melt zhe gun  ja red paused turning away from the head and looking out of the window he folded his arms behind his back in fact it vill short out our entire base possibly blus too he turned back and looked at blu with a solemn unreadable expression  you blu struggled for a moment trying to figure out he wanted to say red vill find out vhat you did  so zhey vill  zhey vill vant to know vhy  ja  you vill be in a lot of trouble blu stated  oh ja  red i dont zhink zhey vill let you live blu said hesitantly whoever is behind zhe cloning zhe wars red and blu all zhis zhey are very powerful and zhey vill kill you  maybe red gave a haunting sad smile  vhy vhy do zhis for me blu asked in a whisper  because red paused running his hand idly over the large medigun his long face settled into an earnest wistfulness he looked up at the shiny white dials and its polished red barrelit is myduty because somevone somevhere has to give a damn because i choose to because i understand now i see you zhere and i know vhat i didto you and many ozhers because i alvays told myself sacrifices had to be made  red  the mans head dropped and he looked at the floor becausei am sorry  you are a better man zhan i blu replied quietly my friend  come now you know zhat is most definitely not true the man looked up with a sudden surreally sunny grin  ithas been an honour red blu said hesitantly im glad ve got to meet  soare you ready to go home  if you arered look out blu suddenly shouted but he was too late far too late and he watched helplessly as the scene played out in adrenalineboosted slow motion  spy uncloaked  red medic turned slightly  hand in silk glove grabbed his mouth  the syringe stabbed down  into his neck  a smothered scream  plunger depressed  red convulsed once  twice  and fell  no blu cried  he watched in horror as the doctor slumped down and landed sprawled sideways on the gurney for a moment blus eyes met those of the dying man red stared desperately at him his mouth opening soundlessly for a moment before the facial muscles relaxed and the stare became glassy and fixed  he dragged his eyes away to look at his friends murderer and realised that this was not the blu spy or even the red spy instead he was dressed in a deep purple so dark it was almost black  he will not respawn the spy commented quietly idly spinning the empty syringe in his hands  who are you blu shrieked his voice raising an octave with shock  i am the spy the man stepped back and gave a flourishing bow still twirling the syringe theatrically the original  vhy vhy  he brought this upon himself with his experiments upon you i could not allow him to continue any further and let the little secret you two have stumbled upon become known to the others he had gone too far i had little choice the violet spy fished a piece of paper out of his pocket and smoothed it flat  and now you vill kill me too i suppose blu asked defiantly  maybe he shrugged but not yet however if you tell anyone what you have discovered you will die and so will they  how many blu croaked weakly  how many of you are there legions  vhat is zhe point ofofall zhis vhy are you doing it  its better if you dont know just keep doing your job docteur if you excelmaybe you will become valuable in the long term think about it  the red team vill be suspicious zhey vill vant to know vhy he died  i have done this many times before the man sighed melancholy for a moment he placed the syringe and the piece of paper next to red blu craned for a look and realised it was in his own handwriting  i cant go on any more  it was my fault  i disabled respawn so i could do this  i am just too tired  i am sorry  medic  vhere did you get zhat note he demanded  oh please the man replied rolling his eyes sardonically think about it  you knowhim  gustav is a good friend of mine spy said getting his cigarette case out he smiled slightly as if something amused him a very good friend he lit one of his acrid french cigarettes idly  i knew i smelt zhose stinking zhings zhey alvays give you avay  spy laughed suddenly ah my dear medic that is precisely why i smoke them now may i give you some advice  vhy vould i vant your advice blu spat  always remember who you are and think about what that means think the man stared down at him eyes narrow and shrewd before standing up and giving a slight cough and now as your late colleague said it is time for you to go home  before medic could say anything more a slender gloved hand reached across dispassionately and yanked the cables out of his life support unit  the world filled with snowflakes and the waves roared the seagulls sang their sad requiem and then there was nothing  blu soldier had no duties to complete right now so he decided the most useful thing he could do was go on patrol nowhere in particular needed guarding but it seemed like it would be good practice anyway you never knew when they might come  he had chosen the corridor by respawn just in case medics head should choose to make an appearance there he had looked all over the base but had not found it since it wasnt there it was obvious what must have happened that bastard red team had stolen it he had tried explaining this to demo but the scotsman had just laughed at him and called him crazy  it was very quiet down here with just the occasional buzz of tape drives and the metallic clicks of the bank of nine respawn machines the front panels were still stacked to one side from engineers earlier work and nine green lights shone and the needles held steady he turned around sharply and marched back in the opposite direction  he wondered how engineer was fairing he would have to find out which of the red mercenaries had poisoned him and make sure he kicked their ass poison was an underhanded dirty commie trick hardhat was an american though hed fight those cheapass foreign chemicals and pull through once the man woke up soldier would have to go and check he wasnt getting dehydrated he had once been shown had to fit an iv saline drip and he was sure he remembered how to do it  beep  soldier spun around peering out from under his helmet to find out the source of the noise his eyes darted around in their sockets searching for a threat a soft whirring noise ascending in tone made him look towards the bank of machines  a red light blinked a dial flicked up to maximum and trembled as if in excitement there was a buzzing crackle and another panel lit up figures and numbers started to scroll in bright blue text on black  soldier stared for a moment and then broke into a run up the concrete stairs skidding sideways onto the carpeted corridors of the living quarters he banged on each door as he passed by  red alert scramble move maggots  ey whats with all the noise laddie  mrr hrrr  report for duty all personel emergency  that is settled then soldier has finally gone completely insane  huh not a big surprise there mate  dammit son you woke me up this better be good  listen to me you sorry sacks of shit soldier stopped and turned back to glare at his baffled brothersinarms he took a deep breath medic is respawning  no way you serious hardhat you rock  me kind of you to say but ive done nothin you know where ive been stuck the last coupla days  we need to help doktor  everyone assemble at the respawn room now move privates  the group pounded along the concrete corridors heading upwards towards the battlements and the respawn room soldier tried to lead but eventually everyone but heavy and engineer overtook him  doc he heard scout call damn medic where the fuck have you been  hes back hes back bloody hell its good to see you doc  sure enough when he shoved his way to the front of the crowd medic was sitting on the floor of the respawn room blinking slowly and swaying left and right he clumsily raised a bluegloved arm and stared at it in childlike wonder before looking up at the gathered mercenaries  look he declared his eyes going unfocused hands  then he passed out  chapter fifteen becoming human  the violet spy had watched dispassionately as copy blm029c died the clones face went slack as the mind controlling the muscles shut down and the eyes glazed over for a moment the severed head looked serene and peaceful before it faded into nothingness as respawn took it  it was one of the more graceful deaths he had been involved in and one of the few nonpermanent ones when the administrator sent one of the originals out to a battlefield clones died  a copy wanting to retire and leave their employment execute them  one team of mercenaries not performing well remove the team  two identical copies assigned to the same battlefield wipe the slate clean keep the secret kill them all  spy knew that the stalemate between the powerful and insane mann brothers had to be maintained no matter what the cost was if they failed the world would burn the eleven of them were the fulcrum of the world the balancers of the scales the keepers of the peace  knowledge was power and spy liked power  he picked up the fake suicide note and brushed a finger over it before reverentially picking up the cooling hand of the dead red medic and slipping it under his bandaged fingers he placed the empty syringe close to his right hand the mans head was twisted to one side and he stared out of the window of the infirmary with a shocked expression that was slowly stiffening into an inhuman death rictus  because it is myduty because somevone somevhere has to give a damn because i choose to because i understand now i see you zhere and i know vhat i didto you and many ozhers because i alvays told myself sacrifices had to be made because i am sorry  when did the price for peace become too high  spy now knew the answer it already had he and his eight brothersinarms had discussed the use of the clones many times they had decided they were just toy soldiers not real people not like themselves the legions of copies were a resource to be used up spy god help him had agreed however the nature of his skills meant he spent more time down on the ground floor than the others and his experiences had altered him irrevocably  he had watched the clones grow and change becoming different to the originals they made friends protected their allies took revenge on their enemies and sometimes even fell in love they became unique and earned their individuality what was a person but a cloud of dreams hopes and memories tied together by flesh did it matter whether that flesh had been created in a mothers womb or a laboratory  the red medic had been willing to give his life to save his enemy the medic that the violet spy knew would never have done that where had that spark ofof humanity come from  he walked over to the late medics desk and opened the drawers until he found the mans journal he put it down the desk and sat down staring at it the medic clones generally had an obsession with recording anything and everything and the journal would have to be destroyed in order to keep the secret he brushed a hand over the battered leather cover  the blu medic had warned him why had he warned his captor why  he flicked the journal open to one of the last pages the doctors terrible spidery writing crawled across the page  it could have been me dying by inches and drowning in my own blood as it turned toxic i look at his face and see myself i feel like i have suddenly woken up and i can truly see for the first time in my life and i dont like the view one bit ive used so many people whatever i can do to put this right i have to do  spy closed the journal again and closed his eyes if this was the price for peace the world deserved to burn perhaps it was time for a little creative incompetence he carefully put the journal back onto the desk hopefully someone would read it and the blue touch paper would be lit he then cloaked and left the silent infirmary  spy knew he was heading for damnation but it didnt matter he was already in hell  doktor where are you heavy called cheerfully his voice echoing off the cheap plasterboard walls of the red base i have sandvich for you  medic had skipped lunch again honestly that man he needed food like everyone else and as a doctor he knew that at least he had had a good hearty breakfast they had eaten together with medic curled up against heavy and the blankets tumbled and knotted around them perhaps he shouldnt have stayed the night it would be dangerous if they were found out after all however medic had said he would hide under the bed if anyone came in and then heavy had pointed out that he could simply lock his door  as well as their other more physical activities they had talked for hours the previous night keeping their voices low so they were not overheard or rather medic had talked and heavy had listened needing to do nothing more than nod occasionally while he stroked medics soft hair the words had just flowed forth on all sorts of subjects a lot of it had been completely irrelevant such as the doctors passionate diatribe on the unusual cellular structure of chicken blood or his musings on the medical importance of the recent discovery of cholinesterase whatever that was however what the man actually said wasnt that important which was just as well since heavy understood about a tenth of it but the way he said it was while he spoke he held on tightly to the bigger man his head resting on heavys shoulder and his eyes closed he was trying to keep himself awake and stretch out the night to make it last as long as possible eventually the words became jumbled and slower dropping down to a sleepy content murmur  i dont vant to leave he had said finally with a sad sigh  then dont leave heavy had replied stay  ja i stay he had murmured his breathing becoming deep and soft  heavy had looked down at his sleeping lover and smiled slightly wondering whether spy really deserved to get his nose broken or not his teasing had most definitely not been goodnatured but he had forced medic to break down those final walls and stop hating himself for being human his doctor was at peace now calm and relaxed for the first time in his life ah well he could make a final decision about spy in the morning he had thought  now it was afternoon and sandwich in hand heavy poked his head into medics bedroom but he wasnt there presumably then he was in the infirmary working on whatever weird project he had on the go right now heavy walked along the corridor towards medics lair balancing his plate carefully  he paused outside the double doors feeling slightly puzzled it was awfully quiet and medic was not a quiet person when not actually talking he was always humming tunelessly pacing or clattering equipment about ah well he would go and check if he was there anyway he pushed the door open with his elbow  doktor  he peered in around the door and the plate dropped from his hand and shattered as he saw the man in the white coat sprawled gracelessly across the stretcher  gustav  in the busy hellish years that would follow heavy would never be able to remember the next few seconds perhaps he had blocked them out or maybe he simply had had no thoughts for that period of time one moment he was standing in the doorway and the next he had teleported to medic cradling him in his arms the man was cold and starting to stiffen he looked down at the grey face its eyes open and dull  he shook the mans cold shoulders and could hear himself babbling hoarsely as he desperately pulled medic onto his back and cradled his head knowing it was hopeless but unable to stop himself nyet nyet prosnutsya its me its me nye ostavlyay menya not happening this is not happening prosnutsya  ty mne nuzhen doktor nye ostavlyay menya we go together he squeezed his eyes shut and then opened them again and then held the dead man tightly rocking back and forth in despair  nye vi gustav nyetprosnutsya pozhaluysta  a small slip of paper fluttered down slowly from the gurney to the white tiled floor he picked it up in shaking hands and read it  a broken roar of pure anguish and pain shook teufort and three white doves flew high into the pure blue desert sky  blm029c slowly woke up but kept his eyes closed not wanting to face the world yet or indeed ever everything hurt from the neck downwards and it felt like the world was spinning around him like a childs toy the beating of his heart and movement of his lungs seemed incredibly distracting after so long without them and his limbs felt oddly shaped and awkward if he was lucky he could fall asleep and ignore this world for a bit longer if he was even luckier he wouldnt wake up again  everything hurt but the turmoil in his mind was the worst part of all he wanted the pain to get worse so it would drown out his thoughts in the confusion of the last few days every single certainty in his life had been burnt down life would never make any sense again and he had nothing left to cling to he felt homesick for a home he had never had a time he had never lived in and the person he had never been he couldnt even bring himself to ponder on the classic philosophical questions of who am i or why am i here because he knew the answers and they werent pleasant  coo the doves call was soft and sad and a hard beak pecked his ear insistently he winced but ignored it then there was a hard tug on his hair and he opened his eyes in annoyance  he was lying in a bed with crisp white sheets but without his glasses he couldnt make out much more than blurred walls and a lot of colourful shapes of different sizes on the table by the side of the bed  coo  galileo he croaked his voice barely louder than a whisper the dove tucked himself under medics chin and he could feel the little bird shivering he tried to make out what the colourful things were but everything was far too fuzzy there was a greyish object next to the white thing that looked like it could be his glasses and he reached for them only to find out he could barely control his arm and his flailing hand knocked a glass flying it fell off the table and shattered the noise deafeningly loud in the quiet room  medic the door to the infirmary opened and a oneeyed head poked in inquisitively he grinned in delight at the weakened man in the bed and then banged the door open lads hes awake the docs awake  vhat he tried to pull himself upright but his body just would not do as it was told as the blu mercenaries poured into the room bringing noise and life with them  fuck it doc bout time you woke up youve been out for two days  great to have you back doc boy you sure did worry us there for a bit  er he croaked as two huge arms grabbed him in a crushing bear hug and he was unable to do anything but dangle uselessly until heavy chose to release him  stop crowdin the poor bugger give im some air  doktor is back is happy day the arms gave him a final squeeze and then released him so that he thumped back onto the pillows  i told you he wasnt dead but none of you sorry maggots listened to me  whered the bird come from shoo filthy rats with wings  coo  yrrrrr whhhl hnnnn hurrrhudda hhrrrrn  bitte he whispered annoyed at his voice being so weak i need my glasses  here a bluegloved hand picked them up and placed them in his hand spy slipped through to the front of the group of men you gave us quite the fright docteur  medic tried not to flinch away from the frenchman and cleared his throat danketwo days you said  youve been out of it for five days in total engineer stated patting him on the shoulder and watching him carefully we found out yesterday from the administrator what happened its a wretched terrible thing for sure the reds medic did himself in with a needle full o cyanide and he had it all planned out beforehand meddled with respawn so hed stay dead seems that did a number on our systems as well and you got stuck smack dab in the middle of it all last battle when you died well son you just plain dint come back until three days ago  yeah and ye were right off your legs when you got back demo added seems bein stuck in the machine drained you doon to the last drop you got lots o time to rest and recover were in ceasefire til red hires themselves a new medic  until they create a new medic  i see he said slowly trying to figure out what the correct reply was but internally he was fuming as he thought back to how reds murder had been covered up he vowed he would make the administrator suffer for this somehow  coo pasteur and kepler flew down from their perch on top of a screen and landed on the back of medics bed next to galileo  leetle birds like doktor where did they come from  i have no idea blu lied quickly zhey can stay zhough lying on his back he could see three sets of beady eyes staring back at him the three birds looked identical from this distance especially without his glasses but they were all different galileo was smart and friendly kepler was sociable but rather stupid and pasteur was the shy one  his eyes widened as he stared at the birds and the clouds of exhaustion in his mind parted for a moment and let the clear sun flood through  how far and how deep did this rabbithole go  oh yes he now knew how to get the perfect revenge on the woman who had done this to them all and all it would take would be a few words  why would anyone top themselves scout asked breaking into his thoughts i just dont get it  those reds are just cowards one and all soldier declared maybe he was sick of getting his ass kicked by us heroes  show some respect boy engineer said warningly the guy mustve had some bad troubles to do such a terrible thing  medic tried to haul himself upright again and failed his disobedient arms flailing and slipping as he tried to push against the white sheets heavy suddenly grabbed him bodily and hauled him upright and he made an undignified squeak of protest he looked down and carefully forced his fingers to unfold his glasses  putting his glasses on was far more difficult than it should have been he had to move his arm like this fingers like this and every step of the exercise took concentration it seemed that during the three days of being just a head his nervous system had partly forgotten how arms worked finally he got them settled on his nose and the world became sharp and clear all of the blu team even spy looked relieved and happy that he was back he looked over at the colourful objects on the cluttered table there was a basket of fruit a rather pathetic bouquet of wilting desert flowers in a blue bow a purple box of chocolates a bottle of brown liquor and in front of those eight handmade get well soon cards the one with the inexpertlydrawn rainbow and unicorn could have been from pyro he decided while the one with the perfectly drawn times typeface must have been from engineer he later found out he was wrong about this it was from spy much to his surprise he worked his way along the row analysing each card to figure out who it was from in the front stood a sparklingly clean carafe of iced water and a bowl of grapes he found himself just staring the display numbly for a moment trying to figure out why it was there  all zhis he waved an arm clumsily zhis is razher unexpected  unexpected engineer chuckled and sat down on the edge of the bed shaking his head ruefully we missed you doc youre one o the team and youre our friend  medic could only gape in baffled shock and he felt his eyes start to prickle nooh no please not now but his tear glands were not listening whether it was surprise shock stress or just simple physical trauma from his horrible ordeal he couldnt say but as the wave of pure emotion dissolved him into a blubbering snotty mess he vaguely thought that maybe he had earned the privilege of letting himself be human just this once  chapter sixteen the broken angel  the next day medic 029c decided he was bored of being in bed and had got up to go for a stagger around the blu base with galileo riding on his shoulder he was rapidly recovering physically at least and he decided it was time to make a trip downstairs to the comms room  he and the administrator needed to have a little talk  stairs were tricky it seemed but he held on to the rail tightly and worked his way down each step at a time until he reached the deepest levels of the base  it was quiet and dusty in here as always and he padded over to the chair by the microphone and sat down gratefully before his legs gave out the microphone itself was cracked and bent for some reason but when he pressed the tapedon transmit button it still lit up  frau administrator a moment of your time bitte  what do you want twenty nine c the voice replied immediately medic raised his eyebrows in surprise the woman wasnt playing her normal mindgames and keeping him waiting  two zhings he replied leaning forward and steepling his fingers firstly i have a razher odd request i need some hair dye supplied before zhe next battle it vould beunfortunateif zhe reds recognised me  there was a pause before the voice replied thoughtfully so it would it will arrive tomorrow  secondly i vas vondering if you vould like to join me in a little zhought experiment  im not here to play games medic  very vell just listen zhen medic leaned back and looked at the ceiling it must be a busy job being zhe administrator  there was no reply  taking command of both sides of zhe battle zhat must be a full time job  there was another pause before she replied get to the point  and now i know zhat zhere are legions of battlegrounds around zhe vorld filled vith ve clones all of zhem fighting forvhatever reason ve fight for  there was more silence but now it seemed more busy and thoughtful than before  far more zhan one person can handle he leaned forward intently eyes narrowed sovhich of you is zhe original  there was a click as the speaker went suddenly dead  medic smiled dreadfully and left the silent room  red heavy had had all his tears stolen from him in the gulags of siberia so he watched dryeyed and dead inside as the scrapmetal coffin was slowly lowered into the dusty yellow desert soil of teufort he felt nothing but a tired cynical rage as his dearest friend his lover his broken angel went to his final rest  we commend the soul of our brother departed to almighty god and we commit his body to the earth engineer said his voice soft but clear and unwavering he picked up a handful of desert soil and flung it onto the coffin with a metallic clatter ashes to ashes dust to dust may you find the peace you never found in this life in the hereafter gustav hans daecher  the group of eight mercenaries lifted their assorted guns and pistols and each fired a shot into the clear pink dawn pyros flare gun fired a whistling firework it shot straight into the sky and exploded into pure red stars that crackled and faded into nothingness  goodbye doc engineer said with a sigh  soldier lifted the bugle to his lips and started to play the notes rang out pure in the still morning air for once he didnt have his helmet on and his eyes shone with emotion heavy looked around at the other mercenaries scout was holding his eyes wide open and face still jaw clenched so firmly it trembled and demo sniffed and wiped his nose on his sleeve sniper stood to attention his hat held to his waist respectfully pyro looked down at the hole in the ground as unreadable as always spy thoughhis shoulders shook and tears streamed down his face soaking into his damp balaclava his gloved hands trembled as he placed his pistol back into its hidden holster heavy felt nothing but disgust and loathing for the pathetic display  soldier sounded the last lingering note and then stood stiffly to attention for a few seconds there was a moments silence broken only by the distant call of a dove  come on fellas lets get this done engineer muttered grabbing a shovel the men pocketed weapons shuffled awkwardly and then started shovelling dry dirt into the hole that would be medics final home there were a few moments filled with nothing but the metallic clang of shovels on soil before spy finally broke the silence  i swear i didnt know this would happen he cried suddenly i swear it if i had knownah mon dieu i never meanti never knew it was only a little teasing  seems the doc didnt see it like that engineer replied coldly  heavy jabbed his spade into the dirt and flung it into the grave why had his doktor done this he must have had it planned before that last night together was that just a final act of reckless abandon before the end what had it meant to the man he played the last week back in his head but he couldnt see anything that could have warned him medic had been distracted yes but he had seemed happy  dont beat yerself up spy demo said gruffly ye couldnt have known he was sotroubled  i dont believe it soldier growled medic was no coward hed not take this easy path hewas murdered maybe by those goddamn blus  srrrrmmmhrrmms hhrrrrdrrr hrrsss hrrrrm surrssssurrrhnnnly mrrrrs nrrrrurrrnnns frrrrrlln pyro said shrugging  you could be right sparkie engineer sighed goddamn it doc why dint you talk to us first  it didnt make any sense it didnt make any sense he wouldnt do this not medic heavy put his shovel down  i need to go check on thing he told the others and walked off without looking back  he plodded back into the red base and down to the infirmary broken equipment littered the wrecked room and the central gurney lay on its side its ripped sheets tumbled across the floor amongst shattered glass his footsteps crunched as he waded through the mess towards medics untidy desk his large hand rested upon a battered leather journal and he picked it up carefully and flicked back to the previous week he sat down on the creaking chair and started to read the words of the dead doctor  june 10th 1968  birdwatching passerculus sandwichensis qty 1 western meadowlark qty 3 memo look up taxon name sniper is very ignorant  arrival at teufort a long and tiring journey while birdwatching today i saw something extraordinary i will need to make plans and investigate what this could possibly mean but i am determined to find out the truth even if it kills me  heavy frowned and turned the page  broken angel  searching for a soul  what will you do when your world burns down  it was 7am and blu medic 029c decided it was time to stop pretending to be sleep and pulled himself wearily out of bed the ceasefire would end today and it was time to get back to work he was supposedly fully recovered but the thought of going into battle again and facing the reds newly created replacement filled him with revulsion  he ran a hand through his freshly bleached hair rubbed his eyes coughed and then reached for his glasses he padded over to the mirror hanging on the back of his door  ergh  he looked like death pale sallow skin hollow cheeks three days of stubble and eyes set deeply into shadowed sockets he pulled his pyjama top down slightly it was still there a ring of pink scar tissue now circled the base of his neck his hand brushed over it tracing the slightly sore ridge with his fingers for a moment he pondered the way that humans showed their physical condition so much more obviously than other mammals why was that maybe because they were not a prey species and thus did not have to hide weakness he yawned so tired during the day he could keep the questions at bay but at night they rattled around his exhausted mind he supposed he would adapt in time but it was hard so very hard to find out your entire life was a lie  he had once as a child run along a path that had been eroded by a bad storm the ground had suddenly vanished from under his feet and he had fallen through the air utterly lost with no idea what had happened or how he had got there he felt that like again now  except that child had not been him he had had no childhood at a guess he had lived a mere seven or eight months at most his past belonged to someone else he wasnt gustav daecher german refugee disgraced doctor and trauma surgeon the only name that was truly his was blm029c one of many just a number entirely expendable and likely to live a life that would be nasty brutish and short and to be discarded when he was no longer of use  what kept him awake every night was the question what was his purpose not to fight in this strangely pointless war that was someone elses aim for him he needed something anything that he could cling to to give his life the tiniest hydrogen gas puff of meaning however his mind searched all through the night and no answer came  he was still staring at himself in the mirror this was no good moping like this would get him nowhere keep busy try not to think too much fill the day and maybe hed survive until tomorrow he squared his shoulders grabbed his towel and sponge bag and left his room a door banged open a little further down the corridor  hey doc off to the showers ill come with you scout said throwing a towel over his shoulder  ah ergood in the last few days scout had been well a pest no matter where he went the young man seemed to be determined to keep him company it was rather irritating really yes irritating definitely  ya sleep well  ja he lied shortly not particularly interested in conversation so early in the morning  awright then scout for once seemed to have picked up on his mood and kept silent as they walked to the shower block there was a wave of damp warmth as they entered the wet room and the sound of deep gravelly and astonishingly bad singing  heavy turn it down a bit i cant hear meself think demos voice complained through the steam as he entered mornin doc  doktor heavy turned around with a grin and rested his large arms on the tiled halfwall of the communal showers is great day everybody is well and sasha is excited to be back to work you stay with me and we kill many leetle red babies  if you vish he replied awkwardly since he had got back from his ordeal the team had beenhad been  friendly  he wasnt sure how to cope with that at all they were obviously determined to include him in everything now but he couldnt see what he had done to merit this a few times he had gone into the infirmary and simply sat and stared at the eight cards they had made trying to extract every single atom of meaning from them he had so little in common with any of them so why were they bothering with him what did they stand to gain from it  and yetwhile it was confusing disconcerting and foolish he felt like an addict who had injected their first ever dose of sweet diamorphine something deep within his soul wanted more and was determined to get it even if he couldnt quite figure out how he slowly discarded his clothes and got under the warm spray of water feeling it soothing his fractured nerves his mind gnawed at the problem and he had a sudden idea it might fail but surely it was worth a try  heavy i have been meaning to ask you a favour he said cautiously  name it doktor  ilost a book i vas reading i vas wondering if you had a copy i could borrow it is called zhe catcher in zhe rye i never finished it  medic had never seen heavy surprised before it was actually quite fascinating watching how his sparse eyebrows shot up his head and his nostrils flared like that for a moment he even thought the large mans cheeks reddened slightly before he smiled down at the doctor their eyes met  da doktor is hard to read but good book heavy looked at him searchingly i bring it over later after battle  danke  and oddly enough the world suddenly seemed a little bit brighter maybe just maybe he even felt a little spark of hope  later washed and cleanshaven medic wandered back to his infirmary galileo kepler and pasteur greeted him enthusiastically and demanded food he threw some seed onto the tiled floor of the room and watched them with the ghost of a smile  do you miss him  kepler and pasteur ignored him far more interested in their food but galileo looked up with his tiny black eyes they were far more expressive than any birds eyes had any right to be  i vill remember him and how he died ve should never forget him zhat is all ve can do  galileo flew up and landed on his shoulder pressing his soft head into medics cheek as he had so many times in reds infirmary he remembered reading that birds had a higher body temperature than humans and the little round skull certainly felt feverishly hot next to his skin he tickled the back of the doves head soothingly  mission begins in fifteen minutes  vell here ve go he said with a sigh if i meet zhe new red medic i am sawing his head off just on principle you understand and if i meet any spies  coo  he grabbed his blue rubber gloves and medigun and headed out of the whitetiled room  your chains are shattered  yet to them you cling  mission begins in five minutes  medic adjusted a strap and settled his backpack more comfortably it seemed a little heavier than he remembered but maybe that was simply because he had a new canister of medigun gas today his throat had that odd feeling again and he coughed slightly  you sure youre good to go doc engineer asked opening his toolbox and getting out his beloved wrench  ja i am entirely recovered medic lied easily and you  engineer grinned disarmingly oh sure it was just a stomach upset happens to us all sometimes im fine now shame the timing was so goshdarned bad  doktor stay with me today i keep you safe heavy ordered  mission begins in three minutes  hows the hand sniper soldier asked  healing nicely mate doc took the stitches out yesterday stings a bit but its fine  medic found himself vaguely wondering what the real dr daecher was doing right now probably living a life of luxury on the money 29c had made for him and getting that amnesty he had been trying to earn he suddenly hated the man  and then it happened the moment in his existence that he would later look back on and think of as the point when his old life shattered and was rebuilt into something new and astoundingly different there was a flash of blinding light in his mind as he realised the shocking astonishing implication of all that he had found out in the last few days  he was innocent  the records on his teammates were very clear on one thing the nine original mercenaries were all outlaws criminals and pariahs on the run from those who would do them harm they had accepted this work in return for protection medic carried their memories but he had not committed their crimes  mission begins in sixty seconds  he was free  he was free  teufort was designed like a cage he had realised as much to keep them in as to keep the outside world out it had never worried him before since where else did he have to go  now though like a white rose bud unfolding in the spring the world was opening up before him he and his eight colleagues had nothing to fear and no one to avoid the administrators hold on them was as ephemeral as a cloud in the midday sun  tortured by hope in the bloodred night  he would make allies he looked around at the other eight mercenary clones waiting in the resupply room for the approaching battle his comrades his friends maybe the only ones he had ever had all of them carried someone elses guilt not their own  and somewhere out there was 029a he would find him  mission begins in ten seconds  and now they could fight back against those who used them and threw them away  five  four  three  medic felt his face stretch into a terrible smile  two  one  soldier roared his usual battle cry as they poured out of the room medic 029c trained his medigun onto the back of heavy and ran after the team onto the battlements as he entered the battleground he felt as if a balloon of pure white joy had inflated within his chest he felt featherlight free and unburdened for the first time in his short shadowed life an explosion hit the concrete wall to his right covering him in scorching grit and he started to laugh he healed the wounds of his colleagues his friends and once again decided who would live and who would die and respawn and still he laughed he could not stop laughing would not stop  he was happier than he had ever been before as he flicked the switch on his gun and surrounded himself and heavy in a pure cocoon of holy blue light they ran forward mowing down the reds who stood in their way and his laughter rose into an insane shrieking banshee wail that echoed off the grim walls of teufort and rose high into the blue desert sky  he loved this part  the end
