sermons of john wesley sermon 1 text from the 1872 edition salvation by faith preached at st marys oxford before the university on june 18 1738 by grace are ye saved through faitheph 28 all the blessings which god hath bestowed upon man are of his mere grace bounty or favour his free undeserved favour favour altogether undeserved man having no claim to the least of his mercies it was free grace that formed man of the dust of the ground and breathed into him a living soul and stamped on that soul the image of god and put all things under his feet the same free grace continues to us at this day life and breath and all things for there is nothing we are or have or do which can deserve the least thing at gods hand all our works thou o god hast wrought in us these therefore are so many more instances of free mercy and whatever righteousness may be found in man this is also the gift of god wherewithal then shall a sinful man atone for any the least of his sins with his own works no were they ever so many or holy they are not his own but gods but indeed they are all unholy and sinful themselves so that every one of them needs a fresh atonement only corrupt fruit grows on a corrupt tree and his heart is altogether corrupt and abominable being come short of the glory of god the glorious righteousness at first impressed on his soul after the image of his great creator therefore having nothing neither righteousness nor works to plead his mouth is utterly stopped before god if then sinful men find favour with god it is grace upon grace if god vouchsafe still to pour fresh blessings upon us yea the greatest of all blessings salvation what can we say to these things but thanks be unto god for his unspeakable gift and thus it is herein godcommendeth his love toward us in that while we were yet sinners christ died to save us by grace then are ye saved through faith grace is the source faith the condition of salvation now that we fall not short of the grace of god it concerns us carefully to inquire  i what faith it is through which we are saved ii what is the salvation which is through faith iii how we may answer some objections i what faith it is through which we are saved 1 and first it is not barely the faith of a heathen now god requireth of a heathen to believe that god is that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him and that he is to be sought by glorifying him as god by giving him thanks for all things and by a careful practice of moral virtue of justice mercy and truth toward their fellow creatures a greek or roman therefore yea ascythian or indian was without excuse if he did not believe thus much the being and attributes of god a future state of reward and punishment and the obligatory nature of moral virtue for this is barely the faith of a heathen 2 nor secondly is it the faith of a devil though this goes much farther than that of a heathen for the devil believes not only that there is a wise and powerful god gracious to reward and just to punish but also that jesus is the son of god the christ the saviour of the world so we find him declaring in express terms i know thee who thou art the holy one of godluke 434 nor can we doubt but that unhappy spirit believes all those words which came out of the mouth of the holy one yea and whatsoever else was written by those holy men of old of two of whom he was compelled to give that glorious testimony these men are the servants of the most high god who show unto you the way of salvation thus much then the great enemy of god and man believes and trembles in believing that god was made manifest in the flesh that he will tread all enemies under his feet and that all scripture was given by inspiration of god thus fargoeth the faith of a devil thirdly the faith through which we are saved in that sense of the word which will hereafter be explained is not barely that which the apostles themselves had while christ was yet upon earth though they so believed on him as to leave all and follow him although they had then power to work miracles to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease yea they had then power and authority over all devils and which is beyond all this were sent by their master to preach the kingdom of god what faith is it then through which we are saved it may be answered first in general it is a faith in christ christ and god through christ are the proper objects of it herein therefore it is sufficiently absolutely distinguished from the faith either of ancient or modern heathens and from the faith of a devil it is fully distinguished by this it is not barely a speculative rational thing a cold lifeless assent a train of ideas in the head but also a disposition of the heart for thus saith the scripture with the heart man believeth unto righteousness and if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the lord jesus and shalt believe in thy heart that god hath raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved and herein does it differ from that faith which the apostles themselves had while our lord was on earth that it acknowledges the necessity and merit of his death and the power of his resurrection it acknowledges his death as the only sufficient means of redeeming man from death eternal and his resurrection as the restoration of us all to life and immortality inasmuch as he was delivered for our sins and rose again for our justification christian faith is then not only an assent to the whole gospel of christ but also a full reliance on the blood of christ a trust in the merits of his life death and resurrection a recumbency upon him as our atonement and our life as given for us and living in us and in consequence hereof a closing with him and cleaving to him as our wisdom righteousness sanctification and redemption or in one word our salvation ii what salvation it is which is through this faith is the second thing to be considered and first whatsoever else it imply it is a present salvation it is something attainable yea actually attained on earth by those who are partakers of this faith for thus saith the apostle to the believers at ephesus and in them to the believers of all ages not ye shall be though that also is true but ye are saved through faith ye are saved to comprise all in one word from sin this is the salvation which is through faith this is that great salvation foretold by the angel before god brought his firstbegotten into the world thou shalt call his name jesus for he shall save his people from their sins and neither here nor in other parts of holy writ is there any limitation or restriction all his people or as it is elsewhere expressed all that believe in him he will save from all their sins from original and actual past and present sin of the flesh and of the spirit through faith that is in him they are saved both from the guilt and from the power of it first from the guilt of all past sin for whereas all the world is guilty before god insomuch that should he be extreme to mark what is done amiss there is none that could abide it and whereas by the law is only the knowledge of sin but no deliverance from it so that by fulfilling the deeds of the law no flesh can be justified in his sight now the righteousness of god which is by faith of jesus christ is manifested unto all that believe now they are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in jesus christ him god hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood to declare his righteousness for or by the remission of the sins that are past now hath christ taken away the curse of the law being made a curse for us he hath blotted out the handwriting that was against us taking it out of the way nailing it to his cross there is therefore no condemnation now to them which believe in christ jesus and being saved from guilt they are saved from fear not indeed from a filial fear of offending but from all servile fear from that fear which hath torment from fear of punishment from fear of the wrath of god whom they now no longer regard as a severe master but as an indulgent father they have not received again the spirit of bondage but the spirit of adoption whereby they cry abba father the spirit itself also bearing witness with their spirits that they are the children of god they are also saved from the fear though not from the possibility of falling away from the grace of god and coming short of the great and precious promises thus have they peace with god through our lord jesus christ they rejoice in hope of the glory of god and the love of god is shed abroad in their hearts through the holy ghost which is given unto them and hereby they are persuaded though perhaps not at all times nor with the same fullness of persuasion that neither death nor life nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate them from the love of god which is in christ jesus our lord again through this faith they are saved from the power of sin as well as from the guilt of it so the apostle declares ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins and in him is no sin whosoever abideth in him sinneth not 1 john 35ff again little children let no man deceive you he that committeth sin is of the devil whosoever believeth is born of god and whosoever is born of god doth not commit sin for his seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he is born of god once more we know that whosoever is born of god sinneth not but he that is begotten of god keepeth himself and that wicked one toucheth him not 1 john 518 he that is by faith born of god sinneth not 1 by any habitual sin for all habitual sin is sin reigning but sin cannot reign in any that believeth nor 2 by any wilful sin for his will while he abideth in the faith is utterly set against all sin and abhorreth it as deadly poison nor 3 by any sinful desire for he continually desireth the holy and perfect will of god and any tendency to an unholy desire he by the grace of god stifleth in the birth nor 4 doth he sin by infirmities whether in act word or thought for his infirmities have no concurrence of his will and without this they are not properly sins thus he that is born of god doth not commit sin and though he cannot say he hath not sinned yet now he sinneth not this then is the salvation which is through faith even in the present world a salvation from sin and the consequences of sin both often expressed in the word justification which taken in the largest sense implies a deliverance from guilt and punishment by the atonement of christ actually applied to the soul of the sinner now believing on him and a deliverance from the power of sin through christ formed in his heart so that he who is thus justified or saved by faith is indeed born again he is born again of the spirit unto a new life which is hid with christ in god and as a newborn babe he gladly receives the adolon sincere milk of the word and grows thereby going on in the might of the lord his god from faith to faith from grace to grace until at length he come unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ iii the first usual objection to this is that to preach salvation or justification by faith only is to preach against holiness and good works to which a short answer might be given it would be so if we spake as some do of a faith which was separate from these but we speak of a faith which is not so but productive of all good works and all holiness but it may be of use to consider it more at large especially since it is no new objection but as old as st pauls time for even then it was asked do we not make void the law through faith we answer first all who preach not faith do manifestly make void the law either directly and grossly by limitations and comments that eat out all the spirit of the text or indirectly by not pointing out the only means whereby it is possible to perform it whereas secondly we establish the law both by showing its full extent and spiritual meaning and by calling all to that living way whereby the righteousness of the law may be fulfilled in them these while they trust in the blood of christ alone use all the ordinances which he hath appointed do all the good works which he had before prepared that they should walk therein and enjoy and manifest all holy and heavenly tempers even the same mind that was in christ jesus but does not preaching this faith lead men into pride we answer accidentally it may therefore ought every believer to be earnestly cautioned in the words of the great apostle because of unbelief the first branches were broken off and thou standest by faith be not highminded but fear if god spared not the natural branches take heed lest he spare not thee behold therefore the goodness and severity of god on them which fell severity but towards thee goodness if thou continue in his goodness otherwise thou also shalt be cut off and while he continues therein he will remember those words of st paul foreseeing and answering this very objection rom327 where is boasting then it is excluded by what law of works nay but by the law of faith if a man were justified by his works he would have whereof to glory but there is no glorying for him that worketh not but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly rom 45 to the same effect are the words both preceding and following the text eph 24ff god who is rich in mercy even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with christ by grace ye are saved that he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through christ jesus for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves of yourselves cometh neither your faith nor your salvation it is the gift of god the free undeserved gift the faith through which ye are saved as well as the salvation which he of his own good pleasure his mere favour annexes thereto that ye believe is one instance of his grace that believing ye are saved another not of works lest any man should boast for all our works all our righteousness which were before our believing merited nothing of god but condemnation so far were they from deserving faith which therefore whenever given is not of works neither is salvation of the works we do when we believe for it is then god that worketh in us and therefore that he giveth us a reward for what he himself worketh only commendeth the riches of his mercy but leaveth us nothing whereof to glory however may not the speaking thus of the mercy of god as saving or justifying freely by faith only encourage men in sin indeed it may and will many will continue in sin that grace may abound but their blood is upon their own head the goodness of god ought to lead them to repentance and so it will those who are sincere of heart when they know there is yet forgiveness with him they will cry aloud that he would blot out their sins also through faith which is in jesus and if they earnestly cry and faint not it they seek him in all the means he hath appointed if they refuse to be comforted till he come he will come and will not tarry and he can do much work in a short time many are the examples in the acts of the apostles of gods working this faith in mens hearts even like lightning falling from heaven so in the same hour that paul and silas began to preach the jailer repented believed and was baptized as were three thousand by st peter on the day of pentecost who all repented and believed at his first preaching and blessed be god there are now many living proofs that he is still mighty to save yet to the same truth placed in another view a quite contrary objection is made if a man cannot be saved by all that he can do this will drive men to despair true to despair of being saved by their own works their own merits or righteousness and so it ought for none can trust in the merits of christ till he has utterly renounced his own he that goeth about to stablish his own righteousness cannot receive the righteousness of god the righteousness which is of faith cannot be given him while he trusteth in that which is of the law but this it is said is an uncomfortable doctrine the devil spoke like himself that is without either truth or shame when he dared to suggest to men that it is such it is the only comfortable one it is very full of comfort to all selfdestroyed selfcondemned sinners that whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed that the same lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him here is comfort high as heaven stronger than death what mercy for all for zacchaeus a public robber for mary magdalene a common harlot methinks i hear one say then i even i may hope for mercy and so thou mayest thou afflicted one whom none hath comforted god will not cast out thy prayer nay perhaps he may say the next hour be of good cheer thy sins are forgiven thee so forgiven that they shall reign over thee no more yea and that the holy spirit shall bear witness with thy spirit that thou art a child of god o glad tidings tidings of great joy which are sent unto all people ho every one that thirsteth come ye to the waters come ye and buy without money and without price whatsoever your sins be though red like crimson though more than the hairs of your head return ye unto the lord and he will have mercy upon you and to our god for he will abundantly pardon when no more objections occur then we are simply told that salvation by faith only ought not to be preached as the first doctrine or at least not to be preached at all but what saith the holy ghost other foundation can no man lay than that which is laid even jesus christ so then that whosoever believeth on him shall be saved is and must be the foundation of all our preaching that is must be preached first well but not to all to whom then are we not to preach it whom shall we except the poor nay they have a peculiar right to have the gospel preached unto them the unlearned no god hath revealed these things unto unlearned and ignorant men from the beginning the young by no means suffer these in any wise to come unto christ and forbid them not the sinners least of all he came not to call the righteous but sinners to repentance why then if any we are to except the rich the learned the reputable the moral men and it is true they too often except themselves from hearing yet we must speak the words of our lord for thus the tenor of our commission runs go and preach the gospel to every creature if any man wrest it or any part of it to his destruction he must bear his own burden but still as the lord liveth whatsoever the lord saith unto us that we will speak at this time more especially will we speak that by grace are ye saved through faith because never was the maintaining this doctrine more seasonable than it is at this day nothing but this can effectually prevent the increase of the romish delusion among us it is endless to attack one by one all the errors of that church but salvation by faith strikes at the root and all fall at once where this is established it was this doctrine which our church justly calls the strong rock and foundation of the christian religion that first drove popery out of these kingdoms and it is this alone can keep it out nothing but this can give a check to that immorality which hath overspread the land as a flood can you empty the great deep drop by drop then you may reform us by dissuasives from particular vices but let the righteousness which is of god by faith be brought in and so shall its proud waves be stayed nothing but this can stop the mouths of those who glory in their shame and openly deny the lord that bought them they can talk as sublimely of the law as he that hath it written by god in his heart to hear them speak on this head might incline one to think they were not far from the kingdom of god but take them out of the law into the gospel begin with the righteousness of faith with christ the end of the law to every one that believeth and those who but now appeared almost if not altogether christians stand confessed the sons of perdition as far from life and salvation god be merciful unto them as the depth of hell from the height of heaven for this reason the adversary so rages whenever salvation by faith is declared to the world for this reason did he stir up earth and hell to destroy those who first preached it and for the same reason knowing that faith alone could overturn the foundations of his kingdom did he call forth all his forces and employ all his arts of lies and calumny to affright martin luther from reviving it nor can we wonder thereat for as that man of god observes how would it enrage a proud strong man armed to be stopped and set at nought by a little child coming against him with a reed in his hand especially when he knew that little child would surely overthrow him and tread him under foot even so lord jesus thus hath thy strength been ever made perfect in weakness go forth then thou little child that believest in him and his right hand shall teach thee terrible things though thou art helpless and weak as an infant of days the strong man shall not be able to stand before thee thou shalt prevail over him and subdue him and overthrow him and trample him under thy feet thou shalt march on under the great captain of thy salvation conquering and to conquer until all thine enemies are destroyed and death is swallowed up in victory now thanks be to god which giveth us the victory through our lord jesus christ to whom with the father and the holy ghost be blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving and honour and power and might for ever and ever amen  sermon 2 text from the 1872 edition the almost christian preached at st marys oxford before the university on july 25 1741 almost thou persuadest me to be a christian acts 2628 and many there are who go thus far ever since the christian religion was in the world there have been many in every age and nation who were almost persuaded to be christians but seeing it avails nothing before god to go only thus far it highly imports us to consider first what is implied in being almost secondly what in being altogether a christian i i 1 now in the being almost a christian is implied first heathen honesty no one i suppose will make any question of this especially since by heathen honesty here i mean not that which is recommended in the writings of their philosophers only but such as the common heathens expected one of another and many of them actually practised by the rules of this they were taught that they ought not to be unjust not to take away their neighbours goods either by robbery or theft not to oppress the poor neither to use extortion toward any not to cheat or overreach either the poor or rich in whatsoever commerce they had with them to defraud no man of his right and if it were possible to owe no man anything again the common heathens allowed that some regard was to be paid to truth as well as to justice and accordingly they not only held him in abomination who was forsworn who called god to witness to a lie but him also who was known to be a slanderer of his neighbour who falsely accused any man and indeed little better did they esteem willful liars of any sort accounting them the disgrace of human kind and the pests of society yet again there was a sort of love and assistance which they expected one from another they expected whatever assistance any one could give another without prejudice to himself and this they extended not only to those little offices of humanity which are performed without any expense or labour but likewise to the feeding the hungry if they had food to spare the clothing the naked with their own superfluous raiment and in general the giving to any that needed such things as they needed not themselves thus far in the lowest account of it heathen honesty went the first thing implied in the being almost a christian ii 4 a second thing implied in the being almost a christian is the having a form of godliness of that godliness which is prescribed in the gospel of christ the having the outside of a real christian accordingly the almost christian does nothing which the gospel forbids he taketh not the name of god in vain he blesseth and curseth not he sweareth not at all but his communication is yea yea nay nay he profanes not the day of the lord nor suffers it to be profaned even by the stranger that is within his gates he not only avoids all actual adultery fornication and uncleanness but every word or look that either directly or indirectly tends thereto nay and all idle words abstaining both from detraction backbiting talebearing evil speaking and from all foolish talking and jesting eutrapelia a kind of virtue in the heathen moralists account briefly from all conversation that is not good to the use of edifying and that consequently grieves the holy spirit of god whereby we are sealed to the day of redemption 5 he abstains from wine wherein is excess from revellings and gluttony he avoids as much as in him lies all strife and contention continually endeavouring to live peaceably with all men and if he suffer wrong he avengeth not himself neither returns evil for evil he is no railer no brawler no scoffer either at the faults or infirmities of his neighbour he does not willingly wrong hurt or grieve any man but in all things act and speaks by that plain rule whatsoever thou wouldest not he should do unto thee that do not thou to another and in doing good he does not confine himself to cheap and easy offices of kindness but labours and suffers for the profit of many that by all means he may help some in spite of toil or pain whatsoever his hand findeth to do he doeth it with his might whether it be for his friends or for his enemies for the evil or for the good for being not slothful in this or in any business as he hath opportunity he doeth good all manner of good to all men and to their souls as well as their bodies he reproves the wicked instructs the ignorant confirms the wavering quickens the good and comforts the afflicted he labours to awaken those that sleep to lead those whom god hath already awakened to the fountain opened for sin and for uncleanness that they may wash therein and be clean and to stir up those who are saved through faith to adorn the gospel of christ in all things he that hath the form of godliness uses also the means of grace yea all of them and at all opportunities he constantly frequents the house of god and that not as the manner of some is who come into the presence of the most high either loaded with gold and costly apparel or in all the gaudy vanity of dress and either by their unseasonable civilities to each other or the impertinent gaiety of their behaviour disclaim all pretensions to the form as well as to the power of godliness would to god there were none even among ourselves who fall under the same condemnation who come into this house it may be gazing about or with all the signs of the most listless careless indifference though sometimes they may seem to use a prayer to god for his blessing on what they are entering upon who during that awful service are either asleep or reclined in the most convenient posture for it or as though they supposed god was asleep talking with one another or looking round as utterly void of employment neither let these be accused of the form of godliness no he who has even this behaves with seriousness and attention in every part of that solemn service more especially when he approaches the table of the lord it is not with a light or careless behaviour but with an air gesture and deportment which speaks nothing else but god be merciful to me a sinner to this if we add the constant use of family prayer by those who are masters of families and the setting times apart for private addresses to god with a daily seriousness of behaviour he who uniformly practices this outward religion has the form of godliness there needs but one thing more in order to his being almost a christian and that is sincerity iii 9 by sincerity i mean a real inward principle of religion from whence these outward actions flow and indeed if we have not this we have not heathen honesty no not so much of it as will answer the demand of a heathen epicurean poet even this poor wretch in his sober intervals is able to testify oderunt peccare boni virtutis amore oderunt peccare mali formidine poenae good men avoid sin from the love of virtue wicked men avoid sin from a fear of punishment so that if a man only abstains from doing evil in order to avoid punishment nonpasces in cruce corvos thou shalt not be hanged saith the pagan there thou hast thy reward but even he will not allow such a harmless man as this to be so much as a good heathen if then any man from the same motive viz to avoid punishment to avoid the loss of his friends or his gain or his reputation should not only abstain from doing evil but also do ever so much good yea and use all the means of grace yet we could not with any propriety say this man is even almost a christian if he has no better principle in his heart he is only a hypocrite altogether 10 sincerity therefore is necessarily implied in the being almost a christian a real design to serve god a hearty desire to do his will it is necessarily implied that a man have a sincere view of pleasing god in all things in all his conversation in all his actions in all he does or leaves undone   this design if any man be almost a christian runs through the whole tenor of his life this is the moving principle both in his doing good his abstaining from evil and his using the ordinances of god but here it will probably be inquired is it possible that any man living should go so far as this and nevertheless be only almost a christian what more than this can be implied in the being a christian altogether i answer first that it is possible to go thus far and yet be but almost a christian i learn not only from the oracles of god but also from the sure testimony of experience brethren great is my boldness towards you in this behalf and forgive me this wrong if i declare my own folly upon the housetop for yours and the gospels sake suffer me then to speak freely of myself even as of another man i am content to be abased so ye may be exalted and to be yet more vile for the glory of my lord i did go thus far for many years as many of this place can testify using diligence to eschew all evil and to have a conscience void of offence redeeming the time buying up every opportunity of doing all good to all men constantly and carefully using all the public and all the private means of grace endeavouring after a steady seriousness of behaviour at all times and in all places and god is my record before whom i stand doing all this in sincerity having a real design to serve god a hearty desire to do his will in all things to please him who had called me to fight the good fight and to lay hold of eternal life yet my own conscience beareth me witness in the holy ghost that all this time i was but almost a christian ii if it be inquired what more than this is implied in the being altogether a christian i answer i 1 first the love of god for thus saith his word thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind and with all thy strength such a love is this as engrosses the whole heart as rakes up all the affections as fills the entire capacity of the soul and employs the utmost extent of all its faculties he that thus loves the lord his god his spirit continually rejoiceth in god his saviour his delight is in the lord his lord and his all to whom in everything he giveth thanks all his desire is unto god and to the remembrance of his name his heart is ever crying out whom have i in heaven but thee and there is none upon earth that i desire beside thee indeed what can he desire beside god not the world or the things of the world for he is crucified to the world and the world crucified to him he is crucified to the desire of the flesh the desire of the eye and the pride of life yea he is dead to pride of every kind for love is not puffed up but he that dwelling in love dwelleth in god and god in him is less than nothing in his own eyes  ii 2 the second thing implied in the being altogether a christian is the love of our neighbour for thus said our lord in the following words thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself if any man ask who is my neighbour we reply every man in the world every child of his who is the father of the spirits of all flesh nor may we in any wise except our enemies or the enemies of god and their own souls but every christian loveth these also as himself yea as christ loved us he that would more fully understand what manner of love this is may consider st pauls description of it it is longsuffering and kind it envieth not it is not rash or hasty in judging it is not puffed up but maketh him that loves the least the servant of all love doth not behave itself unseemly but becometh all things to all men she seeketh not her own but only the good of others that they may be saved love is not provoked itcasteth out wrath which he who hath is wanting in love it thinketh no evil it rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth it covereth all things believeth all things hopeth all things endureth all things iii 3 there is yet one thing more that may be separately considered though it cannot actually be separate from the preceding which is implied in the being altogether a christian and that is the ground of all even faith very excellent things are spoken of this throughout the oracles of god every one saith the beloved disciple that believeth is born of god to as many as received him gave he power to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith yea our lord himself declares he that believeth   in the son hath everlasting life and cometh not into condemnation but is passed from death unto life but here let no man deceive his own soul it is diligently to be noted the faith which bringeth not forth repentance and love and all good works is not that right living faith but a dead and devilish one for even the devils believe that christ was born of a virgin that he wrought all kinds of miracles declaring himself very god that for our sakes he suffered a most painful death to redeem us from death everlasting that he rose again the third day that he ascended into heaven and sitteth at the right hand of the father and at the end of the world shall come again to judge both the quick and dead these articles of our faith the devils believe and so they believe all that is written in the old and new testament and yet for all this faith they be but devils they remain still in their damnable estate lacking the very true christian faith homily on the salvation of man the right and true christian faith is to go on m the words of our own church not only to believe that holy scripture and the articles of our faith are true but also to have a sure trust and confidence to be saved from everlasting damnation by christ it is a sure trust and confidence which a man hath in god that by the merits of christ his sins are forgiven and he reconciled to the favour of god whereof doth follow a loving heart to obey his commandments now whosoever has this faith which purifies the heart by the power of god who dwelleth therein from pride anger desire from all unrighteousness from all filthiness of flesh and spirit which fills it with love stronger than death both to god and to all mankind love that doeth the works of god glorying to spend and to be spent for all men and that endureth with joy not only the reproach of christ the being mocked despised and hated of all men but whatsoever the wisdom of god permits the malice of men or devils to inflict whosoever has this faith thus working by love is not almost only but altogether a christian but who are the living witnesses of these things i beseech you brethren as in the presence of that god before whom hell and destruction are without a coveringhow much more the hearts of the children of men that each of you would ask his own heart am i of that number do i so far practise justice mercy and truth as even the rules of heathen honesty require if so have i the very outside of a christian the form of godliness do i abstain from evil from whatsoever is forbidden in the written word of god do i whatever good my hand findeth to do do it with my might do i seriously use all the ordinances of god at all opportunities and is all this done with a sincere design and desire to please god in all things are not many of you conscious that you never came thus far that you have not been even almost a christian that you have not come up to the standard of heathen honesty at least not to the form of christian godliness much less hath god seen sincerity in you a real design of pleasing him in all things you never so much as intended to devote all your words and works your business studies diversions to his glory you never even designed or desired that whatsoever you did should be done in the name of the lord jesus and as such should be a spiritual sacrifice acceptable to god through christ but supposing you had do good designs and good desires make a christian by no means unless they are brought to good effect hell is paved saith one with good intentions the great question of all then still remains is the love of god shed abroad in your heart can you cry out my god and my all do you desire nothing but him are you happy in god is he your glory your delight your crown of rejoicing and is this commandment written in your heart that he who loveth god love his brother also do you then love your neighbour as yourself do you love every man even your enemies even the enemies of god as your own soul as christ loved you yea dost thou believe that christ loved thee and gave himself for thee hast thou faith in his blood believest thou the lamb of god hath taken away thy sins and cast them as a stone into the depth of the sea that he hath blotted out the handwriting that was against thee taking it out of the way nailing it to his cross hast thou indeed redemption through his blood even the remission of thy sins and doth his spirit bear witness with thy spirit that thou art a child of god   the god and father of our lord jesus christ who now standeth in the midst of us knoweth that if any man die without this faith and this love good it were for him that he had never been born awake then thou that sleepest and call upon thy god call in the day when he may be found let him not rest till he make his goodness to pass before thee till he proclaim unto thee the name of the lord the lord the lord god merciful and gracious longsuffering and abundant in goodness and truth keeping mercy for thousands forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin let no man persuade thee by vain words to rest short of this prize of thy high calling but cry unto him day and night who while we were without strength died for the ungodly until thou knowest in whom thou hast believed and canst say my lord and my god remember always to pray and not to faint till thou also canst lift up thy hand unto heaven and declare to him that liveth for ever and ever lord thou knowest all things thou knowest that i love thee may we all thus experience what it is to be not almost only but altogether christians being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in jesus knowing we have peace with god through jesus christ rejoicing in hope of the glory of god and having the love of god shed abroad in our hearts by the holy ghost given unto us   sermon 3 text from the 1872 edition awake thou that sleepest preached on sunday april 4 1742 before the university of oxford by the rev charles wesley ma student of christchurch awake thou that sleepest and arise from the dead and christ shall give thee lighteph 514 in discoursing on these words i shall with the help of god  first describe the sleepers to whom they are spoken secondly enforce the exhortation awake thou that sleepest and arise from the dead and thirdly explain the promise made to such as do awake and arise christ shall give thee light i 1 and first as to the sleepers here spoken to by sleep is signified the natural state of man that deep sleep of the soul into which the sin of adam hath cast all who spring from his loins that supineness indolence and stupidity that insensibility of his real condition wherein every man comes into the world and continues till the voice of god awakes him now they that sleep sleep in the night the state of nature is a state of utter darkness a state wherein darkness covers the earth and gross darkness the people the poor unawakened sinner how much knowledge soever he may have as to other things has no knowledge of himself in this respect he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know he knows not that he is a fallen spirit whose only business in the present world is to recover from his fall to regain that image of god wherein he was created he sees no necessity for the one thing needful even that inward universal change that birth from above figured out by baptism which is the beginning of that total renovation that sanctification of spirit soul and body without which no man shall see the lord full of all diseases as he is he fancies himself in perfect health fast bound in misery and iron he dreams that he is at liberty he says peace peace while the devil as a strong man armed is in full possession of his soul he sleeps on still and takes his rest though hell is moved from beneath to meet him though the pit from whence there is no return hath opened its mouth to swallow him up a fire is kindled around him yet he knoweth it not yea it burns him yet he lays it not to heart by one who sleeps we are therefore to understand and would to god we might all understand it a sinner satisfied in his sins contented to remain in his fallen state to live and die without the image of god one who is ignorant both of his disease and of the only remedy for it one who never was warned or never regarded the warning voice of god to flee from the wrath to come one that never yet saw he was in danger of hellfire or cried out in the earnestness of his soul what must i do to be saved  if this sleeper be not outwardly vicious his sleep is usually the deepest of all whether he be of the laodicean spirit neither cold nor hot but a quiet rational inoffensive goodnatured professor of the religion of his fathers or whether he be zealous and orthodox and after the most straitest sect of our religion live a pharisee that is according to the scriptural account one that justifies himself one that labours to establish his own righteousness as the ground of his acceptance with god this is he who having a form of godliness denies the power thereof yea and probably reviles it wheresoever it is found as mere extravagance and delusion meanwhile the wretched selfdeceiver thanks god that he is not as other men are adulterers unjust extortioners no he doeth no wrong to any man he fasts twice in a week uses all the means of grace is constant at church and sacrament yea and gives tithes of all that he has does all the good that he can touching the   righteousness of the law he is blameless he wants nothing of godliness but the power nothing of religion but the spirit nothing of christianity but the truth and the life but know ye not that however highly esteemed among men such a christian as this may be he is an abomination in the sight of god and an heir of every woe which the son of god yesterday today and for ever denounces against scribes and pharisees hypocrites he hath made clean the outside of the cup and the platter but within is full of all filthiness an evil disease cleaveth still unto him so that his inward parts are very wickedness our lord fitly compares him to a painted sepulchre which appears beautiful without but nevertheless is full of dead mens bones and of all uncleanness the bones indeed are no longer dry the sinews and flesh are come upon them and the skin covers them above but there is no breath in them no spirit of the living god and if any man have not the spirit of christ he is none of his ye are christs if so be that the spirit of god dwell in you but if not god knoweth that ye abide in death even until now this is another character of the sleeper here spoken to he abides in death though he knows it not he is dead unto god dead in trespasses and sins for to be carnally minded is death  even as it is written by one man sin entered into the world and death by sin and so death passed upon all men not only temporal death but likewise spiritual and eternal in that day that thou eatest said god to adam thou shalt surely die not bodily unless as he then became mortal but spiritually thou shalt lose the life of thy soul thou shalt die to god shalt be separated from him thy essential life and happiness thus first was dissolved the vital union of our soul with god insomuch that in the midst of natural life we are now in spiritual death and herein we remain till the second adam becomes a quickening spirit to us till he raises the dead the dead in sin in pleasure riches or honours but before any dead soul can live he hears hearkens to the voice of the son of god he is made sensible of his lost estate and receives the sentence of death in himself he knows himself to be dead while he liveth dead to god and all the things of god having no more power to perform the actions of a living christian than a dead body to perform the functions of a living man and most certain it is that one dead in sin has not senses exercised to discern spiritual good and evil having eyes he sees not he hath ears and hears not he doth not taste and see that the lord is gracious he hath not seen god at any time nor heard his voice nor handled the word of life in vain is the name of jesus like ointment poured forth and all his garments smell of myrrh aloes and cassia the soul that sleepeth in death hath no perception of any objects of this kind his heart is past feeling and understandeth none of these things and hence having no spiritual senses no inlets of spiritual knowledge the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of god nay he is so far from receiving them that whatsoever is spiritually discerned is mere foolishness unto him he is not content with being utterly ignorant of spiritual things but he denies the very existence of them and spiritual sensation itself is to him the foolishness of folly how saith he can these things be how can any man know that he is alive to god even as you know that your body is now alive faith is the life of the soul and if ye have this life abiding in you ye want no marks to evidence it to yourself but elegchos pneumatos that divine consciousness that witness of god which is more and greater than ten thousand human witnesses if he doth not now bear witness with thy spirit that thou art a child of god o that he might convince thee thou poor unawakened sinner by his demonstration and power that thou art a child of the devil o that as i prophesy there might now be a noise and a shaking and may the bones come together bone to his bone then come from the four winds o breath and breathe on these slain that they may live and do not ye harden your hearts and resist the holy ghost who even now is come to convince you of sin because you believe not on the name of the only begotten son of god  ii 1 wherefore awake thou that sleepest and arise from the dead god calleth thee now by my mouth and bids thee know thyself thou fallen spirit thy true state and only concern below what meanest thou o sleeper arise call upon thy god if so be thy god will think upon thee that thou perish not a mighty tempest is stirred up round about thee and thou art sinking into the depths of perdition the gulf of gods judgements if thou wouldest escape them cast thyself into them judge thyself and thou shalt not be judged of the lord awake awake stand up this moment lest thou drink at the lords hand the cup of his fury stir up thyself to lay hold on the lord the lord thy righteousness mighty to save shake thyself from the dust at least let the earthquake of gods threatenings shake thee awake and cry out with the trembling jailer what must i do to be saved and never rest till thou believest on the lord jesus with a faith which is his gift by the operation of his spirit if i speak to any one of you more than to another it is to thee who thinkest thyself unconcerned in this exhortation i have a message from god unto thee in his name i warn thee to flee from the wrath to come thou unholy soul see thy picture in condemned peter lying in the dark dungeon between the soldiers bound with two chains the keepers before the door keeping the prison the night is far spent the morning is at hand when thou art to be brought forth to execution and in these dreadful circumstances thou art fast asleep thou art fast asleep in the devils arms on the brink of the pit in the jaws of everlasting destruction o may the angel of the lord come upon thee and the light shine into thy prison and mayest thou feel the stroke of an almighty hand raising thee with arise up quickly gird thyself and bind on thy sandals cast thy garment about thee and follow me awake thou everlasting spirit out of thy dream of worldly happiness did not god create thee for himself then thou canst not rest till thou restest in him return thou wanderer fly back to thy ark this is not thy home think not of building tabernacles here thou art but a stranger a sojourner upon earth a creature of a day but just launching out into an unchangeable state make haste eternity is at hand eternity depends on this moment an eternity of happiness or an eternity of misery  in what state is thy soul was god while i am yet speaking to require it of thee art thou ready to meet death and judgement canst thou stand in his sight who is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity art thou meet to be partaker of the inheritance of the saints in light hast thou fought a good fight and kept the faith hast thou secured the one thing needful hast thou recovered the image of god even righteousness and true holiness hast thou put off the old man and put on the new art thou clothed upon with christ hast thou oil in thy lamp grace in thy heart dost thou love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy mind and with all thy soul and with all thy strength is that mind in thee which was also in christ jesus art thou a christian indeed that is a new creature are old things passed away and all things become new art thou a partaker of the divine nature knowest thou not that christ is in thee except thou be reprobate knowest thou that god dwelleth in thee and thou in god by his spirit which he hath given thee knowest thou not that thy body is a temple of the holy ghost which thou hast of god hast thou the witness in thyself the earnest of thine inheritance hast thou received the holy ghost or dost thou start at the question not knowing whether there be any holy ghost if it offends thee be thou assured that thou neither art a christian nor desirest to be one nay thy very prayer is turned into sin and thou hast solemnly mocked god this very day by praying for the inspiration of his holy spirit when thou didst not believe there was any such thing to be received yet on the authority of gods word and our own church i must repeat the question hast thou received the holy ghost if thou hast not thou art not yet a christian for a christian is a man that is anointed with the holy ghost and with power thou art not yet made a partaker of pure religion and undefiled dost thou know what religion is that it is a participation of the divine nature the life of god in the soul of man christ formed in the heart christ in thee the hope of glory happiness and holiness heaven begun upon earth a kingdom of god within thee not meat and drink no outward thing but righteousness and peace and joy in the holy ghost an everlasting kingdom brought into thy soul a peace of god thatpasseth all understanding a joy unspeakable and full of glory knowest thou that in jesus christ neither circumcision availeth anything nor uncircumcision but faith that worketh by love but a new creation seest thou the necessity of that inward change that spiritual birth that life from the dead that holiness and art thou throughly convinced that without it no man shall see the lord art thou labouring after it giving all diligence to make thy calling and election sure working out thy salvation with fear and trembling agonizing to enter in at the strait gate art thou in earnest about thy soul and canst thou tell the searcher of hearts thou o god art the thing that i long for lord thou knowest all things thou knowest that i would love thee  thou hopest to be saved but what reason hast thou to give of the hope that is in thee is it because thou hast done no harm or because thou hast done much good or because thou art not like other men but wise or learned or honest and morally good esteemed of men and of a fair reputation alas all this will never bring thee to god it is in his account lighter than vanity dost thou know jesus christ whom he hath sent hath he taught thee that by grace we are saved through faith and that not of ourselves it is the gift of god not of works lest any man should boast hast thou received the faithful saying as the whole foundation of thy hope that jesus christ came into the world to save sinners hast thou learned what that meaneth i came not to call the righteous but sinners to repentance i am not sent but unto the lost sheep art thou he that heareth let him understand lost dead damned already dost thou know thy deserts dost thou feel thy wants art thou poor in spirit mourning for god and refusing to be comforted is the prodigal come to himself and well content to be therefore thought beside himself by those who are still feeding upon the husks which he hath left art thou willing to live godly in christ jesus and dost thou therefore suffer persecution do men say all manner of evil against thee falsely for the son of mans sake o that in all these questions ye may hear the voice that wakes the dead and feel that hammer of the word which breaketh the rocks in pieces if ye will hear his voice today while it is called today harden not your hearts now awake thou that sleepest in spiritual death that thou sleep not in death eternal feel thy lost estate and arise from the dead leave thine old companions in sin and death follow thou jesus and let the dead bury their dead save thyself from this untoward generation come out from among them and be thou separate and touch not the unclean thing and the lord shall receive thee christ shall give thee light iii 1 this promise i come lastly to explain and how encouraging a consideration is this that whosoever thou art who obeyest his call thou canst not seek his face in vain if thou even now awakest and arisest from the dead he hath bound himself to give thee light the lord shall give thee grace and glory the light of his grace here and the light of his glory when thou receivest the crown that fadeth not away thy light shall break forth as the morning and thy darkness be as the noonday god who commanded the light to shine out of darkness shall shine in thy heart to give the knowledge of the glory of god in the face of jesus christ on them that fear the lord shall the sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings and in that day it shall be said unto thee arise shine for thy light is come and the glory of the lord is risen upon thee for christ shall reveal himself in thee and he is the true light god is light and will give himself to every awakened sinner that waiteth for him and thou shalt then be a temple of the living god and christ shall dwell in thy heart by faith and being rooted and grounded in love thou shalt be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height of that love of christ which passeth knowledge ye see your calling brethren we are called to be an habitation of god through his spirit and through his spirit dwelling in us to be saints here and partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light so exceeding great are the promises which are given unto us actually given unto us who believe for by faith we receive not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god the sum of all the promises that we may know the things that are freely given to us of god   the spirit of christ is that great gift of god which at sundry times and in divers manners he hath promised to man and hath fully bestowed since the time that christ was glorified those promises before made to the fathers he hath thus fulfilled i will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes ezek 3627 i will pour water upon him that is thirsty and floods upon the dry ground i will pour my spirit upon thy seed and my blessing upon thine offspring isa443 ye may all be living witnesses of these things of remission of sins and the gift of the holy ghost if thou canst believe all things are possible to him that believeth who among you is there that feareth the lord and yet walketh on in darkness and hath no light i ask thee in the name of jesus believest thou that his arm is not shortened at all that he is still mighty to save that he is the same yesterday today and for ever that he hath now power on earth to forgive sins son be of good cheer thy sins are forgiven god for christs sake hath forgiven thee receive this not as the word of man but as it is indeed the word of god and thou art justified freely through faith thou shalt be sanctified also through faith which is in jesus and shalt set to thy seal even thine that god hath given unto us eternal life and this life is in his son men and brethren let me freely speak unto you and suffer ye the word of exhortation even from one the least esteemed in the church your conscience beareth you witness in the holy ghost that these things are so if so be ye have tasted that the lord is gracious this is eternal life to know the only true god and jesus christ whom he hath sent this experimental knowledge and this alone is true christianity he is a christian who hath received the spirit of christ he is not a christian who hath not received him neither is it possible to have received him and not know it for at that day when he cometh saith our lord ye shall know that i am in my father and you in me and i in you this is that spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you john 1417 the world cannot receive him but utterly reject the promise of the father contradicting and blaspheming but every spirit which confesseth not this is not of god yea this is that spirit of antichrist whereof ye have heard that it should come into the world and even now it is in the world he is antichrist whosoever denies the inspiration of the holy ghost or that the indwelling spirit of god is the common privilege of all believers the blessing of the gospel the unspeakable gift the universal promise the criterion of a real christian it nothing helps them to say we do not deny the assistance of gods spirit but only this inspiration this receiving the holy ghost and being sensible of it it is only this feeling of the spirit this being moved by the spirit or filled with it which we deny to have any place in sound religion but in only denying this you deny the whole scriptures the whole truth and promise and testimony of god our own excellent church knows nothing of this devilish distinction but speaks plainly of feeling the spirit of christ article 17 of being moved by the holy ghost office of consecrating priests and knowing and feeling there is no other name than that of jesus visitation of the sick whereby we can receive life and salvation she teaches us all to pray for the inspiration of the holy spirit collect before holy communion yea that we may be filled with the holy ghost order of confirmation nay and every presbyter of hers professes to receive the holy ghost by the imposition of hands therefore to deny any of these is in effect to renounce the church of england as well as the whole christian revelation but the wisdom of god was always foolishness with men no marvel then that the great mystery of the gospel should be now also hid from the wise and prudent as well as in the days of old that it should be almost universally denied ridiculed and exploded as mere frenzy and that all who dare avow it still are branded with the names of madmen and enthusiasts this is that falling away which was to comethat general apostasy of all orders and degrees of men which we even now find to have overspread the earth run to and fro in the streets of jerusalem and see if ye can find a man a man that loveth the lord his god with all his heart and serveth him with all his strength how does our own land mourn that we look no farther under the overflowings of ungodliness what villanies of every kind are committed day by day yea too often with impunity by those who sin with a high hand and glory in their shame who can reckon up the oaths curses profaneness blasphemies the lying slandering evilspeaking the sabbathbreaking gluttony drunkenness revenge the whoredoms adulteries and various uncleanness the frauds injustice oppression extortion which overspread our land as a flood and even among those who have kept themselves pure from those grosser abominations how much anger and pride how much sloth and idleness how much softness and effeminacy how much luxury and selfindulgence how much covetousness and ambition how much thirst of praise how much love of the world how much fear of man is to be found meanwhile how little of true religion for where is he that loveth either god or his neighbour as he hath given us commandment on the one hand are those who have not so much as the form of godliness on the other those who have the form only there stands the open there the painted sepulchre so that in very deed whosoever were earnestly to behold any public gathering together of the people i fear those in our churches are not to be excepted might easily perceive that the one part were sadducees and the other pharisees the one having almost as little concern about religion as if there were no resurrection neither angel nor spirit and the other making it a mere lifeless form a dull round of external performances without either true faith or the love of god or joy in the holy ghost would to god i could except us of this place brethren my hearts desire and prayer to god for you is that ye may be saved from this overflowing of ungodliness and that here may its proud waves be stayed but is it so indeed god knoweth yea and our own consciences it is not ye have not kept yourselves pure corrupt are we also and abominable and few are there that understand any more few that worship god in spirit and in truth we too are a generation that set not our hearts aright and whose spirit cleaveth not steadfastly unto god he hath appointed us indeed to be the salt of the earth but if the salt hath lost its savour it is thenceforth good for nothing but to be cast out and to be trodden underfoot of men and shall i not visit for these things saith the lord shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this yea we know not how soon he may say to the sword sword go through this land he hath given us long space to repent he lets us alone this year also but he warns and awakens us by thunder his judgements are abroad in the earth and we have all reason to expect the heaviest of all even that he should come unto us quickly and remove our candlestick out of its place except we repent and do the first works unless we return to the principles of the reformation the truth and simplicity of the gospel perhaps we are now resisting the last effort of divine grace to save us perhaps we have wellnigh filled up the measure of our iniquities by rejecting the counsel of god against ourselves and casting out his messengers 0 god in the midst of wrath remember mercy be glorified in our reformation not in our destruction let us hear the rod and him that appointed it now that thy judgements are abroad in the earth let the inhabitants of the world learn righteousness my brethren it is high time for us to awake out of sleep before the great trumpet of the lord be blown and our land become a field of blood o may we speedily see the things that make for our peace before they are hid from our eyes turn thou us o good lord and let thine anger cease from us o lord look down from heaven behold and visit this vine and cause us to know the time of our visitation help us o god of our salvation for the glory of thy name o deliver us and be merciful to our sins for thy names sake and so we will not go back from thee o let us live and we shall call upon thy name turn us again o lord god of hosts show the light of thy countenance and we shall be whole   now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we can ask or think according to the power that worketh in us unto him be glory in the church by christ jesus throughout all ages world without end amen   sermon 4 text of the 1872 edition scriptural christianity this sermon was originally published in a separate pamphlet accompanied by the following address to the reader to which was affixed the authors signature it was not my design when i wrote ever to print the latter part of the following sermon but the false and scurrilous accounts of it which have been published almost in every corner of the nation constrain me to publish the whole just as it was preached that men of reason may judge for themselvesedit preached at st marys oxford before the university august 24 1744 whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet and taketh not warning if the sword come and take him away his blood shall be upon his own head ezek 334 and they were all filled with the holy ghost acts 431 the same expression occurs in the second chapter where we read when the day of pentecost was fully come they were all the apostles with the women and the mother of jesus and his brethren with one accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind and there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire and it sat upon each of them and they were all filled with the holy ghost one immediate effect whereof was they began to speak with other tongues insomuch that both the parthians medes elamites and the other strangers who came together when this was noised abroad heard them speak in their several tongues the wonderful works of god acts 216 in this chapter we read that when the apostles and brethren had been praying and praising god the place was shaken where they were assembled together and they were all filled with the holy ghost not that we find any visible appearance here such as had been in the former instance nor are we informed that the extraordinary gifts of the holy ghost were then given to all or any of them such as the gifts of healing of working other miracles of prophecy of discerning spirits the speaking with divers kinds of tongues and the interpretation of tongues 1 cor 129 10 whether these gifts of the holy ghost were designed to remain in the church throughout all ages and whether or no they will be restored at the nearer approach of the restitution of all things are questions which it is not needful to decide but it is needful to observe this that even in the infancy of the church god divided them with a sparing hand were all even then prophets were all workers of miracles had all the gifts of healing did all speak with tongues no in no wise perhaps not one in a thousand probably none but the teachers in the church and only some of them 1 cor 122830 it was therefore for a more excellent purpose than this that they were all filled with the holy ghost it was to give them what none can deny to be essential to all christians in all ages the mind which was in christ those holy fruits of the spirit which whosoever hath not is none of his to fill them with love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness gal 52224 to endue them with faith perhaps it might be rendered fidelity with meekness and temperance to enable them to crucify the flesh with its affections and lusts its passions and desires and in consequence of that inward change to fulfil all outward righteousness to walk as christ also walked in the work of faith in the patience of hope the labour of love 1thess 13 without busying ourselves then in curious needless inquiries touching those extraordinary gifts of the spirit let us take a nearer view of these his ordinary fruits which we are assured will remain throughout all ages of that great work of god among the children of men which we are used to express by one word christianity not as it implies a set of opinions a system of doctrines but as it refers to mens hearts and lives and this christianity it may be useful to consider under three distinct views   i as beginning to exist in individuals ii as spreading from one to another iii as covering the earth i design to close these considerations with a plain practical application i 1 and first let us consider christianity in its rise as beginning to exist in individuals suppose then one of those who heard the apostle peter preaching repentance and remission of sins was pricked to the heart was convinced of sin repented and then believed in jesus by this faith of the operation of god which was the very substance or subsistence of things hoped for heb111 the demonstrative evidence of invisible things he instantly received the spirit of adoption whereby he now cried abba father rom 815 now first it was that he could call jesus lord by the holy ghost 1 cor 123 the spirit itself bearing witness with his spirit that he was a child of god rom 816 now it was that he could truly say i live not but christ liveth in me and the life which i now live in the flesh i live by faith in the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me gal 220 this then was the very essence of his faith a divine elegchos evidence or conviction of the love of god the father through the son of his love to him a sinner now accepted in the beloved and being justified by faith he had peace with god rom 51 yea the peace of god ruling in his heart a peace which passing all understanding panta noun all barely rational conception kept his heart and mind from all doubt and fear through the knowledge of him in whom he had believed he could not therefore be afraid of any evil tidings for his heart stood fast believing in the lord he feared not what man could do unto him knowing the very hairs of his head were all numbered he feared not all the powers of darkness whom god was daily bruising under his feet least of all was he afraid to die nay he desired to depart and to be with christ phil 123 who through death had destroyed him that had the power of death even the devil and delivered them who through fear of death were all their lifetime till then subject to bondageheb 215 his soul therefore magnified the lord and his spirit rejoiced in god his saviour he rejoiced in him with joy unspeakable who had reconciled him to god even the father in whom he had redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins he rejoiced in that witness of gods spirit with his spirit that he was a child of god and more abundantly in hope of the glory of god in hope of the glorious image of god and full renewal of his soul in righteousness and true holiness and in hope of that crown of glory that inheritance incorruptible undefiled and thatfadeth not away the love of god was also shed abroad in his heart by the holy ghost which was given unto him rom 55 because he was a son god had sent forth the spirit of his son into his heart crying abba father gal 46 and that filial love of god was continually increased by the witness he had in himself 1 john 510 of gods pardoning love to him by beholding what manner of love it was which the father had bestowed upon him that he should be called a child of god 1 john 31 so that god was the desire of his eyes and the joy of his heart his portion in time and in eternity he that thus loved god could not but love his brother also and not in word only but in deed and in truth if god said he so loved us we ought also to love one another 1 john 411 yea every soul of man as the mercy of god is over all his works ps 1459 agreeably hereto the affection of this lover of god embraced all mankind for his sake not excepting those whom he had never seen in the flesh or those of whom he knew nothing more than that they were the offspring of god for whose souls his son had died not excepting the evil and unthankful and least of all his enemies those who hated or persecuted or despitefully used him for his masters sake these had a peculiar place both in his heart and in his prayers he loved them even as christ loved us and love is not puffed up 1 cor 134 it abases to the dust every soul wherein it dwells accordingly he was lowly of heart little mean and vile in his own eyes he neither sought nor received the praise of men but that whichcometh of god only he was meek and longsuffering gentle to all and easy to be entreated faithfulness and truth never forsook him they were bound about his neck and wrote on the table of his heart by the same spirit he was enabled to be temperate in all things refraining his soul even as a weaned child he was crucified to the world and the world crucified to him superior to the desire of the flesh the desire of the eye and the pride of life by the same almighty love was he saved both from passion and pride from lust and vanity from ambition and covetousness and from every temper which was not in christ it may be easily believed he who had this love in his heart would work no evil to his neighbour it was impossible for him knowingly and designedly to do harm to any man he was at the greatest distance from cruelty and wrong from any unjust or unkind action with the same care did he set a watch before his mouth and keep the door of his lips lest he should offend in tongue either against justice or against mercy or truth he put away all lying falsehood and fraud neither was guile found in his mouth he spake evil of no man nor did an unkind word ever come out of his lips and as he was deeply sensible of the truth of that word without me ye can do nothing and consequently of the need he had to be watered of god every moment so he continued daily in all the ordinances of god the stated channels of his grace to man in the apostles doctrine or teaching receiving that food of the soul with all readiness of heart in the breaking of bread which he found to be the communion of the body of christ and in the prayers and praises offered up by the great congregation and thus he daily grew in grace increasing in strength in the knowledge and love of god but it did not satisfy him barely to abstain from doing evil his soul was athirst to do good the language of his heart continually was my fatherworketh hitherto and i work my lord went about doing good and shall not i tread in his steps as he had opportunity therefore if he could do no good of a higher kind he fed the hungry clothed the naked helped the fatherless or stranger visited and assisted them that were sick or in prison he gave all his goods to feed the poor he rejoiced to labour or to suffer for them and whereinsoever he might profit another there especially to deny himself he counted nothing too dear to part with for them as well remembering the word of his lord inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren ye have done it unto me matt 2540  such was christianity in its rise such was a christian in ancient days such was every one of those who when they heard thethreatenings of the chief priests and elders lifted up their voice to god with one accord and were all filled with the holy ghost the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul so did the love of him in whom they had believed constrain them to love one another neither said any of them that aught of the things which he possessed was his own but they had all things common so fully were they crucified to the world and the world crucified to them and they continued steadfastly with one accord in the apostles doctrine and in the breaking of bread and in prayers acts 242 and great grace was upon them all neither was there any among them that lacked for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them and brought the prices of the things that were sold and laid them down at the apostles feet and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need acts 43135 ii 1 let us take a view in the second place of this christianity as spreading from one to another and so gradually making its way into the world for such was the will of god concerning it who did not light a candle to put it under a bushel but that it might give light to all that were in the house and this our lord had declared to his first disciples ye are the salt of the earth the light of the world at the same time that he gave that general command let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven matt 51316 2 and indeed supposing a few of these lovers of mankind to see the whole world lying in wickedness can we believe they would be unconcerned at the sight at the misery of those for whom their lord died would not their bowels yearn over them and their hearts melt away for very trouble could they then stand idle all the day long even were there no command from him whom they loved rather would they not labour by all possible means to pluck some of these brands out of the burning undoubtedly they would they would spare no pains to bring back whomsoever they could of those poor sheep that had gone astray to the great shepherd and bishop of their souls 1 pet 225 so the christians of old did they laboured having opportunity to do good unto all men gal 610 warning them to flee from the wrath to come now now to escape the damnation of hell they declared the times of ignorance god winked at but now hecalleth all men everywhere to repent acts 1730 they cried aloud turn ye turn ye from your evil ways so iniquity shall not be your ruin ezek 1830 they reasoned with them of temperance and righteousness or justiceof the virtues opposite to their reigning sins and of judgement to comeof the wrath of god which would surely be executed on evildoers in that day when he should judge the world acts 2425 they endeavoured herein to speak to every man severally as he had need to the careless to those who lay unconcerned in darkness and in the shadow of death they thundered awake thou that sleepest arise from the dead and christ shall give thee light but to those who were already awakened out of sleep and groaning under a sense of the wrath of god their language was we have an advocate with the father he is the propitiation for our sins meantime those who had believed they provoked to love and to good works to patient continuance in welldoing and to abound more and more in that holiness without which no man can see the lord heb 1214 and their labour was not in vain in the lord his word ran and was glorified it grew mightily and prevailed but so much the more did offences prevail also the world in general were offended because they testified of it that the works thereof were evil john 77 the men of pleasure were offended not only because these men were made as it were to reprove their thoughts he professeth said they to have the knowledge of god hecalleth himself the child of the lord his life is not like other mens his ways are of another fashion heabstaineth from our ways as from filthiness he maketh his boast that god is his father wis 21316 but much more because so many of their companions were taken away and would no more run with them to the same excess of riot 1 pet 44 the men of reputation were offended because as the gospel spread they declined in the esteem of the people and because many no longer dared to give them flattering titles or to pay man the homage due to god only the men of trade called one another together and said sirs ye know that by this craft we have our wealth but ye see and hear that these men have persuaded and turned away much people so that this our craft is in danger to be set at nought acts 1925ff above all the men of religion so called the men of outside religion the saints of the world were offended and ready at every opportunity to cry out men of israel help we have found these men pestilent fellows movers of sedition throughout the world acts 245 these are the men that teach all men everywhere against the people and against this place acts 2128 thus it was that the heavens grew black with clouds and the storm gathered amain for the more christianity spread the more hurt was done in the account of those who received it not and the number increased of those who were more and more enraged at these men who thus turned the world upside down acts 176 insomuch that more and more cried out away with such fellows from the earth it is not fit that they should live yea and sincerely believed that whosoever should kill them would do god service meanwhile they did not fail to cast out their name as evil luke 622 so that this sect was everywhere spoken against acts 2722 men said all manner of evil of them even as had been done of the prophets that were before them matt 512 and whatsoever any would affirm others would believe so that offences grew as the stars of heaven for multitude and hence arose at the time foreordained of the father persecution in all its forms some for a season suffered only shame and reproach some the spoiling of their goods some had trial of mocking and scourging some of bonds and imprisonment and others resisted unto blood heb 1034 1136ff now it was that the pillars of hell were shaken and the kingdom of god spread more and more sinners were everywhere turned from darkness to light and from the power of satan unto god he gave his children such a mouth and such wisdom as all their adversaries could not resist and their lives were of equal force with their words but above all their sufferings spake to all the world they approved themselves the servants of god in afflictions in necessities in distresses in stripes in imprisonments in tumults in labours in perils in the sea in perils in the wilderness in weariness and painfulness in hunger and thirst in cold and nakedness 2 cor 64ff and when having fought the good fight they were led as sheep to the slaughter and offered up on the sacrifice and service of their faith then the blood of each found a voice and the heathen owned he being dead yet speaketh 9 thus did christianity spread itself in the earth but how soon did the tares appear with the wheat and the mystery of iniquity work as well as the mystery of godliness how soon did satan find a seat even in the temple of god till the woman fled into the wilderness and the faithful were again minished from the children of men here we tread a beaten path the still unceasing corruptions of the succeeding generations have been largely described from time to time by those witnesses god raised up to show that he had built his church upon a rock and the gates of hell should not wholly prevail against her matt 1618 iii 1 but shall we not see greater things than these yea greater than have been yet from the beginning of the world can satan cause the truth of god to fail or his promises to be of none effect if not the time will come when christianity will prevail over all and cover the earth let us stand a little and survey the third thing which was proposed this strange sight a christian world of this the prophets of old inquired and searched diligently 1 pet 110 11ff of this the spirit which was in them testified it shall come to pass in the last days that the mountain of the lords house shall be established in the top of the mountains and shall be exalted above the hills and all nations shall flow unto it and they shall beat their swords into ploughshares and their spears into pruninghooks nation shall not lift up sword against nation neither shall they learn war any more isa 214 in that day there shall be a root ofjesse which shall stand for an ensign of the people to it shall the gentiles seek and his rest shall be glorious and it shall come to pass in that day that the lord shall set his hand again to recover the remnant of his people and he shall set up an ensign for the nations and shall assemble the outcasts of israel and gather together the dispersed ofjudah from the four corners of the earth isa 111012 the wolf shall then dwell with the lamb and the leopard shall lie down with the kid and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together and a little child shall lead them they shall not hurt nor destroy saith the lord in all my holy mountain for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the lord as the waters cover the seaisa 1169 to the same effect are the words of the great apostle which it is evident have never yet been fulfilled hath god cast away his people god forbid but through their fall salvation is come to the gentiles and if the diminishing of them be the riches of the gentiles how much more their fullness for i would not brethren that ye should be ignorant of this mystery that blindness in part is happened to israel until the fullness of the gentiles be come in and so all israel shall be saved rom 111 11 25 26 suppose now the fullness of time to be come and the prophecies to be accomplished what a prospect is this all is peace quietness and assurance for ever here is no din of arms no confused noise no garments rolled in blood destructions are come to a perpetual end wars are ceased from the earth neither are there any intestine jars remaining no brother rising up against brother no country or city divided against itself and tearing out its own bowels civil discord is at an end for evermore and none is left either to destroy or hurt his neighbour here is no oppression to make even the wise man mad no extortion to grind the face of the poor no robbery or wrong no rapine or injustice for all are content with such things as they possess thus righteousness and peace have kissed each other ps 8510 they have taken root and filled the land righteousness flourishing out of the earth and peace looking down from heaven and with righteousness or justice mercy is also found the earth is no longer full of cruel habitations the lord hath destroyed both the bloodthirsty and malicious the envious and revengeful man were there any provocation there is none that nowknoweth to return evil for evil but indeed there is none that doeth evil no not one for all are harmless as doves and being filled with peace and joy in believing and united in one body by one spirit they all love as brethren they are all of one heart and of one soul neither saith any of them that aught of the things which hepossesseth is his own there is none among them that lacketh for every man loveth his neighbour as himself and all walk by one rule whatever ye would that men should do unto you even so do unto them it follows that no unkind word can ever be heard among them no strife of tongues no contention of any kind no railing or evilspeaking but every one opens his mouth with wisdom and in his tongue there is the law of kindness equally incapable are they of fraud or guile their love is without dissimulation their words are always the just expression of their thoughts opening a window into their breast that whosoever desires may look into their hearts and see that only love and god are there 6 thus where the lord omnipotent taketh to himself his mighty power and reigneth doth he subdue all things to himself cause every heart to overflow with love and fill every mouth with praise happy are the people that are in such a case yea blessed are the people who have the lord for their god psalm 14415 arise shine saith the lord for thy light is come and the glory of the lord is risen upon thee thou hast known that i the lord am thy saviour and thy redeemer the mighty god of jacob i have made thy officers peace and thy exactors righteousness violence shall no more be heard in thy land wasting nor destruction within thy borders but thou shalt call thy walls salvation and thy gates praise thy people are all righteous they shall inherit the land for ever the branch of my planting the work of my hands that i may be glorified the sun shall be no more thy light by day neither for brightness shall the moon give light unto thee but the lord shall be unto thee an everlasting light and thy god thy glory isa 601 1619 iv having thus briefly considered christianity as beginning as going on and as covering the earth it remains only that i should close the whole with a plain practical application and first i would ask where does this christianity now exist where i pray do the christians live which is the country the inhabitants whereof are all thus filled with the holy ghost are all of one heart and of one soul cannot suffer one among them to lack anything but continually give to every man as he hath need who one and all have the love of god filling their hearts and constraining them to love their neighbour as themselves who have all put on bowels of mercy humbleness of mind gentleness longsuffering who offend not in any kind either by word or deed against justice mercy or truth but in every point do unto all men as they would these should do unto them with what propriety can we term any a christian country which does not answer this description why then let us confess we have never yet seen a christian country upon earth i beseech you brethren by the mercies of god if ye do account me a madman or a fool yet as a fool bear with me it is utterly needful that some one should use great plainness of speech towards you it is more especially needful at this time for whoknoweth but it is the last whoknoweth how soon the righteous judge may say i will no more be entreated for this people thoughnoah daniel and job were in this land they should but deliver their own souls and who will use this plainness if i do not therefore i even i will speak and i adjure you by the living god that ye steel not your breasts against receiving a blessing at my hands do not say in your hearts non persuadebis etiamsi persuaseris your persuasions shall not prevail with us even though they should really convince usedit or in other words lord thou shalt not send by whom thou wilt send let me rather perish in my blood than be saved by this man brethren i am persuaded better things of you though i thus speak let me ask you then in tender love and in the spirit of meekness is this city a christian city is christianity scriptural christianity found here are we considered as a community of men so filled with the holy ghost as to enjoy in our hearts and show forth in our lives the genuine fruits of that spirit are all the magistrates all heads and governors of colleges and halls and their respective societies not to speak of the inhabitants of the town of one heart and one soul is the love of god shed abroad in our hearts are our tempers the same that were in him and are our lives agreeable thereto are we holy as he who hath called us is holy in all manner of conversation i entreat you to observe that here are no peculiar notions now under consideration that the question moved is not concerning doubtful opinions of one kind or another but concerning the undoubted fundamental branches if there be any such of our common christianity and for the decision thereof i appeal to your own conscience guided by the word of god he therefore that is not condemned by his own heart let him go free in the fear then and in the presence of the great god before whom both you and i shall shortly appear i pray you that are in authority over us whom i reverence for your office sake to consider and not after the manner of dissemblers with god are you filled with the holy ghost are you lively portraitures of him whom ye are appointed to represent among men i have said ye are gods ye magistrates and rulers ye are by office so nearly allied to the god of heaven in your several stations and degrees ye are to show forth unto us the lord our governor are all the thoughts of your hearts all your tempers and desires suitable to your high calling are all your words like unto those which come out of the mouth of god is there in all your actions dignity and love a greatness which words cannot express which can flow only from a heart full of god and yet consistent with the character of man that is a worm and the son of man that is a worm ye venerable men who are more especially called to form the tender minds of youth to dispel thence the shades of ignorance and error and train them up to be wise unto salvation are you filled with the holy ghost with all those fruits of the spirit which your important office so indispensably requires is your heart whole with god full of love and zeal to set up his kingdom on earth do you continually remind those under your care that the one rational end of all our studies is to know love and serve the only true god and jesus christ whom he hath sent do you inculcate upon them day by day that love alone neverfaileth whereas whether there be tongues they shall fail or philosophical knowledge it shall vanish away and that without love all learning is but splendid ignorance pompous folly vexation of spirit has all you teach an actual tendency to the love of god and of all mankind for his sake have you an eye to this end in whatever you prescribe touching the kind the manner and the measure of their studies desiring and labouring that wherever the lot of these young soldiers of christ is cast they may be so many burning and shining lights adorning the gospel of christ in all things and permit me to ask do you put forth all your strength in the vast work you have undertaken do you labour herein with all your might exerting every faculty of your soul using every talent which god hath lent you and that to the uttermost of your power let it not be said that i speak here as if all under your care were intended to be clergymen not so i only speak as if they were all intended to be christians but what example is set them by us who enjoy the beneficence of our forefathers by fellows students scholars more especially those who are of some rank and eminence do ye brethren abound in the fruits of the spirit in lowliness of mind in selfdenial and mortification in seriousness and composure of spirit in patience meekness sobriety temperance and in unwearied restless endeavours to do good in every kind unto all men to relieve their outward wants and to bring their souls to the true knowledge and love of god is this the general character of fellows of colleges i fear it is not rather have not pride and haughtiness of spirit impatience and peevishness sloth and indolence gluttony and sensuality and even a proverbial uselessness been objected to us perhaps not always by our enemies nor wholly without ground o that god would roll away this reproach from us that the very memory of it might perish for ever many of us are more immediately consecrated to god called to minister in holy things are we then patterns to the rest in word in conversation in charity in spirit in faith in purity 1tim 412 is there written on our forehead and on our heart holiness to the lord from what motives did we enter upon this office was it indeed with a single eye to serve god trusting that we were inwardly moved by the holy ghost to take upon us this ministration for the promoting of his glory and the edifying of his people and have we clearly determined by gods grace to give ourselves wholly to this office do we forsake and set aside as much as in us lies all worldly cares and studies do we apply ourselves wholly to this one thing and draw all our cares and studies this way are we apt to teach are we taught of god that we may be able to teach others also do we know god do we know jesus christ hath god revealed his son in us and hath he made us able ministers of the new covenant where then are the seals of our apostleship who that were dead in trespasses and sins have been quickened by our word have we a burning zeal to save souls from death so that for their sake we often forget even to eat our bread do we speak plain by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every mans conscience in the sight of god 2 cor 42 are we dead to the world and the things of the world laying up all our treasure in heaven do we lord over gods heritage or are we the least the servants of all when we bear the reproach of christ does it sit heavy upon us or do we rejoice therein when we are smitten on the one cheek do we resent it are we impatient of affronts or do we turn the other also not resisting the evil but overcoming evil with good have we a bitter zeal inciting us to strive sharply and   passionately with them that are out of the way or is our zeal the flame of love so as to direct all our words with sweetness lowliness and meekness of wisdom once more what shall we say concerning the youth of this place have you either the form or the power of christian godliness are you humble teachable advisable or stubborn selfwilled heady and highminded are you obedient to your superiors as to parents or do you despise those to whom you owe the tenderest reverence are you diligent in your easy business pursuing your studies with all your strength do you redeem the time crowding as much work into every day as it can contain rather are ye not conscious to yourselves that you waste away day after day either in reading what has no tendency to christianity or in gaming or inyou know not what are you better managers of your fortune than of your time do you out of principle take care to owe no man anything do you remember the sabbath day to keep it holy to spend it in the more immediate worship of god when you are in his house do you consider that god is there do you behave as seeing him that is invisible do you know how to possess your bodies in sanctification and honour are not drunkenness and uncleanness found among you yea are there not of you who glory in their shame do not many of you take the name of god in vain perhaps habitually without either remorse or fear yea are there not a multitude of you that are forsworn i fear a swiftlyincreasing multitude be not surprised brethren before god and this congregation i own myself to have been of the number solemnly swearing to observe all those customs which i then knew nothing of and those statutes which i did not so much as read over either then or for some years after what is perjury if this is not but if it be o what a weight of sin yea sin of no common dyelieth upon us and doth not the most high regard it may it not be one of the consequences of this that so many of you are a generation of triflers triflers with god with one another and with your own souls for how few of you spend from one week to another a single hour in private prayer how few have any thought of god in the general tenor of your conversation who of you is in any degree acquainted with the work of his spirit his supernatural work in the souls of men can you bear unless now and then in a church any talk of the holy ghost would you not take it for granted if one began such a conversation that it was either hypocrisy or enthusiasm in the name of the lord god almighty i ask what religion are you of even the talk of christianity ye cannot will not bear o my brethren what a christian city is this it is time for thee lord to lay to thine hand for indeed what probability what possibility rather speaking after the manner of men is there that christianity scriptural christianity should be again the religion of this place that all orders of men among us should speak and live as men filled with the holy ghost by whom should this christianity be restored by those of you that are in authority are you convinced then that this is scriptural christianity are you desirous it should be restored and do ye not count your fortune liberty life dear unto yourselves so ye may be instrumental in the restoring of it but suppose ye have this desire who hath any power proportioned to the effect perhaps some of you have made a few faint attempts but with how small success shall christianity then be restored by young unknown inconsiderable men i know not whether ye yourselves could suffer it would not some of you cry out young man in so doing thoureproachest us but there is no danger of your being put to the proof so hath iniquity overspread us like a flood whom then shall god send the famine the pestilence the last messengers of god to a guilty land or the sword the armies of the romish aliens to reform us into our first love nay rather let us fall into thy hand o lord and let us not fall into the hand of man lord save or we perish take us out of the mire that we sink not o help us against these enemies for vain is the help of man unto thee all things are possible according to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to die and preserve us in the manner that seemeth to thee good not as we will but as thou wilt   sermon 5 text from the 1872 edition justification by faith to him that worketh not but believeth on him thatjustifieth the ungodly his faith is counted for righteousness romans 45 how a sinner may be justified before god the lord and judge of all is a question of no common importance to every child of man it contains the foundation of all our hope inasmuch as while we are at enmity with god there can be no true peace no solid joy either in time or in eternity what peace can there be while our own heart condemns us and much more he that is greater than our heart and knoweth all things what solid joy either in this world or that to come while the wrath of god abideth on us and yet how little hath this important question been understood what confused notions have many had concerning it indeed not only confused but often utterly false contrary to the truth as light to darkness notions absolutely inconsistent with the oracles of god and with the whole analogy of faith and hence erring concerning the very foundation they could not possibly build thereon at least not gold silver or precious stones which would endure when tried as by fire but only hay and stubble neither acceptable to god nor profitable to man in order to justice in far as in me lies to the vast importance of the subject to save those that seek the truth in sincerity from vain jangling and strife of words to clear the confusedness of thought into which so many have already been led thereby and to give them true and just conceptions of this great mystery of godliness i shall endeavour to show first what is the general ground of this whole doctrine of justification secondly what justification is thirdly who they are that are justified and fourthly on what terms they are justified i i am first to show what is the general ground of this whole doctrine of justification in the image of god was man made holy as he that created him is holy merciful as the author of all is merciful perfect as his father in heaven is perfect as god is love so man dwelling in love dwelt in god and god in him god made him to be an image of his own eternity an incorruptible picture of the god of glory he was accordingly pure as god is pure from every spot of sin he knew not evil in any kind or degree but was inwardly and outwardly sinless and undefiled he loved the lord his god with all his heart and with all his mind and soul and strength to man thus upright and perfect god gave a perfect law to which he required full and perfect obedience he required full obedience in every point and this to be performed without any intermission from the moment man became a living soul till the time of his trial should be ended no allowance was made for any falling short as indeed there was no need of any man being altogether equal to the task assigned and thoroughly furnished for every good word and work to the entire law of love which was written in his heart against which perhaps he could not sin directly it seemed good to the sovereign wisdom of god to superadd one positive law thou shalt not eat of the fruit of the tree that groweth in the midst of the garden annexing that penalty thereto in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die such then was the state of man in paradise by the free unmerited love of god he was holy and happy he knew loved enjoyed god which is in substance life everlasting and in this life of love   he was to continue for ever if he continued to obey god in all things but if he disobeyed him in any he was to forfeit all in that day said god thou shalt surely die man did disobey god he ate of the tree of which god commanded him saying thou shalt not eat of it and in that day he was condemned by the righteous judgment of god then also the sentence whereof he was warned before began to take place upon him for the moment he tasted that fruit he died his soul died was separated from god separate from whom the soul has no more life than the body has when separate from the soul his body likewise became corruptible and mortal so that death then took hold on this also and being already dead in spirit dead to god dead in sin he hastened on to death everlasting to the destruction both of body and soul in the fire never to be quenched  thus by one man sin entered into the world and death by sin and so death passed upon all men as being contained in him who was the common father and representative of us all thus through the offence of one all are dead dead to god dead in sin dwelling in a corruptible mortal body shortly to be dissolved and under the sentence of death eternal for as by one mans disobedience all were made sinners so by that offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation romans v 12 c in this state we were even all mankind when god so loved the world that he gave his onlybegotten son to the end we might not perish but have everlasting life in the fullness of time he was made man another common head of mankind a second general parent and representative of the whole human race and as such it was that he bore ourgriefs the lord laying upon him the iniquities of us all then was he wounded for our transgressions and bruised for our iniquities he made his soul an offering for sin he poured out his blood for the transgressors he bare our sins in his own body on the tree that by his stripes we might be healed and by that one oblation of himself once offered he hath redeemed me and all mankind having thereby made a full perfect and sufficient sacrifice and satisfaction for the sins of the whole world in consideration of this that the son of god hath tasted death for every man god hath now reconciled the world to himself not imputing to them their former trespasses and thus as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification so that for the sake of his wellbeloved son of what he hath done and suffered for us god now vouchsafes on one only condition which himself also enables us to perform both to remit the punishment due to our sins to reinstate us in his favour and to restore our dead souls to spiritual life as the earnest of life eternal this therefore is the general ground of the whole doctrine of justification by the sin of the first adam who was not only the father but likewise the representative of us all we all fell short of the favour of god we all became children of wrath or as the apostle expresses it judgment came upon all men to condemnation even so by the sacrifice for sin made by the second adam as the representative of us all god is so far reconciled to all the world that he hath given them a new covenant the plain condition whereof being once fulfilled there is no more condemnation for us but we are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in jesus christ ii 1 but what is it to be justified what is justification this was the second thing which i proposed to show and it is evident from what has been already observed that it is not the being made actually just and righteous this is sanctification which is indeed in some degree the immediate fruit of justification but nevertheless is a distinct gift of god and of a totally different nature the one implies what god does for us through his son the other what he works in us by his spirit so that although some rare instances may be found wherein the term justified or justification is used in so wide a sense as to include sanctification also yet in general use they are sufficiently distinguished from each other both by st paul and the other inspired writers 2 neither is that farfetched conceit that justification is the clearing us from accusation particularly that of satan easily provable from any clear text of holy writ in the whole scriptural account of this matter as above laid down neither that accuser nor his accusation appears to be at all taken in it can not indeed be denied that he is the accuser of men emphatically so called but it does in nowise   appear that the great apostle hath any reference to this more or less in all he hath written touching justification either to the romans or thegalatians it is also far easier to take for granted than to prove from any clearscripture testimony that justification is the clearing us from the accusation brought against us by the law at least if this forced unnatural way of speaking mean either more or less than this that whereas we have transgressed the law of god and thereby deserved the damnation of hell god does not inflict on those who are justified the punishment which they had deserved least of all does justification imply that god is deceived in those whom he justifies that he thinks them to be what in fact they are not that he accounts them to be otherwise than they are it does by no means imply that god judges concerning us contrary to the real nature of things that he esteems us better than we really are or believes us righteous when we are unrighteous surely no the judgment of the allwise god is always according to truth neither can it ever consist with his unerring wisdom to think that i am innocent to judge that i am righteous or holy because another is so he can no more in this manner confound me with christ than with david orabraham let any man to whom god hath given understanding weigh this without prejudice and he cannot but perceive that such a notion of justification is neither reconcilable to reason nor scripture the plain scriptural notion of justification is pardon the forgiveness of sins it is that act of god the father hereby for the sake of the propitiation made by the blood of his son heshoweth forth his righteousness or mercy by the remission of the sins that are past this is the easy natural account of it given by st paul throughout this whole epistle so he explains it himself more particularly in this and in the following chapter thus in the next verses but one to the text blessed are they saith he whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered blessed is the man to whom the lord will not impute sin to him that is justified or forgiven god will not impute sin to his condemnation he will not condemn him on that account either in this world or in that which is to come his sins all his past sins in thought word and deed are covered are blotted out shall not be remembered or mentioned against him any more than if they had not been god will not inflict on that sinner what he deserved to suffer because the son of his love hath suffered for him and from the time we are accepted through the beloved reconciled to god through his blood he loves and blesses and watches over us for good even as if we had never sinned indeed the apostle in one place seems to extend the meaning of the word much farther where he says not the hearers of the law but the doers of the law shall be justified here he appears to refer our justification to the sentence of the great day and so our lord himself unquestionably doth when he says by thy words thou shalt be justified proving hereby that for every idle word men shall speak they shall give an account in the day of judgment but perhaps we can hardly produce another instance of st pauls using the word in that distant sense in the general tenor of his writings it is evident he doth not and least of all in the text before us which undeniably speaks not of those who have already finished their course but of those who are now just setting out just beginning to run the race which is set before them iii 1 but this is the third thing which was to be considered namely who are they that are justified and the apostle tells us expressly the ungodly he that is godjustifieth the ungodly the ungodly of every kind and degree and none but the ungodly as they that are righteous need no repentance so they need no forgiveness it is only sinners that have any occasion for pardon it is sin alone which admits of being forgiven forgiveness therefore has an immediate reference to sin and in this respect to nothing else it is our unrighteousness to which the pardoning god is merciful it is our iniquity which he remembereth no more 2 this seems not to be at all considered by those who so vehemently contend that a man must be sanctified that is holy before he can be justified especially by such of them as affirm that universal holiness or obedience must precede justification unless they mean that justification at the last day which is wholly out of the present question so far from it that the very supposition is not only flatly impossible for where there is no love of god there is no holiness and there is no love of god but from a sense of his loving us but also grossly intrinsically absurd contradictory to itself for it is not a saint but a sinner that is forgiven and under the notion of a sinner godjustifieth not the godly but   the ungodly not those that are holy already but the unholy upon what condition he doeth this will be considered quickly but whatever it is it cannot be holiness to assert this is to say the lamb of god takes away only those sins which were taken away before does then the good shepherd seek and save only those that are found already no he seeks and saves that which is lost he pardons those who need his pardoning mercy he saves from the guilt of sin and at the same time from the power sinners of every kind of every degree men who till then were altogether ungodly in whom the love of the father was not and consequently in whom dwelt no good thing no good or truly christian temper but all such as were evil and abominable  pride anger love of the world the genuine fruits of that carnal mind which is enmity against god  these who are sick the burden of whose sins is intolerable are they that need a physician these who are guilty who groan under the wrath of god are they that need a pardon these who are condemned already not only by god but also by their own conscience as by a thousand witnesses of all their ungodliness both in thought and word and work cry aloud for him that justifieth the ungodly through the redemption that is in jesus the ungodly and him thatworketh not that worketh not before he is justified anything that is good that is truly virtuous or holy but only evil continually for his heart is necessarily essentially evil till the love of god is shed abroad therein and while the tree is corrupt so are the fruits for an evil tree cannot bring forth good fruit if it be objected nay but a man before he is justified may feed the hungry or clothe the naked and these are good works the answer is easy he may do these even before he is justified and these are in one sense good works they are good and profitable to men but it does not follow that they are strictly speaking good in themselves or good in the sight of god all truly good works to use the words of our church follow after justification and they are therefore good and acceptable to god in christ because they spring out of a true and living faith by a parity of reason all works done before justification are not good in the christian sense forasmuch as they spring not of faith in jesus christ though from some kind of faith in god they may spring yea rather for that they are not done as god hath willed and commanded them to be done we doubt not how strange soever it may appear to some but they have the nature of sin perhaps those who doubt of this have not duly considered the weighty reason which is here assigned why no works done before justification can be truly and properly good the argument plainly runs thus  no works are good which are not done as god hath willed and commanded them to be done but no works done before justification are done as god hath willed and commanded them to be done therefore no works done before justification are good the first proposition is selfevident and the second that no works done before justification are done as god hath willed and commanded them to be done will appear equally plain and undeniable if we only consider god hath willed and commanded that all our works should be done in charity en agape in love in that love to god which produces love to all mankind but none of our works can be done in this love while the love of the father of god as our father is not in us and this love can not be in us till we receive the spirit of adoption crying in  our hearts abba father if therefore god doth not justify the ungodly and him that in this sense worketh not then hath christ died in vain then notwithstanding his death can no flesh living be justified iv 1 but on what terms then is he justified who is altogether ungodly and till that time worketh not on one alone which is faith he believeth is him thatjustifieth the ungodly and he that believeth is not condemned yea he is passed from death unto life for the righteousness or mercy of god is by faith of jesus christ unto all and upon all them that believe whom god hath set forth for a propitiation through faith in his blood that he might be just and consistently with his justice the justifier of him which believeth in jesus therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law without previous obedience to the moral law which   indeed he could not till now perform that it is the moral law and that alone which is here intended appears evidently from the words that follow do we then make void the law through faith god forbid yea we establish the law what law do we establish by faith not the ritual law not the ceremonial law of moses in nowise but the great unchangeable law of love the holy love of god and of our neighbour  faith in general is a divine supernatural elegchos evidence or conviction of things not seen not discoverable by our bodily senses as being either past future or spiritual justifying faith implies not only a divine evidence or conviction that god was in christ reconciling the world unto himself but a sure trust and confidence that christ died for my sins that he loved me and gave himself for me and at what time soever a sinner thus believes be it in early childhood in the strength of his years or when he is old and hoaryhaired godjustifieth that ungodly one god for the sake of his son pardoneth and absolveth him who had in him till then no good thing repentance indeed god had given him before but that repentance was neither more nor less than a deep sense of the want of all good and the presence of all evil and whatever good he hath or doeth from that hour when he first believes in god through christ faith does not find but bring this is the fruit of faith first the tree is good and then the fruit is good also i cannot describe the nature of this faith better than in the words of our own church the only instrument of salvation whereof justification is one branch is faith that is a sure trust and confidence that god both hath and will forgive our sins that he hath accepted us again into his favour for the merits of christs death and passion but here we must take heed that we do not halt with god through an inconstant wavering faith peter coming to christ upon the water because he fainted in faith was in danger of drowning so we if we begin to waver or doubt it is to be feared that we shall sink as peter did not into the water but into the bottomless pit of hell fire second sermon on the passion  therefore have a sure and constant faith not only that the death of christ is available for all the world but that he hath made a full and sufficient sacrifice for thee a perfect cleansing of thy sins so that thou mayest say with the apostle he loved thee and gave himself for thee for this is to make christ thine own and to apply his merits unto thyself sermon on the sacrament first part  by affirming that this faith is the term or condition of justification i mean first that there is no justification without it he that believeth not is condemned already and so long as he believeth not that condemnation cannot be removed but the wrath of godabideth on him as there is no other name given under heaven than that of jesus ofnazareth no other merit whereby a condemned sinner can ever be saved from the guilt of sin so there is no other way of obtaining a share in his merit than by faith in his name so that as long as we are without this faith we are strangers to the covenant of promise we are aliens from the commonwealth of israel and without god in the world whatsoever virtues so called a man may have i speak of those unto whom the gospel is preached for what have i to do to judge them that are without whatsoever good works so accounted he may do it profiteth not he is still a child of wrath still under the curse till he believes in jesus  faith therefore is the necessary condition of justification yea and the only necessary condition thereof this is the second point carefully to be observed that the very moment godgiveth faith for it is the gift of god to the ungodly that worketh not that faith is counted to him for righteousness he hath no righteousness at all antecedent to this not so much as negative righteousness or innocence but faith is imputed to him for righteousness the very moment that he believeth not that god as was observed beforethinketh him to be what he is not but as he made christ to be sin for us that is treated him as a sinner punishing him for our sins so hecounteth us righteous from the time we believe in him that is he doth not punish us for our sins yea treats us as though we are guiltless and righteous  surely the difficulty of assenting to this proposition that faith is the only condition of justification must arise from not understanding it we mean thereby thus much that it is the only thing without which none is justified the only thing that is immediately indispensably absolutely   requisite in order to pardon as on the one hand though a man should have every thing else without faith yet he cannot be justified so on the other though he be supposed to want everything else yet if he hath faith he cannot but be justified for suppose a sinner of any kind or degree in a full sense of his total ungodliness of his utter inability to think speak or do good and his absolutemeetness for hellfire suppose i say this sinner helpless and hopeless casts himself wholly on the mercy of god in christ which indeed he cannot do but by the grace of god who can doubt but he is forgiven in that moment who will affirm that any more is indispensably required before that sinner can be justified  now if there ever was one such instance from the beginning of the world and have there not been and are there not ten thousand times ten thousand it plainly follows that faith is in the above sense the sole condition of justification it does not become poor guilty sinful worms who receive whatsoever blessings they enjoy from the least drop of water that cools our tongue to the immense riches of glory in eternity of grace of mere favour and not of debt to ask of god the reasons of his conduct it is not meet for us to call him in question who giveth account to none of his ways to demand why didst thou make faith the condition the only condition of justification wherefore didst thou decree he that believeth and he only shall be saved this is the very point on which st paul so strongly insists in the ninth chapter of this epistle viz that the terms of pardon and acceptance must depend not on us but on him that calleth us that there is no unrighteousness with god in fixing his own terms not according to ours but his own good pleasure who may justly say i will have mercy on whom i will have mercy namely on him who believeth in jesus so then it is not of him thatwilleth nor of him that runneth to choose the condition on which he shall find acceptance but of god thatshoweth mercy that accepteth none at all but of his own free love his unmerited goodness therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy viz on those who believe on the son of his love and whom he will that is those who believe not hehardeneth leaves at last to the hardness of their hearts one reason however we may humbly conceive of gods fixing this condition of justification if thou believest in the lord jesus christ thou shalt be saved was to hide pride from man pride had already destroyed the very angels of god had cast down a third part of the stars of heaven it was likewise in great measure owing to this when the tempter said ye shall be as gods that adam fell from his own steadfastness and brought sin and death into the world it was therefore an instance of wisdom worthy of god to appoint such a condition of reconciliation for him and all his posterity as might effectually humble might abase them to the dust and such is faith it is peculiarly fitted for this end for he that cometh unto god by this faith must fix his eye singly on his own wickedness on his guilt and helplessness without having the least regard to any supposed good in himself to any virtue or righteousness whatsoever he must come as a mere sinner inwardly and outwardly selfdestroyed and selfcondemned bringing nothing to god but ungodliness only pleading nothing of his own but sin and misery thus it is and thus alone when his mouth is stopped and he stands utterly guilty before god that he can look unto jesus as the whole and sole propitiation for his sins thus only can he be found in him and receive the righteousness which is of god by faith thou ungodly one whohearest or readest these words thou vile helpless miserable sinner i charge thee before god the judge of all go straight unto him with all thy ungodliness take heed thou destroy not thy own soul by pleading thy righteousness more or less go as altogether ungodly guilty lost destroyed deserving and dropping into hell and thou shalt then find favour in his sight and know that he justifieth the ungodly as such thou shalt be brought unto the blood of sprinkling as an undone helpless damned sinner thus look unto jesus there is the lamb of god who taketh away thy sins plead thou no works no righteousness of thine own no humility contrition sincerity in nowise that were in very deed to deny the lord that bought thee no plead thou singly the blood of the covenant the ransom paid for thy proud stubborn sinful soul who art thou that now seest and feelest both thine inward and outward ungodliness thou art the man i want thee for my lord i challenge thee for a child of god by faith the lord hath need of thee thou who feelest thou art just fit for hell art just fit to advance his glory the glory of his free grace justifying the ungodly and him that worketh not o come quickly believe in the lord jesus and thou even thou art reconciled to god   sermon 6 text from the 1872 edition the righteousness of faith moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law that the man which doeth those things shall live by them but the righteousness which is of faithspeaketh on this wise say not in thine heart who shall ascend into heaven that is to bring christ down from above or who shall descend into the deep that is to bring up christ again from the dead but what saith it the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth and in thy heart that is the word of faith which we preachrom 1058 the apostle does not here oppose the covenant given bymoses to the covenant given by christ if we ever imagined this it was for want of observing that the latter as well as the former part of these words were spoken bymoses himself to the people of israel and that concerning the covenant which then was deut 3011 12 14 but it is the covenant of grace which god through christ hath established with men in all ages as well before and under the jewish dispensation as since god was manifest in the flesh which st paul here opposes to the covenant of works made with adam while in paradise hut commonly supposed to be the only covenant which god had made with man particularly by those jews of whom the apostle writes of these it was that he so affectionately speaks in the beginfling of this chapter my hearts desire and prayer to god for israel is that they may be saved for i bear them record that they have a zeal for god but not according to knowledge for they being ignorant of gods righteousness of the justification that flows from his mere grace and mercy freely forgiving our sins through the son of his love through the redemption which is in jesus and seeking to establish their own righteousness their own holiness antecedent to faith in him that justifieth the ungodly as the ground of their pardon and acceptance have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of god and consequently seek death in the error of their life they were ignorant that christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth  that by the oblation of himself once offered he had put an end to the first law or covenant which indeed was not given by god tomoses but to adam in his state of innocence the strict tenor whereof without any abatement was do this and live and at the same time purchased for us that better covenant believe and live believe and thou shalt be saved now saved both from the guilt and power of sin and of consequence from the wages of it and how many are equally ignorant now even among those who are called by the name of christ how many who have now a zeal for god yet have it not according to knowledge but are still seeking to establish their own righteousness as the ground of their pardon and acceptance and therefore vehemently refuse to submit themselves unto the righteousness of god surely my hearts desire and prayer to god for you brethren is that ye may be saved and in order to remove this grand stumblingblock out of your way i will endeavour to show first what the righteousness is which is of the law and what the righteousness which is of faith secondly the folly of trusting in the righteousness of the law and the wisdom of submitting to that which is of faith i 1 and first the righteousness which is of the law saith the man which doeth these things shall live by them constantly and perfectly observe all these things to do them and then thou shalt live for ever this law or covenant usually called the covenant of works given by god to man in paradise required an obedience perfect in all its parts entire and wanting nothing as the condition of his eternal continuance in the holiness and happiness wherein he was created 2 it required that man should fulfil all righteousness inward and outward negative and positive that he should not only abstain from every idle word and avoid every evil work but should keep every affection every desire every thought in obedience to the will of god that he should continue holy as he which had created him was holy both in heart and in all manner of conversation that he should be pure in heart even as god is pure perfect as his father in heaven was perfect that he   should love the lord his god with all his heart with all his soul with all his mind and with all his strength that he should love every soul which god had made even as god had loved him that by this universal benevolence he should dwell in god who is love and god in him that he should serve the lord his god with all his strength and in all things singly aim at his glory these were the things which the righteousness of the law required that he who did them might live thereby but it farther required that this entire obedience to god this inward and outward holiness this conformity both of heart and life to his will should be perfect in degree no abatement no allowance could possibly be made for falling short in any degree as to any jot or tittle either of the outward or the inward law if every commandment relating to outward things was obeyed yet that was not sufficient unless every one was obeyed with all the strength in the highest measure and most perfect manner nor did it answer the demand of this covenant to love god with every power and faculty unless he were loved with the full capacity of each with the whole possibility of the soul one thing more was indispensably required by the righteousness of the law namely that this universal obedience this perfect holiness both of heart and life should be perfectly uninterrupted also should continue without any intermission from the moment wherein god created man and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life until the days of his trial should be ended and he should be confirmed in life everlasting the righteousness then which is of the lawspeaketh on this wise thou o man of god stand fast in love in the image of god wherein thou art made if thou wilt remain in life keep the commandments which are now written in thy heart love the lord thy god with all thy heart love as thyself every soul that he hath made desire nothing but god aim at god in every thought in every word and work swerve not in one motion of body or soul from him thy mark and the prize of thy high calling and let all that is in thee praise his holy name every power and faculty of thy soul in every kind in every degree and at every moment of thine existence this do and thou shalt live thy light shall shine thy love shall flame more and more till thou art received up into the house of god in the heavens to reign with him for ever and ever but the righteousness which is of faithspeaketh on this wise say not in thine heart who shall ascend into heaven that is to bring down christ from above as though it were some impossible task which god required thee previously to perform in order to thine acceptance or who shall descend into the deep that is to bring up christ from the dead as though that were still remaining to be done for the sake of which thou wert to be accepted but what saith it the word according to the tenor of which thou mayest now be accepted as an heir of life eternal is nigh thee even in thy mouth and in thy heart that is the word of faith which we preach  the new covenant which god hath now established with sinful man through christ jesus by the righteousness which is of faith is meant that condition of justification and in consequence of present and final salvation if we endure therein unto the end which was given by god to fallen man through the merits and mediation of his onlybegotten son this was in part revealed to adam soon after his fall being contained in the original promise made to him and his seed concerning the seed of the woman who should bruise the serpents head gen 315 it was a little more clearly revealed to abraham by the angel of god from heaven saying by myself have i sworn saith the lord that in thy seed shall all the nations of the world be blessed gen 1215 18 it was yet more fully made known tomoses to david and to the prophets that followed and through them to many of the people of god in their respective generations but still the bulk even of these were ignorant of it and very few understood it clearly still life and immortality were not so brought to light to the jews of old as they are now unto us by the gospel now this covenant saith not to sinful man performunsinning obedience and live if this were the term he would have no more benefit by all which christ hath done and suffered for him than if he was required in order to life to ascend into heaven and bring down christ from above or to descend into the deep into the invisible world and bring up christ from the dead it doth not require any impossibility to be done although to mere man what it requires would be impossible but not to man assisted by the spirit of god this were only to mock human weakness indeed strictly speaking the covenant of grace doth not require us to do anything at all as absolutely and   indispensably necessary in order to our justification but only to believe in him who for the sake of his son and the propitiation which he hath made justifieth the ungodly that worketh not and imputes his faith to him for righteousness even soabraham believed in the lord and he counted it to him for righteousness gen 156 and he received the sign of circumcision a seal of the righteousness of faith  that he might be the father of all them that believe  that righteousness might be imputed unto them also rom 411 now it was not written for his sake alone that it ie faith was imputed to him but for us also to whom it shall be imputed to whom faith shall be imputed for righteousness shall stand in the stead of perfect obedience in order to our acceptance with god if we believe on him who raised up jesus our lord from the dead who was delivered to death for our offences and was raised again for our justification rom 42325 for the assurance of the remission of our sins and of a second life to come to them that believe what saith then the covenant of forgiveness of unmerited love of pardoning mercy believe in the lord jesus christ and thou shalt be saved in the day thoubelievest thou shalt surely live thou shalt be restored to the favour of god and in his pleasure is life thou shalt be saved from the curse and from the wrath of god thou shalt be quickened from the death of sin into the life of righteousness and if thou endure to the end believing in jesus thou shalt never taste the second death but having suffered with thy lord shalt also live and reign with him for ever and ever now this word is nigh thee this condition of life is plain easy always at hand it is in thy mouth and in thy heart through the operation of the spirit of god the moment thoubelievest in thine heart in him whom god hath raised from the dead and confessest with thy mouth the lord jesus as thy lord and thy god thou shalt be saved from condemnation from the guilt and punishment of thy former sins and shalt have power to serve god in true holiness all the remaining days of thy life what is the difference then between the righteousness which is of the law and the righteousness which is of faith   between the first covenant or the covenant of works and the second the covenant of grace the essential unchangeable difference is this the one supposes him to whom it is given to be already holy and happy created in the image and enjoying the favour of god and prescribes the condition whereon he may continue therein in love and joy life and immortality the other supposes him to whom it is given to be now unholy and unhappy fallen short of the glorious image of god having the wrath of god abiding on him and hastening through sin whereby his soul is dead to bodily death and death everlasting and to man in this state it prescribes the condition whereon he may regain the pearl he has lost may recover the favour and image of god may retrieve the life of god in his soul and be restored to the knowledge and the love of god which is the beginning of life eternal  again the covenant of works in order to mans continuance in the favour of god in his knowledge and love in holiness and happiness required of perfect man a perfect and uninterrupted obedience to every point of the law of god whereas the covenant of grace in order to mans recovery of the favour and the life of god requires only faith living faith in him who through god justifies him that obeyed not yet again the covenant of works required of adam and all his children to pay the price themselves in consideration of which they were to receive all the future blessings of god but in the covenant of grace seeing we have nothing to pay god frankly forgives us all provided only that we believe in him who hath paid the price for us who hath given himself a propitiation for our sins for the sins of the whole world thus the first covenant required what is now afar off from all the children of men namely unsinning obedience which is far from those who are conceived and born in sin whereas the second requires what is nigh at hand as though it should say thou art sin god is love thou by sin art fallen short of the glory of god yet there is mercy with him bring then all thy sins to the pardoning god and they shall vanish away as a cloud if thou wert not ungodly there would be no room for him to justify thee as ungodly but now draw near in fill assurance of faith hespeaketh and it is done fear not only believe for even the just godjustifieth all that believe in jesus   ii 1 these things considered it would be easy to show as i proposed to do in the second place the folly of trusting in the righteousness which is of the law and the wisdom of submitting to the righteousness which is of faith the folly of those who still trust in the righteousness which is of the law the terms of which are do this and live may abundantly appear from hence they set out wrong their very first step is a fundamental mistake for before they can ever think of claiming any blessing on the terms of this covenant they must suppose themselves to be in his state with whom this covenant was made but how vain a supposition is this since it was made with adam in a state of innocence how weak therefore must that whole building be which stands on such a foundation and how foolish are they who thus build on the sand who seem never to have considered that the covenant of works was not given to man when he was dead in trespasses and sins but when he was alive to god when he knew no sin but was holy as god is holy who forget that it was never designed for the recovery of the favour and life of god once lost but only for the continuance and increase thereof till it should be complete in life everlasting  neither do they consider who are thus seeking to establish their own righteousness which is of the law what manner of obedience or righteousness that is which the law indispensably requires it must be perfect and entire in every point or it answers not the demand of the law but which of you is able to perform such obedience or consequently to live thereby who among you fulfils every jot and tittle even of the outward commandments of god doing nothing great or small which god forbids leaving nothing undone which he enjoins speaking no idle word having your conversation always meet to minister grace to the hearers and whether you eat or drink or whatever you do doing all to the glory of god and how much less are you able to fulfil all the inward commandments of god those which require that every temper and motion of your soul should be holiness unto the lord are you able to love god with all your heart to love all mankind as your own soul to pray without ceasing in every thing to give thanks to have god always before you and to keep every affection desire and thought in obedience to his law you should farther consider that the righteousness of the law requires not only the obeying every command of god negative and positive internal and external but likewise in the perfect degree in every instance whatever the voice of the law is thou shalt serve the lord thy god with all thy strength it allows no abatement of any kind it excuses no defect it condemns every coming short of the full measure of obedience and immediately pronounces a curse on the offender it regards only the invariable rules of justice and saith i know not to show mercy who then can appear before such a judge who is extreme to mark what is done amiss how weak are they who desire to be tried at the bar where no flesh living can be justified  none of the offspring of adam for suppose we did now keep every commandment with all our strength yet one single breach which ever was utterly destroys our whole claim to life if we have ever offended in any one point this righteousness is at an end for the law condemns all who do not perform uninterrupted as well as perfect obedience so that according to the sentence of this for him who hath once sinned in any degree there remaineth only a fearful looking for of fiery indignation which shall devour the adversaries of god  is it not then the very foolishness of folly for fallen man to seek life by this righteousness for man who was shapen in wickedness and in sin did his mother conceive him man who is by nature all earthly sensual devilish altogether corrupt and abominable in whom till he find grace dwelleth no good thing nay who cannot of himself think one good thought who is indeed all sin a mere lump of ungodliness and who commits sin in every breath he draws whose actual transgressions in word and deed are more in number than the hairs of his head what stupidity what senselessness must it be for such an unclean guilty helpless worm as this to dream of seeking acceptance by his own righteousness of living by the righteousness which is of the law now whatsoever considerations prove the folly of trusting in the righteousness which is of the law prove equally the wisdom of submitting to the righteousness which is of god by faith this were easy to be shown with regard to each of the preceding considerations but to wave this the wisdom of the first step hereto the disclaiming our own righteousness plainly appears from hence   that it is acting according to truth to the real nature of things for what is it more than to acknowledge with our heart as well as lips the true state wherein we are to acknowledge that we bring with us into the world a corrupt sinful nature more corrupt indeed than we can easily conceive or find words to express that hereby we are prone to all that is evil and averse from all that is good that we are full of pride self will unruly passions foolish desires vile and inordinate affections lovers of the world lovers of pleasure more than lovers of god that our lives have been no better than our hearts but many ways ungodly and unholy insomuch that our actual sins both in word and deed have been as the stars of heaven for multitude that on all these accounts we are displeasing to him who is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity and deserve nothing from him but indignation and wrath and death the due wages of sin that we cannot by any of our righteousness for indeed we have none at all nor by any of our works for they are as the tree upon which they grow appease the wrath of god or avert the punishment we have justly deserved yea that if left to ourselves we shall only wax worse and worse sink deeper and deeper into sin offend god more and more both with our evil works and with the evil tempers of our carnal mind till we fill up the measure of our iniquities and bring upon ourselves swift destruction and is not this the very state wherein by nature we are to acknowledge this then both with our heart and lips that is to disclaim our own righteousness the righteousness which is of the law is to act according to the real nature of things and consequently is an instance of true wisdom  the wisdom of submitting to the righteousness of faith appears farther from this consideration that it is the righteousness of god i mean here it is that method of reconciliation with god which hath been chosen and established by god himself not only as he is the god of wisdom but as he is the sovereign lord of heaven and earth and of every creature which he hath made now as it is not meet for man to say unto god what doest thou  as none who is not utterly void of understanding will contend with one that is mightier than he with him whose kingdomruleth over all so it is true wisdom it is a mark of sound understanding to acquiesce in whatever he hath chosen to say in this as in all things it is the lord let him do what seemeth him good it may be farther considered that it was of mere grace of free love of undeserved mercy that god hath vouchsafed to sinful man any way of reconciliation with himself that we were not cut away from his hand and utterly blotted out of his remembrance therefore whatever method he is pleased to appoint of his tender mercy of his unmerited goodness whereby his enemies who have so deeply revolted from him so long and obstinately rebelled against him may still find favour in his sight it is doubtless our wisdom to accept it with all thankfulness to mention but one consideration more it is wisdom to aim at the best end by the best means now the best end which any creature can pursue is happiness in god and the best end a fallen creature can pursue is the recovery of the favour and image of god but the best indeed the only means under heaven given to a man whereby he may regain the favour of god which is better than life itself or the image of god which is the true life of the soul is the submitting to the righteousness which is of faith the believing in the onlybegotten son of god iii 1 whosoever therefore thou art whodesirest to be forgiven and reconciled to the favour of god do not say in thy heart i must first do this i must first conquer every sin break off every evil word and work and do all good to all men or i must first go to church receive the lords supper hear more sermons and say more prayers alas my brother thou art clean gone out of the way thou art still ignorant of the righteousness of god and art seeking to establish thy own righteousness as the ground of thy reconciliationknowest thou not that thou canst do nothing but sin till thou art reconciled to god wherefore then dost thou say i must do this and this first and then i shall believe nay but first believe believe in the lord jesus christ the propitiation for thy sins let this good foundation first be laid and then thou shalt do all things well 2 neither say in thy heart i cannot be accepted yet because i am not good enough who is good enough  who ever was  to merit acceptance at gods hands was ever any child of adam good enough for this or will any till the consummation of all things and as for thee thou art not good at all there dwelleth in thee no good thing and thou never wilt be till thou believe in jesus rather thou wilt find thyself worse and worse but is there any need of being worse in order to be accepted art thou not bad enough already indeed thou art and that godknoweth and thou thyself canst not   deny it then delay not all things are now ready arise and wash away thy sins the fountain is open now is the time to wash thee white in the blood of the lamb now he shall purge thee as with hyssop and thou shalt be clean he shall wash thee and thou shalt be whiter than snow 3 do not say but i am not contrite enough i am not sensible enough of my sins i know it i would to god thou wert more sensible of them more contrite a thousand fold than thou art but do not stay for this it may be god will make thee so not before thoubelievest but by believing it may be thou wilt not weep much till thou lovest much because thou hast had much forgiven in the mean time look unto jesus behold how heloveth thee what could he have done more for thee which he hath not done  o lamb of god was ever pain was ever love like thine look steadily upon him till he looks on thee and breaks thy hard heart then shall thy head be waters and thy eyes fountains of tears nor yet do thou say i must do something more before i come to christ i grant supposing thy lord should delay his coming it were meet and right to wait for his appearing in doing so far as thou hast power whatsoever he hath commanded thee but there is no necessity for making such a supposition howknowest thou that he will delay perhaps he will appear as the dayspring from on high before the morning light o do not set him a time expect him every hour now he is nigh even at the door  and to what end wouldest thou wait for more sincerity before thy sins are blotted out to make thee more worthy of the grace of god alas thou art still establishing thy own righteousness he will have mercy not because thou art worthy of it but because his compassions fail not not because thou art righteous but because jesus christ hath atoned for thy sins again if there be anything good in sincerity why dost thou expect it before thou hast faith  seeing faith itself is the only root of whatever is really good and holy above all how long wilt thou forget that whatsoever thou doest or whatsoever thou hast before thy sins are forgiven thee it avails nothing with god toward the procuring of thy forgiveness yea and that it must all be cast behind thy back trampled under foot made no account of or thou wilt never find favour in gods sight because until then thou canst not ask it as a mere sinner guilty lost undone having nothing to plead nothing to offer to god but only the merits of his wellbeloved son who loved thee and gave himself for thee 6 to conclude whosoever thou art o man who hast the sentence of death in thyself whofeelest thyself a condemned sinner and hast the wrath of god abiding on thee unto thee saith the lord not do this  perfectly obey all my commands  and live but believe in the lord jesus christ and thou shalt be saved the word of faith is nigh unto thee now at this instant in the present moment and in thy present state sinner as thou art just as thou art believe the gospel and i will be merciful unto thy unrighteousness and thy iniquities will i remember no more   sermon 7 text from the 1872 edition the way to the kingdom the kingdom of god is at hand repent ye and believe the gospel mark 115 these words naturally lead us to consider first the nature of true religion here termed by our lord the kingdom of god which saith he is at hand and secondly the way thereto which he points out in those words repent ye and believe the gospel i 1 we are first to consider the nature of true religion here termed by our lord the kingdom of god the same expression the great apostle uses in his epistle to the romans where he likewise explains his lords words saying the kingdom of god is not meat and drink but righteousness and peace and joy in the holy ghost rom 1417 the kingdom of god or true religion is not meat and drink it is well known that not only the unconverted jews but great numbers of those who had received the faith of christ were notwithstanding zealous of the law acts 2120 even the ceremonial law ofmoses whatsoever therefore they found written therein either concerning meat and drink offerings or the distinction between clean and unclean meats they not only observed themselves but vehemently pressed the same even on those among the gentiles or heathens who were turned to god yea to such a degree that some of them taught wheresoever they came among them except ye be circumcised and keep the law the whole ritual law ye cannot be saved acts 151 24 in opposition to these the apostle declares both here and in many other places that true religion does not consist in meat and drink or in any ritual observances nor indeed in any outward thing whatever in anything exterior to the heart the whole substance thereof lying in righteousness peace and joy in the holy ghost not in any outward thing such as forms or ceremonies even of the most excellent kind supposing these to be ever so decent and significant ever so expressive of inward things supposing them ever so helpful not only to the vulgar whose thought reaches little farther than their sight but even to men of understanding men of strong capacities as doubtless they may sometimes be yea supposing them as in the case of the jews to be appointed by god himself yet even during the period of time wherein that appointment remains in force true religion does not principally consist therein nay strictly speaking not at all how much more must this hold concerning such rites and forms as are only of human appointment the religion of christ rises infinitely higher and lies immensely deeper than all these these are good in their place just so far as they are in fact subservient to true religion and it were superstition to object against them while they are applied only as occasional helps to human weakness but let no man carry them farther let no man dream that they have any intrinsic worth or that religion cannot subsist without them this were to make them an abomination to the lord the nature of religion is so far from consisting in these in forms of worship or rites and ceremonies that it does not properly consist in any outward actions of what kind so ever it is true a man cannot have any religion who is guilty of vicious immoral actions or who does to others what he would not they should do to him if he were in the same circumstance and it is also true that he can have no real religion who knows to do good and doth it not yet may a man both abstain from outward evil and do good and still have no religion yea two persons may do the same outward work suppose feeding the hungry or clothing the naked and in the meantime one of these may be truly religious and the other have no religion at all for the one may act from the love of god and the other from the love of praise so manifest it is that although true religion naturally leads to every good word and work yet the real nature thereof lies deeper still even in the hidden man of the heart   i say of the heart for neither does religion consist orthodoxy or right opinions which although they are not properly outward things are not in the heart but the understanding a man may be orthodox in every point he may not only espouse right opinions but zealously defend them against all opposers he may think justly concerning the incarnation of our lord concerning the everblessed trinity and every other doctrine contained in the oracles of god he may assent to all the three creeds  that called the apostles the nicene and the athanasian and yet it is possible he may have no religion at all no more than a jew turk or pagan he may be almost as orthodox  as the devil though indeed not altogether for every man errs in something whereas we cant well conceive him to hold any erroneous opinion and may all the while be as great a stranger as he to the religion of the heart this alone is religion truly so called this alone is in the sight of god of great price the apostle sums it all up in three particulars righteousness and peace and joy in the holy ghost and first righteousness we cannot be at a loss concerning this if we remember the words of our lord describing the two grand branches thereof on which hang all the law and the prophets thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy mind and with all thy soul and with all thy strength this is the first and great commandment mark 1230 the first and great branch of christian righteousness thou shalt delight thyself in the lord thy god thou shalt seek and find all happiness in him he shall be thy shield and thy exceeding great reward in time and in eternity all thy bones shall say whom have i in heaven but thee and there is none upon earth that i desire beside thee thou shalt hear and fulfil his word who saith my son give me thy heart and having given him thy heart thy inmost soul to reign there without a rival thou mayest well cry out in the fullness of thy heart i will love thee o lord my strength the lord is my strong rock and my defence my saviour my god and my might in whom i will trust my buckler the horn also of my salvation and my refuge  and the second commandment is like unto this the second great branch of christian righteousness is closely and inseparably connected therewith even thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself thou shalt love  thou shalt embrace with the most tender goodwill the most earnest and cordial affection the most inflamed desires of preventing or removing all evil and of procuring for him every possible good  thy neighbour  that is not only thy friend thy kinsman or thy acquaintance not only the virtuous the friendly him that loves thee that prevents or returns thy kindness but every child of man every human creature every soul which god hath made not excepting him whom thou never hast seen in the flesh whom thouknowest not either by face or name not excepting him whom thou knowest to be evil and unthankful him that still despitefully uses and persecutes thee him thou shalt love as thyself with the same invariable thirst after his happiness in every kind the same unwearied care to screen him from whatever might grieve or hurt either his soul or body now is not this love the fulfilling of the law the sum of all christian righteousness  of all inward righteousness for it necessarily implies bowels of mercies humbleness of mind seeing love is not puffed up gentleness meekness longsuffering for love is not provoked but believeth hopeth endureth all things and of all outward righteousness for loveworketh no evil to his neighbour either by word or deed it cannot willingly hurt or grieve any one and it is zealous of good works every lover of mankind as he hath opportunity doth good unto all men being without partiality and without hypocrisy full of mercy and good fruits but true religion or a heart right toward god and man implies happiness as well as holiness for it is not only righteousness but also peace and joy in the holy ghost what peace the peace of god which god only can give and the world cannot take away the peace whichpasseth all understanding all barely rational conception being a supernatural sensation a divine taste of the powers of the world to come such as the natural manknoweth not how wise soever in the things of this world nor indeed can he know it in his present state because it is spiritually discerned it is a peace that banishes all doubt all painful uncertainty the spirit of god bearing witness with the spirit of a christian that he is a child of god and it banishes fear all such fear as hath torment the fear of the wrath of god the fear of hell the fear of the devil and in particular the fear of death he that hath the peace of god desiring if it were the will of god to depart and to be with christ   with this peace of god wherever it is fixed in the soul there is also joy in the holy ghost joy wrought in the heart by the holy ghost by the everblessed spirit of god he it is thatworketh in us that calm humble rejoicing in god through christ jesus by whom we have now received the atonement katallagen the reconciliation with god and that enables us boldly to confirm the truth of the royal psalmists declaration blessed is the man or rather happy whose unrighteousness is forgiven and whose sin is covered he it is that inspires the christian soul with that even solid joy which arises from the testimony of the spirit that he is a child of god and that gives him to rejoice with joy unspeakable in hope of the glory of god hope both of the glorious image of god which is in part and shall be fully revealed in him and of that crown of glory whichfadeth not away reserved in heaven for him  this holiness and happiness joined in one are sometimes styled in the inspired writings the kingdom of god as by our lord in the text and sometimes the kingdom of heaven it is termed the kingdom of god because it is the immediate fruit of gods reigning in the soul so soon as ever he takes unto himself his mighty power and sets up his throne in our hearts they are instantly filled with this righteousness and peace and joy in the holy ghost it is called the kingdom of heaven because it is in a degree heaven opened in the soul for whosoever they are that experience this they can aver before angels and men everlasting life is won glory is on earth begun according to the constant tenor of scripture which everywhere bears record god hath given unto us eternal life and this life is in his son he that hath the son reigning in his heart hath life even life everlasting 1 john 511 12 for this is life eternal to know thee the only true god and jesus christ whom thou hast sent john 173 and they to whom this is given may confidently address god though they were in the midst of a fiery furnace thee lord safe shielded by thy power thee son of god jehovah we adore in form of man descending to appear to thee be ceaseless hallelujahs given praise as in heaven thy throne we offer here for where thy presence is displayd is heaven 13 and this kingdom of god or of heaven is at hand as these words were originally spoken they implied that the time was then fulfilled god being made manifest in the flesh when he would set up his kingdom among men and reign in the hearts of his people and is not the time now fulfilled for lo saith he i am with you always you who preach remission of sins in my name even unto the end of the world matt 2820 wheresoever therefore the gospel of christ is preached this his kingdom is nigh at hand it is not far from every one of you ye may this hour enter thereinto if so be ye hearken to his voice repent ye and believe the gospel ii 1 this is the way walk ye in it and first repent that is know yourselves this is the first repentance previous to faith even conviction or selfknowledge awake then thou thatsleepest know thyself to be a sinner and what manner of sinner thou art know that corruption of thy inmost nature whereby thou art very far gone from original righteousness whereby the fleshlusteth always contrary to the spirit through that carnal mind which is enmity against god which is not subject to the law of god neither indeed can be know that thou art corrupted in every power in every faculty of thy soul that thou art totally corrupted in every one of these all the foundations being out of course the eyes of thine understanding are darkened so that they cannot discern god or the things of god the clouds of ignorance and error rest upon thee and cover thee with the shadow of   death thou knowest nothing yet as thououghtest to know neither god nor the world nor thyself thy will is no longer the will of god but is utterly perverse and distorted averse from all good from all which god loves and prone to all evil to every abomination which godhateth thy affections are alienated from god and scattered abroad over all the earth all thy passions both thy desires and aversions thy joys and sorrows thy hopes and fears are out of frame are either undue in their degree or placed on undue objects so that there is no soundness in thy soul but from the crown of the head to the sole of the foot to use the strong expression of the prophet there are only wounds and bruises and putrefying sores such is the inbred corruption of thy heart of thy very inmost nature and what manner of branches canst thou expect to grow from such an evil root hence springs unbelief ever departing from the living god saying who is the lord that i should serve him tush thou godcarest not for it hence independence affecting to be like the most high hence pride in all its forms teaching thee to say i am rich and increased in goods and have need of nothing from this evil fountain flow forth the bitter streams of vanity thirst of praise ambition covetousness the lust of the flesh the lust of the eye and the pride of life from this arise anger hatred malice revenge envy jealousy evil surmisings from this all the foolish and hurtful lusts that now pierce thee through with many sorrows and if not timely prevented will at length drown thy soul in everlasting perdition and what fruits can grow on such branches as these only such as are bitter and evil continually of pride cometh contention vain boasting seeking and receiving praise of men and so robbing god of that glory which he cannot give unto another of the lust of the flesh come gluttony or drunkenness luxury or sensuality fornicationuncleanness variously defiling that body which was designed for a temple of the holy ghost of unbelief every evil word and work but the time would fail shouldst thou reckon up all all the idle words thou hast spoken provoking the most high grieving the holy one of israel all the evil works thou hast done either wholly evil in themselves or at least not done to the glory of god for thy actual sins are more than thou art able to express more than the hairs of thy head who can number the sands of the sea or the drops of rain or thy iniquities  and knowest thou not that the wages of sin is death  death not only temporal but eternal the soul that sinneth it shall die for the mouth of the lord hath spoken it it shall die the second death this is the sentence to be punished with neverending death with everlasting destruction from the presence of the lord and from the glory of his powerknowest thou not that every sinner enochos estai eis ten geennan tou pyros not properly is in danger of hellfire is far too weak but rather is under the sentence of hellfire doomed already just dragging to execution thou art guilty of everlasting death it is the just reward of thy inward and outward wickedness it is just that the sentence should now take place dost thou see dost thou feel this art thou thoroughly convinced that thou deservest gods wrath and everlasting damnation would god do thee no wrong if he now commanded the earth to open and swallow thee up if thou wert now to go down quick into the pit into the fire that never shall be quenched if god hath given thee truly to repent thou hast a deep sense that these things are so and that it is of his mere mercy thou art not consumed swept away from the face of the earth  and what wilt thou do to appease the wrath of god to atone for all thy sins and to escape the punishment thou hast so justly deserved alas thou canst do nothing nothing that will in anywise make amends to god for one evil work or word or thought if thou couldst now do all things well if from this very hour till thy soul should return to god thou couldst perform perfect uninterrupted obedience even this would not atone for what is past the not increasing thy debt would not discharge it it would still remain as great as ever yea the present and future obedience of all the men upon earth and all the angels in heaven would never make satisfaction to the justice of god for one single sin how vain then was the thought of atoning for thy own sins by anything thoucouldest do it costeth far more to redeem one soul than all mankind is able to pay so that were there no other help for a guilty sinner without doubt he must have perished everlastingly but suppose perfect obedience for the time to come could atone for the sins that are past this would profit thee nothing for thou art not able to perform it no not in any one point begin now make the trial shake off that outward sin that so easilybesetteth thee thou canst not how then wilt   thou change thy life from all evil to all good indeed it is impossible to be done unless first thy heart be changed for so long as the tree remains evil it cannot bring forth good fruit but art thou able to change thy own heart from all sin to all holiness to quicken a soul that is dead in sin  dead to god and alive only to the world no more than thou art able to quicken a dead body to raise to life him that lieth in the grave yea thou art not able to quicken thy soul in any degree no more than to give any degree of life to the dead body thou canst do nothing more or less in this matter thou art utterly without strength to be deeply sensible of this how helpless thou art as well as how guilty and how sinful  this is that repentance not to be repented of which is the forerunner of the kingdom of god  if to this lively conviction of thy inward and outward sins of thy utter guiltiness and helplessness there be added suitable affections sorrow of heart for having despised thy own mercies  remorse and selfcondemnation having thy mouth stopped  shame to lift up thine eyes to heaven  fear of the wrath of god abiding on thee of his curse hanging over thy head and of the fiery indignation ready to devour those who forget god and obey not our lord jesus christ  earnest desire to escape from that indignation to cease from evil and learn to do well  then i say unto thee in the name of the lord thou art not far from the kingdom of god one step more and thou shalt enter in thou dost repent now believe the gospel the gospel that is good tidings good news for guilty helpless sinners in the largest sense of the word means the whole revelation made to men by jesus christ and sometimes the whole account of what our lord did and suffered while he tabernacled among men the substance of all is jesus christ came into the world to save sinners or god so loved the world that he gave his onlybegotten son to the end we might not perish but have everlasting life or he was bruised for our transgressions he was wounded for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed believe this and the kingdom of god is thine by faith thouattainest the promise he pardoneth and absolveth all that truly repent and unfeignedly believe his holy gospel as soon as ever god hath spoken to thy heart be of good cheer thy sins are forgiven thee his kingdom comes thou hast righteousness and peace and joy in the holy ghost only beware thou do not deceive thy own soul with regard to the nature of this faith it is not as some have fondly conceived a bare assent to the truth of the bible of the articles of our creed or of all that is contained in the old and new testament the devils believe this as well as i or thou and yet they are devils still but it is over and above this a sure trust in the mercy of god through christ jesus it is a confidence in a pardoning god it is a divine evidence or conviction that god was in christ reconciling the world to himself not imputing to them their former trespasses and in particular that the son of god hath loved me and given himself for me and that i even i am now reconciled to god by the blood of the cross dost thou thus believe then the peace of god is in thy heart and sorrow and sighing flee away thou art no longer in doubt of the love of god it is clear as the noonday sun thoucriest out my song shall be always of the lovingkindness of the lord with my mouth will i ever be telling of thy truth from one generation to another thou art no longer afraid of hell or death or him that had once the power of death the devil no nor painfully afraid of god himself only thou hast a tender filial fear of offending him dost thou believe then thy soul doth magnify the lord and thy spirit rejoiceth in god thy saviour thourejoicest in that thou hast redemption through his blood even the forgiveness of sins thourejoicest in that spirit of adoption whichcrieth in thy heart abba father thou rejoicest in a hope full of immortality in reaching forth unto the mark of the prize of thy high calling in an earnest expectation of all the good things which god hath prepared for them that love him  dost thou now believe then the love of god is now shed abroad in thy heart thoulovest him because he first loved us and because thoulovest god thou lovest thy brother also and being filled with love peace joy thou art also filled with longsuffering gentleness fidelity goodness meekness temperance and all the other fruits of the same spirit in a word with whatever dispositions are holy are heavenly or divine for while thou beholdest with open uncovered face   the veil now being taken away the glory of the lord his glorious love and the glorious image wherein thou wast created thou art changed into the same image from glory to glory by the spirit of the lord 13 this repentance this faith this peace joy love this change from glory to glory is what the wisdom of the world has voted to be madness mere enthusiasm utter distraction but thou o man of god regard them not be thou moved by none of these things thouknowest in whom thou hast believed see that no man take thy crownwhereunto thou hast already attained hold fast and follow till thou attain all the great and precious promises and thou who hast not yet known him let not vain men make thee ashamed of the gospel of christ be thou in nothing terrified by those who speak evil of the things which they know not god will soon turn thy heaviness into joy o let not thy hands hang down yet a little longer and he will take away thy fears and give thee the spirit of a sound mind he is nigh that justifieth who is he that condemneth it is christ that died yea rather that rose again who is even now at the right hand of god making intercession for thee now cast thyself on the lamb of god with all thy sins how many soever they be and an entrance shall now be ministered unto thee into the kingdom of our lord and saviour jesus christ   sermon 8 text of the 1872 edition the first fruits of the spirit there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit rom 81 by them which are in christ jesus st paul evidently means those who truly believe in him those who being justified by faith have peace with god through our lord jesus christ they who thus believe do no longer walk after the flesh no longer follow the motions of corrupt nature but after the spirit both their thoughts words and works are under the direction of the blessed spirit of god  there is therefore now no condemnation to these there is no condemnation to them from god for he hath justified them freely by his grace through the redemption that is in jesus he hath forgiven all their iniquities and blotted out all their sins and there is no condemnation to them from within for they have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that they might know the things which are freely given to them of god 1 cor 212 which spiritbeareth witness with their spirits that they are the children of god and to this is added the testimony of their conscience that in simplicity and godly sincerity not with fleshly wisdom but by the grace of god they have had their conversation in the world 2 cor 112 but because this scripture has been so frequently misunderstood and that in so dangerous a manner because such multitudes of unlearned and unstable men hoiamatheis kai asteriktoi men untaught of god and consequently unestablished in the truth which is after godliness have wrested it to their own destruction i propose to show as clearly as i can first who those are which are in christ jesus and walk not after the flesh but after the spirit and secondly how there is no condemnation to these i shall conclude with some practical inferences i 1 first i am to show who those are that are in christ jesus and are they not those who believe in his name those who are found in him not having their own righteousness but the righteousness which is of god by faith these who have redemption through his blood are properly said to be in him for they dwell in christ and christ in them they are joined unto the lord in one spirit they are ingrafted into him as branches into the vine they are united as members to their head in a manner which words cannot express nor could it before enter into their hearts to conceive now whosoeverabideth in him sinneth not walketh not after the flesh the flesh in the usual language of st paul signifies corrupt nature in this sense he uses the word writing to thegalatians the works of the flesh are manifest gal 519 and a little before walk in the spirit and ye shall not fulfil the lust or desire of the flesh v 16 to prove which namely that those who walk by the spiritdo not fulfil the lusts of the flesh he immediately adds for the fleshlusteth against the spirit and the spirit lusteth against the flesh for these are contrary to each other that ye may not do the things which ye would so the words are literally translated hina me ha an thelete tauta poiete not so that ye cannot do the things that ye would as if the flesh overcame the spirit a translation which hath not only nothing to do with the original text of the apostle but likewise makes his whole argument nothing worth yea asserts just the reverse of what he is proving they who are of christ who abide in him have crucified the flesh with its affections and lusts they abstain from all those works of the flesh from adultery and fornication fromuncleanness and lasciviousness from idolatry witchcraft hatred variance  from emulations wrath strife sedition heresies envyings murders drunkennessrevellings from every design and word and work to which the corruption of nature leads although they feel the root of bitterness in themselves yet are they endued with power from on high to trample it continually under foot so that it cannot spring up to trouble them insomuch that every fresh assault which they undergo only gives them   fresh occasion of praise of crying out thanks be unto god whogiveth us the victory through jesus christ our lord they now walk after the spirit both in their hearts and lives they are taught of him to love god and their neighbour with a love which is as a well of water springing up into everlasting life and by him they are led into every holy desire into every divine and heavenly temper till every thought which arises in their heart is holiness unto the lord they who walk after the spirit are also led by him into all holiness of conversation their speech is always in grace seasoned with salt with the love and fear of god no corrupt communication comes out of their mouth but only that which is good that which is to the use of edifying which is meet to minister grace to the hearers and herein likewise do they exercise themselves day and night to do only the things which please god in all their outward behaviour to follow him who left us an example that we might tread in his steps in all their intercourse with their neighbour to walk in justice mercy and truth and whatsoever they do in every circumstances of life to do all to the glory of god these are they who indeed walk after the spirit being filled with faith and with the holy ghost they possess in their hearts and show forth in their lives in the whole course of their words and actions the genuine fruits of the spirit of god namely love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness fidelity meekness temperance and whatsoever else is lovely or praiseworthy they adorn in all things the gospel of god our saviour and give full proof to all mankind that they are indeed actuated by the same spirit which raised up jesus from the dead ii 1 i proposed to show in the second place how there is no condemnation to them which are thus in christ jesus and thus walk not after the flesh but after the spirit and first to believers in christ walking thus there is no condemnation on account of their past sins god condemneth them not for any of these they are as though they had never been they are cast as a stone into the depth of the sea and heremembereth them no more god having set forth his son to be a propitiation for them through faith in his blood hath declared unto them his righteousness for the remission of the sins that are past helayeth therefore none of these to their charge their memorial is perished with them and there is no condemnation in their own breast no sense of guilt or dread of the wrath of god they have the witness in themselves they are conscious of their interest in the blood of sprinkling they have not received again the spirit of bondage unto fear unto doubt and racking uncertainty but they have received the spirit of adoption crying in their heart abba father thus being justified by faith they have the peace of god ruling in their hearts flowing from a continual sense of his pardoning mercy and the answer of a good conscience toward god if it be said but sometimes a believer in christ may lose his sight of the mercy of god sometimes such darkness may fall upon him that he no longer sees him that is invisible no longer feels that witness in himself of his part in the atoning blood and then he is inwardly condemned he hath again the sentence of death in himself  i answer supposing it so to be supposing him not to see the mercy of god then he is not a believer for faith implies light the light of god shining upon the soul so far therefore as any one loses this light he for the time loses his faith and no doubt a true believer in christ may lose the light of faith and so far as this is lost he may for a time fall again into condemnation but this is not the case of them who now are in christ jesus who now believe in his name for so long as they believe and walk after the spirit neither god condemns them nor their own heart they are not condemned secondly for any present sins for now transgressing the commandments of god for they do not transgress them they do not walk after the flesh but after the spirit this is the continual proof of their love of god that they keep his commandments even as st john bears witness whosoever is born of god doth not commit sin for his seedremaineth in him and he cannot sin because he is born of god he cannot so long as that seed of god that loving holy faith remaineth in him so long as he keepeth himself herein that wicked onetoucheth him not now it   is evident he is not condemned for the sins which he doth not commit at all they therefore who are thus led by the spirit are not under the law gal 518 not under the curse or condemnation of it for it condemns none but those who break it thus that law of god thou shalt not steal condemns none but those who do steal thus remember the sabbathday to keep it holy condemns those only who do not keep it holy but against the fruits of the spirit there is no law 523 as the apostle more largely declares in those memorable words of his former epistle to timothy we know that the law is good if a man use it lawfully knowing this if while he uses the law of god in order either to convince or direct he know and remember this hoti dikaio nomos ou keitai not that the law is not made for a righteous man but that the law does not lie against a righteous man it has no force against him no power to condemn him but against the lawless and disobedient against the ungodly and sinners against the unholy and profane according to the glorious gospel of the blessed god 1 tim 18 9 11 they are not condemned thirdly for inward sin even though it does now remain that the corruption of nature does still remain even in those who are the children of god by faith that they have in them the seeds of pride and vanity of anger lust and evil desire yea sin of every kind is too plain to be denied being matter of daily experience and on this account it is that st paul speaking to those whom he had just before witnessed to be in christ jesus 1 cor 12 9 to have been called of god into the fellowship or participation of his son jesus christ  yet declares brethren i could not speak unto you as unto spiritual but as unto carnal even as unto babes in christ 1 cor 31 babes in christ so we see they were in christ they were believers in a low degree and yet how much of sin remained in them of that carnal mind which is not subject to the law of god  and yet for all this they are not condemned although they feel the flesh the evil nature in them although they are more sensible day by day that their heart is deceitful and desperately wicked yet so long as they do not yield thereto so long as they give no place to the devil so long as they maintain a continual war with all sin with pride anger desire so that the flesh hath not dominion over them but they still walk after the spirit there is no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus god is well pleased with their sincere though imperfect obedience and they have confidence toward god knowing they are his by the spirit which he hath given them 1 john 324 nay fourthly although they are continually convinced of sin cleaving to all they do although they are conscious of not fulfilling the perfect law either in their thoughts or words or works although they know they do not love the lord their god with all their heart and mind and soul and strength although they feel more or less of pride or selfwill stealing in and mixing with their best duties although even in their more immediate intercourse with god when they assemble themselves with the great congregation and when they pour out their souls in secret to him whoseeth all the thoughts and intents of the heart they are continually ashamed of their wandering thoughts or of the deadness and dulness of their affections yet there is no condemnation to them still either from god or from their own heart the consideration of these manifold defects only gives them a deeper sense that they have always need of that blood of sprinkling which speaks for them in the ears of god and that advocate with the father who ever liveth to make intercession for them so far are these from driving them away from him in whom they have believed that they rather drive them the closer to him whom they feel the want of every moment and at the same time the deeper sense they have of this want the more earnest desire do they feel and the more diligent they are as they have received the lord jesus so to walk in him  they are not condemned fifthly for sins of infirmity as they are usually called perhaps it were advisable rather to call them infirmities that we may not seem to give any countenance to sin or to extenuate it in any degree by thus coupling it with infirmity but if we must retain so ambiguous and dangerous an expression by sins of infirmity i would mean such involuntary failings as the saying a thing we believe true though in fact it prove to be false or the hurting our neighbour without knowing or designing it perhaps when we designed to do him good though these are deviations from the holy and acceptable and perfect will of god yet they are not properly sins nor do they bring any guilt on the conscience of them which are in christ jesus they separate not between god and them neither intercept the light of his countenance as being no ways inconsistent with their general character of walking not after the flesh but after the spirit   lastly there is no condemnation to them for anything whatever which it is not in their power to help whether it be of an inward or outward nature and whether it be doing something or leaving something undone for instance the lords supper is to be administered but you do not partake thereof why do you not you are confined by sickness therefore you cannot help omitting it and for the same reason you are not condemned there is no guilt because there is no choice as there is a willing mind it is accepted according to that a man hath not according to that he hath not a believer indeed may sometimes be grieved because he cannot do what his soul longs for he may cry out when he is detained from worshipping god in the great congregation like as the hart panteth after the waterbrooks so panteth my soul after thee o god my soul is athirst for god yea even for the living god when shall i come to appear in the presence of god he may earnestly desire only still saying in his heart not as i will but as thou wilt to go again with the multitude and bring them forth into the house of god but still if he cannot go he feels no condemnation no guilt no sense of gods displeasure but can cheerfully yield up those desires with o my soul put thy trust in god for i will yet give him thanks who is the help of my countenance and my god it is more difficult to determine concerning those which are usually styled sins of surprise as when one who commonly in patience possesses his soul on a sudden and violent temptation speaks or acts in a manner not consistent with the royal law thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself perhaps it is not easy to fix a general rule concerning transgressions of this nature we cannot say either that men are or that they are not condemned for sins of surprise in general but it seems whenever a believer is by surprise overtaken in a fault there is more or less condemnation as there is more or less concurrence of his will in proportion as a sinful desire or word or action is more or less voluntary so we may conceive god is more or less displeased and there is more or less guilt upon the soul  but if so then there may be some sins of surprise which bring much guilt and condemnation for in some instances our being surprised is owing to some wilful and culpable neglect or to a sleepiness of soul which might have been prevented or shaken off before the temptation came a man may be previously warned either of god or man that trials and dangers are at hand and yet may say in his heart a little more slumber a little more folding of the hands to rest now if such an one afterwards fall though unawares into the snare which he might have avoided that he fell unawares is no excuse he might have foreseen and have shunned the danger the falling even by surprise in such an instance as this is in effect a wilful sin and as such must expose the sinner to condemnation both from god and his own conscience on the other hand there may be sudden assaults either from the world or the god of this world and frequently from our own evil hearts which we did not and hardly could foresee and by these even a believer while weak in faith may possibly be borne down suppose into a degree of anger or thinking evil of another with scarce any concurrence of his will now in such a case the jealous god would undoubtedly show him that he had done foolishly he would be convinced of having swerved from the perfect law from the mind which was in christ and consequently grieved with a godly sorrow and lovingly ashamed before god yet need he not come into condemnation godlayeth not folly to his charge but hath compassion upon him even as a fatherpitieth his own children and his heart condemneth him not in the midst of that sorrow and shame he can still say i will trust and not be afraid for the lord jehovah is my strength and my song he also is become my salvation iii 1 it remains only to draw some practical inferences from the preceding considerations and first if there be no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus and walk not after the flesh  but after the spirit on account of their past sin then why art thou fearful o thou of little faith though thy sins were once more in number than the sand what is that to thee now thou art in christ jesus who shall lay anything to the charge of gods elect it is god thatjustifieth who is he that condemneth all the sins thou hast committed from thy youth up until the hour when thou wast accepted in the beloved are driven away as chaff are gone are lost swallowed up remembered no more thou art now born of the spirit wilt thou be troubled or afraid of what is done before thou   wert born away with thy fears thou art not called to fear but to the spirit of love and of a sound mind know thy calling rejoice in god thy saviour and give thanks to god thy father through him 2 wilt thou say but i have again committed sin since i had redemption through his blood and therefore it is that i abhor myself and repent in dust and ashes it is meet thou shouldest abhor thyself and it is god who hath wrought thee to this selfsame thing but dost thou now believe hath he again enabled thee to say i know that my redeemerliveth and the life which i now live i live by faith in the son of god then that faith again cancels all that is past and there is no condemnation to thee at whatsoever time thou trulybelievest in the name of the son of god all thy sins antecedent to that hour vanish away as the morning dew now then stand thou fast in the liberty wherewith christ hath made thee free he hath once more made thee free from the power of sin as well as from the guilt and punishment of it o be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage neither the vile devilish bondage of sin of evil desires evil tempers or words or works the most grievous yoke on this side hell nor the bondage of slavish tormenting fear of guilt and selfcondemnation  3but secondly do all they which abide in christ jesus walk not after the flesh but after the spirit then we cannot but infer that whosoever nowcommitteth sin hath no part or lot in this matter he is even now condemned by his own heart but if our heart condemn us if our own consciencebeareth witness that we are guilty undoubtedly god doth for he is greater than our heart andknoweth all things  so that we cannot deceive him if we can ourselves and think not to say i was justified once my sins were once forgiven me i know not that neither will i dispute whether they were or no perhaps at this distance of time it is next to impossible to know with any tolerable degree of certainty whether that was a true genuine work of god or whether thou didst only deceive thy own soul but this i know with the utmost degree of certainty he thatcommitteth sin is of the devil therefore thou art of thy father the devil it cannot be denied for the works of thy father thou doest o flatter not thyself with vain hopes say not to thy soul peacepeace for there is no peace cry aloud cry unto god out of the deep if haply he may hear thy voice come unto him as at first as wretched and poor as sinful miserable blind and naked and beware thou suffer thy soul to take no rest till his pardoning love be again revealed till he heal thybackslidings and fill thee again with the faith that worketh by love  4 thirdly is there no condemnation to them which walk after the spirit by reason of inward sin still remaining so long as they do not give way thereto nor by reason of sin cleaving to all they do then fret not thyself because of ungodliness though it still remain in thy heart repine not because thou still comest short of the glorious image of god nor yet because pride selfwill or unbelief cleave to all thy words and works and be not afraid to know all this evil of thy heart to know thyself as also thou art known yea desire of god that thou mayest not think of thyself more highly than thou oughtest to think let thy continual prayer be show me as my soul can bear the depth of inbred sin all the unbelief declare the pride that lurks within but when he heareth thy prayer and unveils thy heart when he shows theethroughly what spirit thou art of then beware that thy faith fail thee not that thou suffer not thy shield to be torn from thee be abased be humbled in the dust see thyself nothing less than nothing and vanity but still let not thy heart be troubled neither let it be afraid still hold fast i even i have an advocate with the father jesus christ the righteous and as the heavens are higher than the earth so is his love higher than even my sins therefore god is merciful to thee a sinner such a sinner as thou art god is love and christ hath died therefore the father himselfloveth thee thou art his child therefore he will withhold from thee no manner of thing that is good is it good that the whole body of sin which is now crucified in thee should be destroyed it shall be done thou shalt be cleansed from all filthiness both of flesh and spirit is it good that nothing should remain in thy heart but the pure   love of god alone be of good cheer thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and mind and soul and strength faithful is he that hath promised who also will do it it is thy part patiently to continue in the work of faith and in the labour of love and in cheerful peace in humble confidence with calm and resigned and yet earnest expectation to wait till the zeal of the lord of hosts shall perform this  fourthly if they that are in christ and walk after the spirit are not condemned for sins of infirmity as neither for involuntary failings nor for anything whatever which they are not able to help then beware o thou that hast faith in his blood that satan herein gain no advantage over thee thou art still foolish and weak blind and ignorant more weak than any words can express more foolish than it call yet enter into thy heart to conceive knowing nothing yet as thououghtest to know yet let not all thy weakness and folly or any fruit thereof which thou art not yet able to avoid shake thy faith thy filial trust in god or disturb thy peace or joy in the lord the rule which some give as to wilful sins and which in that case may perhaps be dangerous is undoubtedly wise and safe if it be applied only to the case of weakness and infirmities art thou fallen o man of god yet do not lie there fretting thyself and bemoaning thy weakness but meekly say lord i shall fall every moment unless thou uphold me with thy hand and then arise leap and walk go on thy way run with patience the race that is set before thee lastly since a believer need not come into condemnation even though he be surprised into what his soul abhors suppose his being surprised is not owing to any carelessness or wilful neglect of his own if thou who believest art thus overtaken in a fault then grieve unto the lord it shall be a precious balm pour out thy heart before him and show him of thy trouble and pray with all thy might to him who is touched with the feeling of thyinfirmitiesthat he would establish and strengthen and settle thy soul and suffer thee to fall no more but still hecondemneth thee not wherefore shouldest thou fear thou hast no need of any fear that hath torment thou shalt love him that loveth thee and it sufficeth more love will bring more strength and as soon as thoulovest him with all thy heart thou shalt be perfect and entire lacking nothing wait in peace for that hour when the god of peace shall sanctify thee wholly so that thy whole spirit and soul and body may be preserved blameless unto the coming of our lord jesus christ   sermon 9 text from the 1872 edition the spirit of bondage and of adoption ye have not received the spirit of bondage again unto fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father romans 815 st paul here speaks to those who are the children of god by faith ye saith he who are indeed his children have drank into his spirit ye have not received the spirit of bondage again unto fear but because ye are sons god hath sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father the spirit of bondage and fear is widely distant from this loving spirit of adoption those who are influenced only by slavish fear cannot be termed the sons of god yet some of them may be styled his servants and are not far from the kingdom of heaven but it is to be feared the bulk of mankind yea of what is called the christian world have not attained even this but are still afar off neither is god in all their thoughts a few names may be found of those who love god a few more there are that fear him but the greater part have neither the fear of god before their eyes nor the love of god in their hearts perhaps most of you who by the mercy of god now partake of a better spirit may remember the time when ye were as they when ye were under the same condemnation but at first ye knew it not though ye were wallowing daily in your sins and in your blood till in due time ye received the spirit of fear ye received for this also is the gift of god and afterwards fear vanished away and the spirit of love filled your hearts one who is in the first state of mind without fear of love is in scripture termed a natural man one who is under the spirit of bondage and fear is sometimes said to be under the law although that expression more frequently signifies one who is under the jewish dispensation or who thinks himself obliged to observe all the rites and ceremonies of the jewish law but one who has exchanged the spirit of fear for the spirit of love is properly said to be under grace now because it highly imports us to know what spirit we are of i shall endeavour to point out distinctly first the state of a natural man secondly that of one who is under the law and thirdly of one who is under grace i 1 and first the state of a natural man this the scripture represents as a state of sleep the voice of god to him is awake thou thatsleepest for his soul is in a deep sleep his spiritual senses are not awake they discern neither spiritual good nor evil the eyes of his understanding are closed they are sealed together and see not clouds and darkness continually rest upon them for he lies in the valley of the shadow of death hence having no inlets for the knowledge of spiritual things all the avenues of his soul being shut up he is in gross stupid ignorance of whatever he is most concerned to know he is utterly ignorant of god knowing nothing concerning him as he ought to know he is totally a stranger to the law of god as to its true inward spiritual meaning he has no conception of that evangelical holiness without which no man shall see the lord nor of the happiness which they only find whose life is hid with christ in god 2 and for this very reason because he is fast asleep he is in some sense at rest because he is blind he is also secure he saith tush there shall no harm happen unto me the darkness which covers him on every side keeps him in a kind of peace so far as peace can consist with the works of the devil and with an earthly devilish mind he sees not that he stands on the edge of the pit therefore he fears it not he cannot tremble at the danger he does not know he has not understanding enough to fear why is it that he is in no dread of god because he is totally ignorant of him if not saying in his heart there is no god or that he sitteth on the circle of the heavens and humbleth not   himself to behold the things which are done on earth yet satisfying himself as well to all epicurean intents and purposes by saying god is merciful confounding and swallowing up all at once in that unwieldy idea of mercy all his holiness and essential hatred of sin all his justice wisdom and truth he is in no dread of the vengeance denounced against those who obey not the blessed law of god because he understands it not he imagines the main point is to do thus to be outwardly blameless and sees not that it extends to every temper desire thought motion of the heart or he fancies that the obligation hereto is ceased that christ came to destroy the law and the prophets to save his people in not from their sins to bring them to heaven without holiness  notwithstanding his own words not one jot or tittle of the law shall pass away till all things are fulfilled and not every one that saith unto me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven  he is secure because he is utterly ignorant of himself hence he talks of repenting by and by he does not indeed exactly know when but some time or other before he dies taking it for granted that this is quite in his own power for what should hinder his doing it if he will if he does but once set a resolution no fear but he will make it good but this ignorance never so strongly glares as in those who are termed men of learning if a natural man be one of these he can talk at large of his rational faculties of the freedom of his will and the absolute necessity of such freedom in order to constitute man a moral agent he reads and argues and proves to a demonstration that every man may do as he will may dispose his own heart to evil or good as it seems best in his own eyes thus the god of this world spreads a double veil of blindness over his heart lest by any means the light of the glorious gospel of christ should shine upon it  from the same ignorance of himself and god there may sometimes arise in the natural man a kind of joy in congratulating himself upon his own wisdom and goodness and what the world calls joy he may often possess he may have pleasure in various kinds either in gratifying the desires of the flesh or the desire of the eye or the pride of life particularly if he has large possessions if he enjoy an affluent fortune then he may clothe himself in purple and fine linen and fare sumptuously every day and so long as he thus doeth well unto himself men will doubtless speak good of him they will say he is a happy man for indeed this is the sum of worldly happiness to dress and visit and talk and eat and drink and rise up to play it in not surprising if one in such circumstances as these dosed with the opiates of flattery and sin should imagine among his other waking dreams that he walks in great liberty how easily may he persuade himself that he is at liberty from all vulgar errors and from the prejudice of education judging exactly right and keeping clear of all extremes i am free may he say from all the enthusiasm of weak and narrow souls from superstition the disease of fools and cowards always righteous over much and from bigotry continually incident to those who have not a free and generous way of thinking and too sure it is that he is altogether free from the wisdom which cometh from above from holiness from the religion of the heart from the whole mind which was in christ  for all this time he is the servant of sin he commits sin more or less day by day yet he is not troubled he is in no bondage as some speak he feels no condemnation he contents himself even though he should profess to believe that the christian revelation is of god with man is frail we are all weak every man has his infirmity perhaps he quotes scripture why does not solomon say  the righteous man falls into sin seven times a day  and doubtless they are all hypocrites or enthusiasts who pretend to be better than their neighbours if at any time a serious thought fix upon him he stifles it as soon as possible with why should i fear since god is merciful and christ died for sinners thus he remains a willing servant of sin content with the bondage of corruption inwardly and outwardly unholy and satisfied therewith not only not conquering sin but not striving to conquer particularly that sin which doth so easily beset him such is the state of every natural man whether he be a gross scandalous transgressor or a more reputable and decent sinner having the form though not the power of godliness but how can such an   one be convinced of sin how is he brought to repent to be under the law to receive the spirit of bondage unto fear this is the point which in next to be considered ii 1 by some awful providence or by his word applied with the demonstration of his spirit god touches the heart of him that lay asleep in darkness and in the shadow of death he is terribly shaken out of his sleep and awakes into a consciousness of his danger perhaps in a moment perhaps by degrees the eyes of his understanding are opened and now first the veil being in part removed discern the real state he is in horrid light breaks in upon his soul such light as may be conceived to gleam from the bottomless pit from the lowest deep from a lake of fire burning with brimstone he at last sees the loving the merciful god is also a consuming fire that he is a just god and a terrible rendering to every man according to his words entering into judgment with the ungodly for every idle word yea and for the imaginations of the heart he now clearly perceives that the great and holy god is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity that he is an avenger of every one whorebelleth against him and repayeth the wicked to his face and that it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living god the inward spiritual meaning of the law of god now begins to glare upon him he perceives the commandment is exceeding broad and there is nothing hid from the light thereof he is convinced that every part of it relates not barely to outward sin or obedience but to what passes in the secret recesses of the soul which no eye but gods can penetrate if he now hears thou shalt not kill god speaks in thunder he that hateth his brother is a murderer he that saith unto his brother thou fool is obnoxious to hellfire if the law say thou shalt not commit adultery the voice of the lord sounds in his ears he that looketh on a woman to lust after he hath committed adultery with her already in his heart and thus in every point he feels the word of god quick and powerful sharper than a twoedged sword it pierces even to the dividing asunder of his soul and spirit his joints and marrow and so much the more because he is conscious to himself of having neglected so great salvation of having trodden under foot the son of god who would have saved him from his sins and counted the blood of the covenant an unholy a commonunsanctifying thing and as he knows all things are naked and open unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do so he sees himself naked stripped of all the figleaves which he had sewed together of all his poor pretenses to religion or virtue and his wretched excuses for sinning against god he now sets himself like the ancient sacrifices cleft in sunder as it were from the neck downward so that all within him stands confessed his heart is bare and he sees it is all sin deceitful above all things desperately wicked that it is altogether corrupt and abominable more than it is possible for tongue to express that there dwelleth therein no good thing but unrighteousness and ungodliness only every motion thereof every temper and thought being only evil continually and he not only sees but feels in himself by an emotion of soul which he cannot describe that for the sins of his heart were his life without blame which yet it is not and cannot be seeing an evil tree cannot bring forth good fruit he deserves to be cast into the fire that never shall be quenched he feels that the wages the just reward of sin of his sin above all is death even the second death the death which dieth not the destruction of body and soul in hell here ends his pleasing dream his delusive rest his false peace his vain security his joy now vanishes as a cloud pleasures once loved delight no more they pall upon the taste he loathes the nauseous sweet he is weary to bear them the shadows of happiness flee away and sink into oblivion so that he is stripped of all and wanders to and fro seeking rest but finding none the fumes of those opiates being now dispelled he feels the anguish of a wounded spirit he finds that sin let loose upon the soul whether it be pride anger or evil desire whether selfwill malice envy revenge or any other is perfect misery he feels sorrow of heart for the blessings he has lost and the curse which is come upon him remorse for having thus destroyed himself and despised his own mercies fear from a lively sense of the wrath of god and of the consequences of his wrath of the punishment which he has justly deserved and which he sees hanging over is head  fear of death as being to him the gate of hell the entrance of death eternal  fear of the devil the executioner of the wrath and righteous vengeance of god  fear of men who if they were able to kill his body would thereby plunge both body and soul into hell fear sometimes arising to such a height   that the poor sinful guilty soul is terrified with everything with nothing with shades with a leaf shaken of the wind yea sometimes it may even border upon distraction making a man drunken though not with wine suspending the exercise of the memory of the understanding of all the natural faculties sometimes it may approach to the very brink of despair so that he who trembles at the name of death may yet be ready to plunge into it every moment to choose strangling rather than life well may such a man roar like him of old for the verydisquietness of his heart well may he cry out the spirit of a man may sustain his infirmities but a wounded spirit who can bear now he truly desires to break loose from sin and begins to struggle with it but though he strive with all his might he cannot conquer sin is mightier than he he would fain escape but he is so fast in prison that he cannot get forth he resolved against sin but yet sins on he sees the snare and abhors and runs into it so much does his boasted reason avail  only to enhance his guilt and increase his misery such is the freedom of his will free only to evil free to drink in iniquity like water to wander farther and farther from the living god and do more despite to the spirit of grace  the more he strive wishes labours to be free the more does he feel his chains the grievous chains of sin wherewith satan binds and leads him captive at his will his servant he is though he repine ever so much though he rebel he cannot prevail he is still in bondage and fear by reason of sin generally of some outward sin to which he is peculiarly disposed either by nature custom or outward circumstance but always of some inward sin some evil temper or unholy affection and the more he frets against it the more it prevails he may bite but cannot break his chain thus he toils without end repenting and sinning and repenting and sinning again till at length the poor sinful helpless wretch is even at his wits end and can barely groan o wretched man that i am who shall deliver me from the body of this death this whole struggle of one who is under the law under the spirit of fear and bondage is beautifully described by the apostle in the foregoing chapter speaking in the person of anawakened man i saith he was alive without the law once verse 9 i had much life wisdom strength and virtue so i thought but when the commandment came sin revived and i died when the commandment in its spiritual meaning came to my heart with the power of god my inbred sin was stirred up fretted inflamed and all my virtue died away and the commandment which was ordained to life i found to be unto death for sin taking occasion by the commandment deceived me and by it slew me verses 1011 it came upon me unaware slew all my hopes and plainly showed in the midst of life i was in death wherefore the law is holy and the commandment holy and just and good verse 12 i no longer lay the blame on this but on the corruption of my own heart i acknowledge that the law is spiritual but i am carnal sold under sin verse 14 i now see both the spiritual nature of the law and my own carnal devilish heart sold under sin totally enslaved like slave bought with money who were absolutely at their masters disposal for that which i do i allow not for what i would i do not but what i hate that i do verse 15 such is the bondage under which i groan such the tyranny of my hard master to will is present with me but how to perform that which is good i find not for the good that i would i do not but the evil which i would not that i do verses 18 19 i find a law an inward constraining power that when i would do good evil is present with me for i delight in or consent to the law of god after the inward man verses 21 22 in my mind so the apostle explains himself in the words that immediately follow and so o eso anthropos the inward man is understood in all other greek writers but i see another law in my members another constraining power warring against the law of my mind or inward man and bringing me into captivity to the law or power of sin verse 23 dragging me as it were at my conquerors chariotwheels into the very thing which my soul abhors o wretched man that i am who shall deliver me from the body of this death verse 24 who shall deliver me from this helpless dying life from this bondage of sin and misery till this is done i myself or rather that i autos ego that man i am now personating with the mind or inward man serve the law of god my mind my conscience is on gods side but with my flesh with my body the law of sin verse 25 being hurried away by a force i cannot resist  how lively a portraiture is this of one under the law one who feels the burden he cannot shake off who pants after liberty power and love but is in fear and bondage still until the time that god   answers the wretched man crying out who shall deliver me from this bondage of sin from this body of death  the grace of god through jesus christ thy lord iii 1 them it is that this miserable bondage ends and he is no more under the law but under grace this state we are thirdly to consider the state of one who has found grace or favour in the sight of god even the father and who has the grace or power of the holy ghost reigning in his heart who has received in the language of the apostle the spirit of adoption whereby he now cries abba father he cried unto the lord in his trouble and god delivers him out of his distress his eyes are opened in quite another manner than before even to see a loving gracious god while he is calling i beseech thee show me thy glory  he hears a voice in the inmost soul i will make all my goodness pass before thee and i will proclaim the name of the lord i will be gracious to whom i will be gracious and i will show mercy to whom i will show mercy and it is not long before the lord descends in the cloud and proclaims the name of the lord then he sees but not with eyes of flesh and blood the lord the lord god merciful and gracious longsuffering and abundant in goodness and truth keeping mercy for thousands and forgiving iniquities and transgressions and sin heavenly healing light now breaks in upon his soul he looks on him whom he had pierced and god who out of darkness commanded light to shineshineth in his heart he sees the light of the glorious love of god in the face of jesus christ he hath a divine evidence of things not seen by sense even of the deep things of god more particularly of the love of god of his pardoning love to him that believes in jesus overpowered with the sight his whole soul cried out my lord and my god for he sees all his iniquities laid on him who bare them in his own body on the tree he beholds the lamb of god taking away his sins how clearly now does he discern that god was in christ reconciling the world unto himself making him sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of god through him  and that he himself is reconciled to god by that blood of the covenant  here end both the guilt and power of sin he can now say i am crucified with christ nevertheless i live yet not i but christ liveth in me and the life which i now live in the flesh even in this mortal body i live by faith in the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me here end remorse and sorrow of heart and the anguish of a wounded spirit godturneth his heaviness into joy he made sore and now his hands bind up here ends also that bondage unto fear for his heart standeth fast believing in the lord he cannot fear any longer the wrath of god for he knows it is now turned away from him and looks upon him no more as an angry judge but as a loving father he cannot fear the devil knowing he has no power except it be given him from above he fears not hell being an heir of the kingdom of heaven consequently he has no fear of death by reason whereof he was in time past for so many years subject to bondage rather knowing that if the earthly house of this tabernacle be dissolved he hath a building of god a house not made with hands eternal in the heavens he groaneth earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with that house which is from heaven he groans to shake off this house of earth that mortality may be swallowed up of life knowing that god hath wrought him for the selfsame thing who hath also given him the earnest of his spirit  and where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty liberty not only from guilt and fear but from sin from that heaviest of all yokes that basest of all bondage his labour is not now in vain the snare is broken and he is delivered he not only strives but likewise prevails he not only fights but conquers also henceforth he does not serve sin chap 66 c he is dead unto sin and alive unto god sin doth not now reign even in his mortal body nor doth he obey it in the desires thereof he does not yield his members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin but as instruments of righteousness unto god for being now made free from sin he is become the servant of righteousness  thus having peace with god through our lord jesus christ rejoicing in hope of the glory of god and having power over all sin over every evil desire and temper and word and work he is a living witness of the glorious liberty of the sons of god all of whom being partakers of like   precious faith bear record with one voice we have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father it is this spirit which continually worketh in them both to will and to do of his good pleasure it is he that sheds the love of god abroad in their hears and the love of all mankind thereby purifying their hearts from the love of world from the lust of the flesh the lust of the eye and the pride of life it is by him they are delivered from anger and pride from all vile and inordinate affections in consequence they are delivered from evil words and works from all unholiness of conversation doing no evil to any child of man and being zealous of all good works to sum up all the natural man neither fears nor loves god one under the law fears  one under grace loves him the first has no light in the things of god but walks in utter darkness the second sees the painful light of hell the third the joyous light of heaven he that sleeps in death has a false peace he that is awakened has no peace at all he that believes has true peace  the peace of god filling and ruling his heart the heathen baptized or unbaptized hath a fancied liberty which is indeed licentiousness the jew or one under the jewish dispensation is in heavy grievous bondage the christian enjoys the true glorious liberty of the sons of god an unawakened child of the devil sins willingly one that is awakened sins unwillingly a child of god sinneth not but keepeth himself and the wicked one toucheth him not to conclude the natural man neither conquers nor fights the man under the law fights with sin but cannot conquer the man under grace fights and conquers yea is more than conqueror through him thatloveth him iv 1 from this plain account of the threefold state of man the natural the legal and the evangelical it appears that it is not sufficient to divide mankind into sincere and insincere a man may be sincere in any of these states not only when he has the spirit of adoption but while he has the spirit of bondage unto fear yea while he has neither this fear nor love for undoubtedly there may be sincere heathens as well as sincere jews or christians this circumstance them does by no means prove that a man is in a state of acceptance with god examine yourselves therefore not only whether ye are sincere but whether ye be in the faith examine narrowly for it imports you much what is the ruling principle in your soul is it the love of god is it the fear of god or is it neither one nor the other is it not rather the love of the world the love of pleasure or gain of ease or reputation if so you are not come so far as a jew you are but a heathen still have you heaven in your heart have you the spirit of adoption ever crying abba father or do you cry unto god as out of the belly of hell overwhelmed with sorrow and fear or are you a stranger to this whole affair and cannot imagine what i mean heathen pull off the mask thou hast never put on christ stand barefaced look up to heaven and own before him that liveth for ever and ever thou hast no part either among the sons of servants of god whosoever thou art dost thou commit sin or dost thou not if thou dost is it willingly or unwillingly in either case god hath told thee whose thou art he thatcommitteth sin is of the devil if thou committest it willingly thou art his faithful servant he will not fail to reward thy labour if unwillingly still thou art his servant god deliver thee out of his hands art thou daily fighting against all sin and daily more than conqueror i acknowledge thee for a child of god o stand fast in thy glorious liberty art thou fighting but not conquering striving for the mastery but not able to attain then thou art not yet a believer in christ but follow on and thou shalt know the lord art thou not fighting at all but leading an easy indolent fashionable life o how hast thou dared to name the name of christ only to make it a reproach among the heathen awake thou sleeper call upon thy god before the deep swallow thee up 2 perhaps one reason why so many think of themselves more highly than they ought to think why they do not discern what state they are in is because these several states of soul are often mingled together and in some measure meet in one and the same person thus experience shows that the legal state or state of fear is frequently mixed with the natural for few men are so fast asleep in sin but they are sometimes more or lessawakened as the spirit of god does not wait for the call of man so at some times he will be heard he puts them in fear so that for a season at least the heathen know themselves to be but men they feel the burden of sin and earnestly desire to flee   from the wrath to come but not long they seldom suffer the arrows of conviction to go deep into their souls but quickly stifle the grace of god and return to their wallowing in the mire in like manner the evangelical state or state of love is frequently mixed with the legal for few of those who have the spirit of bondage and fear remain always without hope the wise and gracious god rarely suffers this for he remembereth that we are but dust and hewilleth not that the flesh should fail before him or the spirit which he hath made therefore at such times as heseeth good he gives a dawning of light unto them that sit in darkness he cause a part of his goodness to pass before them and shows he is a god thatheareth the prayer they see the promise which is by faith in christ jesus though it be yet afar off and hereby they are encouraged to run with patience the race which is set before them 3 another reason why many deceive themselves is because they do not consider how far a man may go and yet be in a natural or at best a legal state a man may be of a compassionate and a benevolent temper he may be affable courteous generous friendly he may have some degree of meekness patience temperance and of many other moral virtues he may feel many desires of shaking off all vice and of attaining higher degrees of virtue he may abstain from much evil perhaps from all that is grossly contrary to justice mercy or truth he may do much good may feed the hungry clothe the naked relieve the widow and fatherless he may attend public worship use prayer in private read many books of devotion and yet for all this he may be a mere natural man knowing neither himself nor god equally a stranger to the spirit of fear and to that of love having neither repented nor believed the gospel but suppose there were added to all this a deep conviction of sin with much fear of the wrath of god vehement desires to cast off every sin and tofulfill all righteousness frequent rejoicing in hope and touches of love often glancing upon the soul yet neither do these prove a man to be under grace to have true living christian faith unless the spirit of adoption abide in his heart unless he can continually cry abba father 4 beware then thou who art called by the name of christ that thou come not short of the mark of thy high calling beware thou rest not either in a natural state with too many that are accounted good christians or in a legal state wherein those who are highly esteemed of men are generally content to live and die nay but god hath prepared better things for thee if thou follow on till thou attain thou art not called to fear and tremble like devils but to rejoice and love like the angels of god thou shalt love the lord thy god will all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind and with all thy strength thou shalt rejoice evermore thou shalt pray without ceasing thou shalt in everything give thanks thou shalt do the will of god on earth as it is done in heaven o prove thou what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god now present thyself a living sacrifice holy acceptable to god whereunto thou hast already attained hold fast by reaching forth unto those things which are before until the god of peace make thee perfect in every good work working in thee that which is wellpleasing in his sight through jesus christ to whom be glory for ever and ever amen   sermon 10 text from the 1872 edition the witness of the spirit discourse 1 the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of godrom 816 how many vain men not understanding what they spake neither whereof they affirmed have wrested this scripture to the great loss if not the destruction of their souls how many have mistaken the voice of their own imagination for this witness of the spirit of god and thence idly presumed they were the children of god while they were doing the works of the devil these are truly and properly enthusiasts and indeed in the worst sense of the word but with what difficulty are they convinced thereof especially if they have drank deep into that spirit of error all endeavours to bring them to the knowledge of themselves they will then account fighting against god and that vehemence and impetuosity of spirit which they call contending earnestly for the faith sets them so far above all the usual methods of conviction that we may well say with men it is impossible who can then be surprised if many reasonable men seeing the dreadful effects of this delusion and labouring to keep at the utmost distance from it should sometimes lean toward another extreme  if they are not forward to believe any who speak of having this witness concerning which others have so grievously erred  if they are almost ready to set all down for enthusiasts who use the expressions which have been so terribly abused  yea if they should question whether the witness or testimony here spoken of be the privilege of ordinary christians and not rather one of those extraordinary gifts which they suppose belonged only to the apostolic age 3  but is there any necessity laid upon us of running either into one extreme or the other may we not steer a middle course  keep a sufficient distance from that spirit of error and enthusiasm without denying the gift of god and giving up the great privilege of his children surely we may in order thereto let us consider in the presence and fear of god first what is this witness or testimony of our spirit what is the testimony of gods spirit and how does he bear witness with our spirit that we are the children of god secondly how is this joint testimony of gods spirit and our own clearly and solidly distinguished from the presumption of a natural mind and from the delusion of the devil i 1 let us first consider what is the witness or testimony of our spirit but here i cannot but desire all those who are for swallowing up the testimony of the spirit of god in the rational testimony of our own spirit to observe that in this text the apostle is so far from speaking of the testimony of our own spirit only that it may be questioned whether he speaks of it at all  whether he does not speak only of the testimony of gods spirit it does not appear but the original text may fairly be understood thus the apostle had just said in the preceding verse ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father and immediately subjoins auto to pneuma some copies read to auto pneuma symmartyrei toi pneumati hemon hoti esmen tekna theou which may be translated the same spirit beareth witness to our spirit that we are the children of god the preposition syn only denoting that he witnesses this at the same time that he enables us to cry abba father but i contend not seeing so many other texts with the experience of all real christians sufficiently evince that there is in every believer both the testimony of gods spirit and the testimony of his own that he is a child of god  2 with regard to the latter the foundation thereof is laid in those numerous texts of scripture which describe the marks of the children of god and that so plain that he whichrunneth may read them these are also collected together and placed in the strongest light by many both ancient and modern writers if any need farther light he may receive it by attending on the ministry of gods word by   meditating thereon before god in secret and by conversing with those who have the knowledge of his ways and by the reason or understanding that god has given him which religion was designed not to extinguish but to perfect  according to that of the apostle brethren be not children in understanding in malice or wickedness be ye children but in understanding be ye men 1 cor 1420  every man applying those scriptural marks to himself may know whether he is a child of god thus if he know first as many as are led by the spirit of god into all holy tempers and actions they are the sons of god for which he has the infallible assurance of holy writ secondly i am thus led by the spirit of god he will easily conclude  therefore i am a son of god agreeable to this are all those plain declarations of st john in his first epistle hereby we know that we do know him if we keep his commandments 1 john 23 whosokeepeth his word in him verily is the love of god perfected hereby know we that we are in him that we are indeed the children of god 1 john 25 if ye know that he is righteous ye know that everyone that doeth righteousness is born of him 1 john 229 we know that we have passed from death unto life because we love the brethren 1 john 314 hereby we know that we are of the truth and shall assure our hearts before him namely because we love one another not in word neither in tongue but in deed and in truth hereby know we that we dwell in him because he hath given us of his loving spirit 1 john 413 and hereby we know that heabideth in us by the obedient spirit which he hath given us 1 john 324 it is highly probable there never were any children of god from the beginning of the world unto this day who were farther advanced in the grace of god and the knowledge of our lord jesus christ than the apostle john at the time when he wrote these words and the fathers in christ to whom he wrote notwithstanding which it is evident both the apostle himself and all those pillars in gods temple were very far from despising these marks of their being the children of god and that they applied them to their own souls for the confirmation of their faith yet all this is no other than rational evidence the witness of our spirit our reason or understanding it all resolves into this those who have these marks are the children of god but we have these marks therefore we are children of god  but how does it appear that we have these marks this is a question which still remains how does it appear that we do love god and our neighbour and that we keep his commandments observe that the meaning of the question is how does it appear to ourselves not to others i would ask him then that proposes this question how does it appear to you that you are alive and that you are now in ease and not in pain are you not immediately conscious of it by the same immediate consciousness you will know if your soul is alive to god if you are saved from the pain of proud wrath and have the ease of a meek and quiet spirit by the same means you cannot but perceive if you love rejoice and delight in god by the same you must be directly assured if you love your neighbour as yourself if you are kindly affectioned to all mankind and full of gentleness andlongsuffering and with regard to the outward mark of the children of god which is according to st john the keeping his commandments you undoubtedly know in your own breast if by the grace of god it belongs to you your conscience informs you from day to day if you do not take the name of god within your lips unless with seriousness and devotion with reverence and godly fear if you remember the sabbathday to keep it holy if you honour your father and mother if you do to all as you would they should do unto you if you possess your body in sanctification and honour and if whether you eat or drink you are temperate therein and do all to the glory of god now this is properly the testimony of our own spirit even the testimony of our conscience that god hath given us to be holy of heart and holy in outward conversation it is a consciousness of our having received in and by the spirit of adoption the tempers mentioned in the word of god as belonging to his adopted children even a loving heart toward god and toward all mankind hanging with childlike confidence on god our father desiring nothing but him casting all our care upon him and embracing every child of man with earnest tender affection  a consciousness that we are inwardly conformed by the spirit of god to the image of his son and that we walk before him in justice mercy and truth doing the things which are pleasing in his sight but what is that testimony of gods spirit which issuperadded to and conjoined with this how does he bear witness with our spirit that we are the children of god it is hard to find words in the   language of men to explain the deep things of god indeed there are none that will adequately express what the children of god experience but perhaps one might say desiring any who are taught of god to correct to soften or strengthen the expression the testimony of the spirit is an inward impression on the soul whereby the spirit of god directly witnesses to my spirit that i am a child of god that jesus christ hath loved me and given himself for me and that all my sins are blotted out and i even i am reconciled to god that this testimony of the spirit of god must needs in the very nature of things be antecedent to the testimony of our own spirit may appear from this single consideration we must be holy of heart and holy in life before we can be conscious that we are so before we can have the testimony of our spirit that we are inwardly and outwardly holy but we must love god before we can be holy at all this being the root of all holiness now we cannot love god till we know he loves us we love him because he first loved us and we cannot know his pardoning love to us till his spirit witnesses it to our spirit since therefore this testimony of his spirit must precede the love of god and all holiness of consequence it must precede our inward consciousness thereof or the testimony of our spirit concerning them then and not till then  when the spirit of god beareth that witness to our spirit god hath loved thee and given his own son to be the propitiation for thy sins the son of god hath loved thee and hath washed thee from thy sins in his blood  we love god because he first loved us and for his sake we love our brother also and of this we cannot but be conscious to ourselves we know the things that are freely given to us of god we know that we love god and keep his commandments and hereby also we know that we are of god this is that testimony of our own spirit which so long as we continue to love god and keep his commandments continues joined with the testimony of gods spirit that we are the children of god not that i would by any means be understood by anything which has been spoken concerning it to exclude the operation of the spirit of god even from the testimony of our own spirit in no wise it is he that not only worketh in us every manner of thing that is good but also shines upon his own work and clearly shows what he has wrought accordingly this is spoken of by st paul as one great end of our receiving the spirit that we may know the things which are freely given to us of god that he may strengthen the testimony of our conscience touching our simplicity and godly sincerity and give us to discern in a fuller and stronger light that we now do the things which please him should it still be inquired how does the spirit of god bear witness with our spirit that we are the children of god so as to exclude all doubt and evince the reality of our sonship  the answer is clear from what has been observed above and first as to the witness of our spirit the soul as intimately and evidently perceives when it loves delights and rejoices in god as when it loves and delights in anything on earth and it can no more doubt whether it loves delights and rejoices or no than whether it exists or no if therefore this be just reasoning he that now loves god that delights and rejoices in him with an humble joy and holy delight and an obedient love is a child of god but i thus love delight and rejoice in god therefore i am a child of god  then a christian can in no wise doubt of his being a child of god of the former proposition he has as full an assurance as he has that the scriptures are of god and of his thus loving god he has an inward proof which is nothing short of selfevidence thus the testimony of our own spirit is with the most intimate conviction manifested to our hearts in such a manner as beyond all reasonable doubt to evince the reality of our sonship 12 the manner how the divine testimony is manifested to the heart i do not take upon me to explain such knowledge is too wonderful and excellent for me i cannot attain unto it the windbloweth and i hear the sound thereof but i cannot tell how itcometh or whither it goeth as no one knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of a man that is in him so the manner of the things of godknoweth no one save the spirit of god but the fact we know namely that the spirit of god does give a believer such a testimony of his adoption that while it is present to the soul he can no more doubt the   reality of his sonship than he can doubt of the shining of the sun while he stands full blaze of his beams ii 1 how this joint testimony of gods spirit and our spirit may be clearly and solidly distinguished from the presumption of a natural mind and from the delusion of the devil is the next thing to be considered and it highly imports all who desire the salvation of god to consider it with the deepest attention as they would not deceive their own souls an error in this is generally observed to have the most fatal consequences the rather because he that errs seldom discovers his mistake till it is too late to remedy it and first how is this testimony to be distinguished from the presumption of a natural mind it is certain one who was never convinced of sin is always ready to flatter himself and to think of himself especially in spiritual things more highly than he ought to think and hence it is in no wise strange if one who is vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind when he hears of this privilege of true christians among whom he undoubtedly ranks himself should soon work himself up into a persuasion that he is already possessed thereof such instances now abound in the world and have abounded in all ages how then may the real testimony of the spirit with our spirit be distinguished from this damning presumption i answer the holy scriptures abound with marks whereby the one may be distinguished from the other they describe in the plainest manner the circumstances which go before which accompany and which follow the true genuine testimony of the spirit of god with the spirit of a believer whoever carefully weighs and attends to these will not need to put darkness for light he will perceive so wide a difference with respect to all these between the real and the pretended witness of the spirit that there will be no danger i might say no possibility of confounding the one with the other by these one who vainly presumes on the gift of god might surely know if he really desired it that he hath been hitherto given up to a strong delusion and suffered to believe a lie for the scriptures lay down those clear obvious marks as preceding accompanying and following that gift which a little reflection would convince him beyond all doubt were never found in his soul for instance the scripture describes repentance or conviction of sin as constantly going before this witness of pardon so repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand matt 32 repent ye and believe the gospel mark 115 repent and be baptized every one of you for the remission of sins acts 238 repent ye therefore and be converted that your sins may be blotted out acts 319 in conformity whereto our church also continually places repentance before pardon or the witness of it he pardoneth and absolveth all them that truly repent and unfeignedly believe his holy gospel almighty god  hath promised forgiveness of sins to all them who with hearty repentance and true faith turn unto him but he is a stranger even to this repentance he hath never known a broken and a contrite heart the remembrance of his sins was never grievous unto him nor the burden of them intolerable in repeating those words he never meant what he said he merely paid a compliment to god and were it only from the want of this previous work of god he hath too great reason to believe that he hath grasped a mere shadow and never yet known the real privilege of the sons of god  again the scriptures describe the being born of god which must precede the witness that we are his children as a vast and mighty change a change from darkness to light as well as from the power of satan unto god as a passing from death unto life a resurrection from the dead thus the apostle to the ephesians you hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins eph 21 and again when we were dead in sins he hath quickened us together with christ and hath raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus eph 25 6 but what knoweth he concerning whom we now speak of any such change as this he is altogether unacquainted with this whole matter this is a language which he does not understand he tells you he always was a christian he knows no time when he had need of such a change by this also if he give himself leave to think may he know that he is not born of the spirit that he has never yet known god but has mistaken the voice of nature for the voice of god but waving the consideration of whatever he has or has not experienced in time past by the present marks may we easily distinguish a child of god from a presumptuous selfdeceiver the scriptures   describe that joy in the lord which accompanies the witness of his spirit as a humble joy a joy that abases to the dust that makes a pardoned sinner cry out i am vile what am i or my fathers house now mine eye seeth thee i abhor myself in dust and ashes and wherever lowliness is there is meekness patience gentleness longsuffering there is a soft yielding spirit a mildness and sweetness a tenderness of soul which words cannot express but do these fruits attend that supposed testimony of the spirit in a presumptuous man just the reverse the more confident he is of the favour of god the more is he lifted up the more does he exalt himself the more haughty and assuming is his whole behaviour the stronger witness he imagines himself to have the more overbearing is he to all around him the more incapable of receiving any reproof the more impatient of contradiction instead of being more meek and gentle and teachable more swift to hear and slow to speak he is more slow to hear and swift to speak more unready to learn of anyone more fiery and vehement in his temper and eager in his conversation yea perhaps there will sometimes appear a kind of fierceness in his air his manner of speaking his whole deportment as if he were just going to take the matter out of gods hands and himself to devour the adversaries once more the scriptures teach this is the love of god the sure mark thereof that we keep his commandments 1 john 53 and our lord himself saith he thatkeepeth my commandments he it is that loveth me john 1421 love rejoices to obey to do in every point whatever is acceptable to the beloved a true lover of god hastens to do his will on earth as it is done in heaven but is this the character of the presumptuous pretender to the love of god nay but his love gives him a liberty to disobey to break not keep the commandments of god perhaps when he was in fear of the wrath of god he did labour to do his will but now looking on himself as not under the law he thinks he is no longer obliged to observe it he is therefore less zealous of good works less careful to abstain from evil less watchful over his own heart less jealous over his tongue he is less earnest to deny himself and to take up his cross daily in a word the whole form of his life is changed since he has fancied himself to be at liberty he is no longer exercising himself unto godliness wrestling not only with flesh and blood but with principalities and powers enduring hardships agonizing to enter in at the strait gate no he has found an easier way to heaven a broad smooth flowery path in which he can say to his soul soul take thy ease eat drink and be merry it follows with undeniable evidence that he has not the true testimony of his own spirit he cannot be conscious of having those marks which he hath not that lowliness meekness and obedience nor yet can the spirit of the god of truth bear witness to a lie or testify that he is a child of god when he is manifestly a child of the devil  discover thyself thou poor selfdeceiver  thou who art confident of being a child of god thou who sayest i have the witness in myself and thereforedefiest all thy enemies thou art weighed in the balance and found wanting even in the balance of the sanctuary the word of the lord hath tried thy soul and proved thee to be reprobate silver thou art not lowly of heart therefore thou hast not received the spirit of jesus unto this day thou art not gentle and meek therefore thy joy is nothing worth it is not joy in the lord thou dost not keep his commandments therefore thoulovest him not neither art thou partaker of the holy ghost it is consequently as certain and as evident as the oracles of god can make it his spirit doth not bear witness with thy spirit that thou art a child of god o cry unto him that the scales may fall off thine eyes that thou mayst know thyself as thou art known that thou mayest receive the sentence of death in thyself till thou hear the voice that raises the dead saying be of good cheer thy sins are forgiven thy faith hath made thee whole but how may one who has the real witness in himself distinguish it from presumption how i pray do you distinguish day from night how do you distinguish light from darkness or the light of a star or glimmering taper from the light of the noonday sun is there not an inherent obvious essential difference between the one and the other and do you not immediately and directly perceive that difference provided your senses are rightly disposed in like manner there is an inherent essential difference between spiritual light and spiritual darkness and between the light wherewith the sun of righteousness shines upon our heart and that glimmering light which arises only from sparks of our own kindling and this difference also is immediately and directly perceived if our spiritual senses are rightly disposed to require a more minute and philosophical account of the manner whereby we distinguish these and of the criteria or intrinsic marks whereby we know the voice of god is to make a demand which   can never be answered no not by one who has the deepest knowledge of god suppose when paul answered before agrippa the wise roman had said thoutalkest of hearing the voice of the son of god how dost thou know it was his voice by what criteria what intrinsic marks dost thou know the voice of god explain to me the manner of distinguishing this from a human or angelic voice can you believe the apostle himself would have once attempted to answer so idle a demand and yet doubtless the moment he heard that voice he knew it was the voice of god but how he knew this who is able to explain perhaps neither man nor angel to come yet closer suppose god were now to speak to any soul thy sins are forgiven thee  he must be willing that soul should know his voice otherwise he would speak in vain and he is able to effect this for whenever he wills to do is present with him and he does effect it that soul is absolutely assured this voice is the voice of god but yet he who hath that witness in himself cannot explain it to one who hath it not nor indeed is it to be expected that he should were there any natural medium to prove or natural method to explain the things of god to unexperienced men then the natural man might discern and know the things of the spirit of god but this is utterly contrary to the assertion of the apostle that he cannot know them because they are spiritually discerned 1 cor 214 even by spiritual senses which the natural man hath not but how shall i know that my spiritual senses are rightly disposed this also is a question of vast importance for if a man mistake in this he may run on in endless error and delusion and how am i assured that this is not my case and that i do not mistake the voice of the spirit even by the testimony of your own spirit by the answer of a good conscience toward god acts 231 by the fruits which he hath wrought in your spirit you shall know the testimony of the spirit of god hereby you shall know that you are in no delusion that you have not deceived your own soul the immediate fruits of the spirit ruling in the heart are love joy peace bowels of mercies humbleness of mind meekness gentleness longsuffering gal 522 23 and the outward fruits are the doing good to all men the doing no evil to any and the walking in the light 1 john 17  a zealous uniform obedience to all the commandments of god by the same fruits shall you distinguish this voice of god from any delusion of the devil that proud spirit cannot humble thee before god he neither can nor would soften thy heart and melt it first into earnest mourning after god and then into filial love it is not the adversary of god and man that enables thee to love thy neighbour or to put on meekness gentleness patience temperance and the whole armour of god see col 31214eph 611 he is not divided against himself or a destroyer of sin his own work no it is none but the son of god whocometh to destroy the works of the devil 1 john 38 as surely therefore as holiness is of god and as sin is the work of the devil so surely the witness thou hast in thyself is not of satan but of god well then mayst thou say thanks be unto god for his unspeakable gift 2 cor 915 thanks be unto god who giveth me to know in whom i have believed 2tim 112 who hath sent forth the spirit of his son into my heart crying abba father gal 46 and even now bearing witness with my spirit that i am a child of god rom 816 and see that not only thy lips but thy life show forth his praise he hath sealed thee for his own glorify him then in thy body and thy spirit which are his 1 cor 620 beloved if thou hast this hope in thyself purify thyself as he is pure while thou beholdest what manner of love the father hath given thee that thou shouldst be called a child of god 1 john 31 cleanse thyself from all filthiness of flesh and spirit perfecting holiness in the fear of god 2 cor 71 and let all thy thoughts words and works be a spiritual sacrifice holy acceptable to god through christ jesus rom 121 2   sermon 11 the witness of the spirit discourse ii the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of godrom 8l6 i 1 none who believe the scriptures to be the word of god can doubt the importance of such a truth as this  a truth revealed therein not once only not obscurely not incidentally but frequently and that in express terms but solemnly and of set purpose as denoting one of the peculiar privileges of the children of god and it is the more necessary to explain and defend this truth because there is a danger on the right hand and on the left if we deny it there is a danger lest our religion degenerate into mere formality lest having a form of godliness we neglect if not deny the power of it if we allow it but do not understand what we allow we are liable to run into all the wildness of enthusiasm it is therefore needful in the highest degree to guard those who fear god from both those dangers by a scriptural and rational illustration and confirmation of this momentous truth it may seem something of this kind is the more needful because so little has been wrote on the subject with any clearness unless some discourses on the wrong side of the question which explain it quite away and it cannot be doubted but these were occasioned at least in a great measure by the crude unscriptural irrational explication of others who knew not what they spake nor whereof they affirmed it more nearly concerns the methodists so called clearly to understand explain and defend this doctrine because it is one grand part of the testimony which god has given them to bear to all mankind it is by this peculiar blessing upon them in searching the scriptures confirmed by the experience of his children that this great evangelical truth has been recovered which had been or many years well nigh lost and forgotten ii 1 but what is the witness of the spirit the original word martyria may be rendered either as it is in several places the witness or less ambiguously the testimony or the record so it is rendered in our translation 1 john 511 this is the record the testimony the sum of what god testifies in all the inspired writings that god hath given unto us eternal life and this life is in his son the testimony now under consideration is given by the spirit of god to and with our spirit he is the person testifying what he testifies to us is that we are the children of god the immediate result of this testimony is the fruit of the spirit namely love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness and without these the testimony itself cannot continue for it is inevitably destroyed not only by the commission of any outward sin or the omission of known duty but by giving way to any inward sin in a word by whatever grieves the holy spirit of god i observed many years ago it is hard to find words in the language of men to explain the deep things of god indeed there are none that will adequately express what the spirit of god works in his children but perhaps one might say desiring any who are taught of god to correct soften or strengthen the expression by the testimony of the spirit i mean an inward impression on the soul whereby the spirit of god immediately and directly witnesses to my spirit that i am a child of god that jesus christ hath loved me and given himself for me that all my sins are blotted out and i even i am reconciled to god after twenty years further consideration i see no cause to retract any part of this neither do i conceive how any of these expressions may be altered so as to make them more intelligible i can only add that if any of the children of god will point out any other expressions which are more clear or more agreeable to the word of god i will readily lay these aside   meantime let it be observed i do not mean hereby that the spirit of god testifies this by any outward voice no nor always by an inward voice although he may do this sometimes neither do i suppose that he always applies to the heart though he often may one or more texts of scripture but he so works upon the soul by his immediate influence and by a strong though inexplicable operation that the stormy wind and troubled waves subside and there is a sweet calm the heart resting as in the arms of jesus and the sinner being clearly satisfied that god is reconciled that all his iniquities are forgiven and his sins covered now what is the matter of dispute concerning this not whether there be a witness or testimony of the spirit not whether the spirit does testify with our spirit that we are the children of god none can deny this without flatly contradicting the scriptures and charging a lie upon the god of truth therefore that there is a testimony of the spirit is acknowledged by all parties neither is it questioned whether there is an indirect witness or testimony that we are the children of god this is nearly if not exactly the same with the testimony of a good conscience towards god and is the result of reason or reflection on what we feel in our own souls strictly speaking it is a conclusion drawn partly from the word of god and partly from our own experience the word of god says every one who has the fruit of the spirit is a child of god experience or inward consciousness tells me that i have the fruit of the spirit and hence i rationally conclude therefore i am a child of god this is likewise allowed on all hands and so is no matter of controversy nor do we assert that there can be any real testimony of the spirit without the fruit of the spirit we assert on the contrary that the fruit of the spirit immediately springs from this testimony not always indeed in the same degree even when the testimony is first given and much less afterwards neither joy nor peace is always at one stay no nor love as neither is the testimony itself always equally strong and clear but the point in question is whether there be any direct testimony of the spirit at all whether there be any other testimony of the spirit than that which arises from a consciousness of the fruit iii 1 i believe there is because that is the plain natural meaning of the text the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of god it is manifest here are two witnesses mentioned who together testify the same thing the spirit of god and our own spirit the late bishop of london in his sermon on this text seems astonished that any one can doubt of this which appears upon the very face of the words now the testimony of our own spirit says the bishop is one which is the consciousness of our own sincerity or to express the same thing a little more clearly the consciousness of the fruit of the spirit when our spirit is conscious of this of love peace longsuffering gentleness goodness it easily infers from these premises that we are the children of god it is true that great man supposed the other witness to be the consciousness of our won good works this he affirms is the testimony of gods spirit but this is included in the testimony of our own spirit yea and in sincerity even according to the common sense of the word so the apostle our rejoicing in this the testimony our conscience that in simplicity and godly sincerity refers to our words and actions as least as much as to our inward dispositions so that this is not another witness but the very same that he mentioned before the consciousness of our good works being only one branch of the consciousness of our sincerity consequently here is only one witness still if therefore the text speaks of two witnesses one of these is not the consciousness of our good works neither of our sincerity all this being manifestly contained in the testimony of our spirit what then is the other witness this might easily be learned if the text itself were not sufficiently clear from the verse immediately preceding ye have received not the spirit of bondage but the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father it follows the spirit itselfbeareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of god this is farther explained by the parallel text gal 46 because ye are sons god hath sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying abba father is not this something immediate and direct not the result of reflection or argumentation does not his spirit cry abba father in our hearts the moment it is given antecedently to any reflection upon our sincerity yea to any reasoning   whatsoever and is not this the plain natural sense of the words which strikes any one as soon as he hears them all these texts then in their most obvious meaning describe a direct testimony of the spirit 5 that the testimony of the spirit of god must in the very nature of things be antecedent to the testimony of our own spirit may appear from this single consideration we must be holy in heart and life before we can be conscious that we are so but we must love god before we can be holy at all this being the root of holiness now we cannot love god till we know he loves us we love him because he first loved us and we cannot know his love to us till his spirit witnesses it to our spirit till then we cannot believe it we cannot say the life which i now live i live by faith in the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me then only then we feel our interest in his blood and cry with joy unspeakable thou art my lord my god since therefore the testimony of his spirit must precede the love of god and all holiness of consequence it must precede our consciousness thereof 6 and here properly comes in to confirm this scriptural doctrine the experience of the children of god the experience not of two or three not of a few but of a great multitude which no man can number it has been confirmed both in this and in all ages by a cloud of living and dying witnesses it is confirmed by your experience and mine the spirit itself bore witness to my spirit that i was a child of god gave me an evidence hereof and i immediately cried abba father and this i did and so did you before i reflected on or was conscious of any fruit of the spirit it was from this testimony received that love joy peace and the whole fruit of the spirit flowed first i heard  thy sins are forgiven accepted thou art  i listen and heaven sprung up in my heart 7 but this is confirmed not only by experience of the children of god  thousands of whom can declare that they never did know themselves to be in the favour of god till it was directly witnessed to them by his spirit but by all those who are convinced of sin who feel the wrath of god abiding on them these cannot be satisfied with any thing less than a direct testimony from his spirit that he is merciful to their unrighteousness and remembers their sins and iniquities no more tell any of these you are to know you are a child by reflecting on what he has wrought in you on your love joy and peace and will he not immediately reply by all this i know i am a child of the devil i have no more love to god than the devil has my carnal mind is enmity against god i have no joy in the holy ghost my soul is sorrowful even unto death i have no peace my heart is a troubled sea i am all storm and tempest and which way can these souls possibly be comforted but by a divine testimony not that they are good or sincere or conformable to the scripture in heart and life but that god justifieth the ungodly him that till the moment he is justified is all ungodly void of all true holiness him that worketh not that worketh nothing that is truly good till he is conscious that he is accepted not for any works of righteousness which he hath done but by the mere free mercy of god wholly and solely for what the son of god hath done and suffered for him and can it be any otherwise if a man is justified by faith without the works of the law if so what inward or outward goodness can he be conscious of antecedent to his justification nay is not the having nothing to pay that is the being conscious that there dwelleth in us no good thing neither inward nor outward goodness essentially indispensably necessary before we can be justified freely through the redemption that is in jesus christ was ever any man justified since his coming into the world or can any man ever be justified till he is brought to that point   i give up every plea beside  lord i am damnd but thou has died every one therefore who denies the existence of such a testimony does in effect deny justification by faith it follows that either he never experienced this either he never was justified or that be has forgotten as st peter speaks ta katharismou ton palai autou hamartion the purification from his former sins the experience he then had himself the manner wherein god wrought in his own soul when his former sins were blotted out and the experience even of the children of the world here confirms that of the children of god many of these have a desire to please god some of them take much pains to please him but do they not one and all count it the highest absurdity for any to talk of knowing his sins are forgiven which of them even pretends to any such thing and yet many of them are conscious of their own sincerity many of them undoubtedly have in a degree the testimony of their own spirit a consciousness of their own uprightness but this brings them no consciousness that they are forgiven no knowledge that they are the children of god yea the more sincere they are the more uneasy they generally are for want of knowing it plainly showing that this cannot be known in a satisfactory manner by the bare testimony of our own spirit without gods directly testifying that we are his children iv but abundance of objections have been made to this the chief of which it may be well to consider it is objected first experience is not sufficient to prove a doctrine which is not founded on scripture this is undoubtedly true and it is an important truth but it does not affect the present question for it has been shown that this doctrine is founded on scripture therefore experience is properly alleged to confirm it but madmen french prophets and enthusiasts of every kind have imagined they experienced this witness they have so and perhaps not a few of them did although they did not retain it long but if they did not this is no proof at all that others have not experienced it as a madmans imagining himself a king does not prove that there are no real kings nay many who pleaded strongly for this have utterly decried the bible perhaps so but this was no necessary consequence thousands plead for it who have the highest esteem for the bible yea but many have fatally deceived themselves hereby and got above all conviction and yet a scriptural doctrine is no worse though men abuse it to their own destruction but i lay it down as an undoubted truth the fruit of the spirit is the witness of the spirit not undoubted thousands doubt of yea flatly deny it but let that pass if this witness be sufficient there is no need of any other but it is sufficient unless in one of these cases 1 the total absence of the fruit of the spirit and this is the case when the direct witness is first given 2 the not perceiving it but to contend for it in this case is to contend for being in the favour of god and not knowing it true not knowing it at that time any otherwise than by the testimony which is given for that end and this we do contend for we contend that the direct witness may shine clear even while the indirect one is under a cloud it is objected secondly the design of the witness contended for is to prove that the profession we make is genuine but it does not prove this i answer the proving this is not the design of it it is antecedent to our making any profession at all but that of being lost undone guilty helpless sinners it is designed to assure those to whom it is given that they are the children of god that they are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in jesus christ and this does not suppose that their preceding thoughts words and actions are conformable to the rule of scripture it supposes quite the reverse namely that they are sinners all over sinners both in heart and life were it otherwise god would justify the godly and their own works would be counted to them for righteousness and i cannot but fear that a supposition of our being justified by works is at the root of all these objections for whoever cordially believes that god imputes to all that are justified   righteousness without works will find no difficulty in allowing the witness of his spirit preceding the fruit of it it is objected thirdly one evangelist says your heavenly father will give the holy spirit to them that ask him the other evangelist calls the same thing good gifts abundantly demonstrating that the spirits way of bearing witness is by giving good gifts nay here is nothing at all about bearing witness either in the one text or the other therefore till this demonstration is better demonstrated i let it stand as it is it is objected fourthly the scripture says the tree is known by its fruits prove all things try the spirits examine yourselves most true therefore let every man who believes he hath the witness in himself try whether it be of god if the fruit follow it is otherwise it is not for certainly the tree is known by its fruit hereby we prove if it be of god but the direct witness is never referred to in the book of god not as standing alone not as a single witness but as connected with the other as giving a joint testimony testifying with our spirit that we are children of god and who is able to prove that it is not thus referred to in this very scripture examine yourselves whether ye be in the faith prove your own selves know ye not yourownselves that jesus christ is in you it is by no means clear that they did not know this by a direct as well as a remote witness how is it proved that they did not know it first by an inward consciousness and then by love joy and peace  but the testimony arising from the internal and external change is constantly referred to in the bible it is so and we constantly refer thereto to confirm the testimony of the spirit nay all the marks you have given whereby to distinguish the operations of gods spirit from delusion refer to the change wrought in us and upon us this likewise is undoubtedly true 8 it is objected fifthly that the direct witness of the spirit does not secure us from the greatest delusion and is that a witness fit to be trusted whose testimony cannot be depended on that is forced to fly to something else to prove what it asserts i answer to secure us from all delusion god gives us two witnesses that we are his children and this they testify conjointly therefore what god hath joined together let no man put asunder and while they are joined we cannot be deluded their testimony can be depended on they are fit to be trusted in the highest degree and need nothing else to prove what they assert nay the direct witness only asserts but does not prove any thing by two witnesses shall every word be established and when the spirit witnesses with our spirit as god designs it to do then it fully proves that we are children of god it is objected sixthly you own the change wrought is a sufficient testimony unless in the case of severe trials such as that of our saviour upon the cross but none of us can be tried in that manner but you or i may be tried in such a manner and so may any other child of god that it will be impossible for us to keep our filial confidence in god without the direct witness of his spirit it is objected lastly the greatest contenders for it are some of the proudest and most uncharitable of men perhaps some of the hottest contenders for it are both proud and uncharitable but many of the firmest contenders for it are eminently meek and lowly in heart and indeed in all other respects also true followers of their lamblike lord the preceding objections are the most considerable that i have heard and i believe contain the strength of the cause yet i apprehend whoever calmly and impartially considers those objections and the answers together will easily see that they do not destroy no nor weaken the evidence of that great truth that the spirit of god does directly as well as indirectly testify that we are children of god   v 1 the sum of all this is the testimony of the spirit is an inward impression on the souls of believers whereby the spirit of god directly testifies to their spirit that they are children of god and it is not questioned whether there is a testimony of the spirit but whether there is an direct testimony whether there is any other than that which arises from a consciousness of the fruit of the spirit we believe there is because this is the plain natural meaning of the text illustrated both by the preceding words and by the parallel passage in the epistle to thegalatians because in the nature of the thing the testimony must precede the fruit which springs from it and because this plain meaning of the word of god is confirmed by the experience of innumerable children of god yea and by the experience of all who are convinced of sin who can never rest till they have a direct witness and even of the children of the world who not having the witness in themselves one and all declare none can know his sins forgiven  and whereas it is objected that experience is not sufficient to prove a doctrine unsupported by scripture  that madmen and enthusiasts of every kind have imagined such a witness that the design of that witness is to prove our profession genuine which design it does not answer  that the scripture says the tree is known by its fruit examine yourselves prove yourownselves and meantime the direct witness is never referred to in all the book of god  that it does not secure us from the greatest delusions and lastly that the change wrought in us is a sufficient testimony unless in such trials as christ alone suffered  we answer 1 experience is sufficient to confirm a doctrine which is grounded on scripture 2 though many fancy they experience what they do not this is no prejudice to real experience 3the design of that witness is to assure us we are children of god and this design it does answer 4 the true witness of the spirit is known by its fruit love peace joy not indeed preceding but following it 5 it cannot be proved that the direct as well as the indirect witness is not referred to in that very text know ye not yourownselves that jesus christ is in you 6 the spirit of god witnessing with our spirit does secure us from all delusion and lastly we are all liable to trials wherein the testimony of our own spirit is not sufficient wherein nothing less than the direct testimony of gods spirit can assure us that we are his children two inferences may be drawn from the whole the first let none ever presume to rest in any supposed testimony of the spirit which is separate from the fruit of it if the spirit of god does really testify that we are the children of god the immediate consequence will be the fruit of the spirit even love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness fidelity meekness temperance and however this fruit may be clouded for a while during the time of strong temptation so that it does not appear to the tempted person while satan is sifting him as wheat yet the substantial part of it remains even under the thickest cloud it is true joy in the holy ghost may be withdrawn during the hour of trial yea the soul may be exceeding sorrowful while the hour and power of darkness continue but even this is generally restored with increase till we rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory the second inference is let none rest in any supposed fruit of the spirit without the witness there may be foretastes of the spirit without the witness there may be foretastes of joy of peace of love and those not delusive but really from god long before we have the witness in ourselves before the spirit of god witnesses with our spirits that we have redemption in the blood of jesus even the forgiveness of sins yea there may be a degree of longsuffering of gentleness of fidelity meekness temperance not a shadow thereof but a real degree by the preventing grace of god before we are accepted in the beloved and consequently before we have a testimony of our acceptance but it is by no means advisable to rest here it is at the peril of our souls if we do if we are wise we shall be continually crying to god until his spirit cry in our heart abba father this is the privilege of all the children of god and without this we can never be assured that we are his children without this we cannot retain a steady peace nor avoid perplexing doubts and fears but when we have once received this spirit of adoption this peace whichpasseth all understanding and which expels all painful doubt and fear will keep our hearts and minds in christ jesus and when this has brought forth its genuine fruit all inward and outward holiness it is undoubtedly the will of him thatcalleth us to give us always what he has once given so that there is no need that we should ever more be deprived of either the testimony of gods spirit or the testimony of our own the consciousness of our walking in all righteousness and true holiness newry april 4 1767   sermon 12 text of the 1872 edition the witness of our own spirit this is our rejoicing the testimony of out conscience that in simplicity and godly sincerity not with fleshly wisdom but by the grace of god we have had our conversation in the world 2 cor 112 such is the voice of every true believer in christ so long as he abides in faith and love he that followeth me saith our lord walketh not in darkness and while he hath the light he rejoiceth therein as he hath received the lord jesus christ so hewalketh in him and while he walketh in him the exhortation of the apostle takes place in his soul day by day rejoice in the lord always and again i say rejoice but that we may not build our house upon the sand lest when the rains descend and the winds blow and the floods arise and beat up it it fall and great be the fall thereof i intend in the following discourse to show what is the nature and ground of a christians joy we know in general it is that happy peace that calm satisfaction of spirit which arises from such a testimony of his conscience as is here described by the apostle but in order to understand this the more thoroughly it will be requisite to weigh all his words whence will easily appear both what we are to understand by conscience and what by the testimony thereof and also how he that hath this testimonyrejoiceth evermore  and first what are we to understand by conscience what is the meaning of this word that is in every ones mouth one would imagine it was an exceedingly difficult thing to discover this when we consider how large and numerous volumes have been from time to time wrote on this subject and how all the treasures of ancient and modern learning have been ransacked in order to explain it and yet it is to be feared it has not received much light from all those elaborate inquiries rather have not most of those writers puzzled the cause darkening counsel by words without knowledge perplexing a subject plain in itself and easy to be understood for set aside but hard words and every man of an honest heart will soon understand the thing god has made us thinking beings capable of perceiving what is present and of reflecting or looking back on what is past in particular we are capable of perceiving whatsoever passes in our own hearts or lives of knowing whatsoever we feel or do and that either while it passes or when it is past this we mean when we say man is a conscious being he hath a consciousness or inward perception both of things present and past relating to himself of his own tempers and outwardbehavior but what we usually term conscience implies somewhat more than this it is not barely the knowledge of our present or the remembrance of our preceding life to remember to bear witness either of past or present things is only one and the least office of conscience its main business is to excuse or accuse to approve or disapprove to acquit or condemn some latter writers indeed have given a new name to this and have chose to style it a moral sense but the old word seems preferable to the new were it only on this account that it is more common and familiar among men and therefore easier to be understood and to christians it is undeniably preferable on another account also namely because it is scriptural because it is the word which the wisdom of god hath chose to use in the inspired writings and according to the meaning wherein it is generally used there particularly in the epistles of st paul we may understand by conscience a faculty or power implanted by god in every soul that comes into the world of perceiving what is right or wrong in his own heart or life in his tempers thoughts words and actions 6 but what is the rule whereby men are to judge of right and wrong whereby their conscience is to be directed the rule of heathens as the apostle teaches elsewhere is the law written in their hearts by the finger of god their conscience also bearing witness whether they walk by this rule   or not and their thoughts the mean while accusing or even excusing acquitting defending them he kai apologoumenon rom 214 15 but the christian rule of right and wrong is the word of god the writings of the old and new testament all that the prophets and holy men of old wrote as they were moved by the holy ghost all that scripture which was given by inspiration of god and which is indeed profitable for doctrine or teaching the whole will of god for reproof of what is contrary thereto for correction or error and for instruction or training us up in righteousness 2 tim 316 this is a lantern unto a christians feet and a light in all his paths this alone he receives as his rule of right or wrong of whatever is really good or evil he esteems nothing good but what is here enjoined either directly or by plain consequence he accounts nothing evil but what is here forbidden either in terms or by undeniable inference whatever the scripture neither forbids nor enjoins either directly or by plain consequence he believes to be of an indifferent nature to be in itself neither good nor evil this being the whole and sole outward rule whereby his conscience is to be directed in all things  and if it be directed thereby in fact then hath he the answer of a good conscience toward god a good conscience is what is elsewhere termed by the apostle a conscience void of fense so what he at one time expresses thus i have lived in all good conscience before god until this day acts 231 he denotes at another by that expression herein do i exercise myself to have always a conscience void ofoffense toward god and toward men acts 2416 now in order to this there is absolutely required first a right understanding of the word of god or his holy and acceptable and perfect will concerning us as it is revealed therein for it is impossible we should walk by a rule if we do not know what it means there is secondly required which how few have attained a true knowledge of ourselves a knowledge both of our hearts and lives or our inward tempers and outward conversation seeing if we know them not it is not possible that we should compare them with our rule there is required thirdly an agreement of our hearts and lives or our tempers and conversation or our thoughts and words and works with that rule with the written word of god for without this if we have any conscience at all it can be only an evil conscience there is fourthly required an inward perception of this agreement with our rule and this habitual perception this inward consciousness itself is properly a good conscience or in other phrase of the apostle a conscience void ofoffense toward god and toward men but whoever desires to have a conscience thus void of offence let him see that he lay the right foundation let him remember other foundation of this can no man lay than that which is laid even jesus christ and let him also be mindful that no manbuildeth on him but by a living faith that no man is a partaker of christ until he can clearly testify the life which i now live i live by faith in the son of god in him who is now revealed in my heart who loved me and gave himself for me faith alone is that evidence that conviction that demonstration of things invisible whereby the eyes of our understanding being opened and divine light poured in upon them we see the wondrous things of gods law the excellency and purity of it the height and depth and length and breadth thereof and of every commandment contained therein it is by faith that beholding the light of the glory of god in the face of jesus christ we perceive as in a glass all that is in ourselves yea the inmost motions of our souls and by this alone can that blessed love of god be shed abroad in our hearts which enables us so to love one another as christ loved us by this is that gracious promise fulfilled unto all the israel of god i will put my laws into their mind and write or engrave them in their hearts heb 810 hereby producing in their souls an entire agreement with his holy and perfect law and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of christ and as an evil tree cannot bring forth good fruit so a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit as the heart therefore of a believer so likewise his life is thoroughly conformed to the rule of gods commandments in a consciousness whereof he can give glory to god and say with the apostle this is our rejoicing the testimony of our conscience that in simplicity and godly sincerity not with fleshly wisdom but by the grace of god we have had our conversation in the world 9 we have had our conversation the apostle in the original expresses this by one single word anestaphemen but the meaning thereof is exceeding broad taking in our whole deportment yea every inward as well as outward circumstance whether relating to our soul or body it includes every   motion of our heart of our tongue or our hands and bodily members it extends to all our actions and words to the employment of all our powers and faculties to the manner of using every talent we have received with respect either to god or man we have had our conversation in the world even in the world of the ungodly not only among the children of god that were comparatively a little thing but among the children of the devil among those that lie in wickedness entoi poneroi in the wicked one what a world is this how thoroughly impregnated with the spirit it continually breathes as our god is good and doeth good so the god of this world and all his children are evil and do evil so far as they are suffered to all the children of god like their father they are always lying in wait or walking about seeking whom they may devour using fraud or force secret wiles or open violence to destroy those who are not of the world continually warring against our souls and by old or new weapons and devices of every kind labouring to bring them back into the snare of the devil into the broad road thatleadeth to destruction  we have had our whole conversation in such a world in simplicity and godly sincerity first in simplicity this is what our lord recommends under the name of a single eye the light of the body saith he is the eye if therefore thine eye be single the whole body shall be full of light the meaning whereof is this what the eye is to the body that the intention is to all the words and actions if therefore this eye of thy soul be single all thy actions and conversation shall be full of light of the light of heaven of love and peace and joy in the holy ghost we are then simple of heart when the eye of our mind is singly fixed on god when in all things we aim at god alone as our god our portion our strength our happiness our exceeding great reward our all in time and eternity this is simplicity when a steady view a single intention of promoting his glory of doing and suffering his blessed will runs through our whole soul fills all our heart and is the constant spring of all our thoughts desires and purposes we have had our conversation in the world secondly in godly sincerity the difference between simplicity and sincerity seems to be chiefly this simplicity regards the intention itself sincerity the execution of it and this sincerity relates not barely to our words but to our whole conversation as described above it is not here to be understood in that narrow sense wherein st paul himself sometimes uses it for speaking the truth or abstaining from guile from craft and dissimulation but in a more extensive meaning as actually hitting the mark which we aim at by simplicity accordingly it implies in this place that we do in fact speak and do all to the glory of god that all our words are not only pointed at this but actually conducive thereto that all our actions flow on in an even stream uniformly subservient to this great end and that in our whole lives we are moving straight toward god and that continually walking steadily on in the highway of holiness in the paths of justice mercy and truth  this sincerity is termed by the apostle godly sincerity or the sincerity of godeilikrineiai theou to prevent our mistaking or confounding it with the sincerity of the heathens for they had also a kind of sincerity among them for which they professed no small veneration likewise to denote the object and end of this as of every christian virtue seeing whatever does not ultimately tend to god sinks among the beggarly elements of the world by styling it the sincerity of god he also points out the author or it the father of lights from whom every good and perfect giftdescendeth which is still more clearly declared in the following words not with fleshly wisdom  but by the grace of god  14 not with fleshly wisdom as if he had said we cannot thus converse in the world by any natural strength of understanding neither by any naturally acquired knowledge or wisdom we cannot gain this simplicityor practise this sincerity by the force either of good sense good nature or good breeding it overshoots all our native courage and resolution as well as all our precepts of philosophy the power of custom is not able to train us up to this nor the most exquisite rules of human education neither could i paul ever attain hereto notwithstanding all the advantages i enjoyed so long as i was in the flesh in my natural state and pursued it only by fleshly natural wisdom   and yet surely if any man could paul himself might have attained thereto by that wisdom for we can hardly conceive any who was more highly favoured with all the gifts both of nature and education besides his natural abilities probably not inferior to those of any person then up the earth he had all the benefits of learning studying at the university of tarsus afterwards brought up at the feet of gamaliel a person of the greatest account both for knowledge and integrity that was then in the whole jewish nation and he had all the possible advantages of religious education being pharisee the son of a pharisee trained up in the very straitest sect or profession distinguished from all others by a more eminent strictness and herein he had profited above many others who were his equals in years being more abundantly zealous of whatever he thought would please god and as touching the righteousness of the law blameless but it could not be that he should hereby attain this simplicity and godly sincerity it was all but lost labour in a deep piercing sense of which he was at length constrained to cry out the things which were gain to me those i counted loss for the excellency of the knowledge of christ jesus my lord phil 37 8 it could not be that ever he should attain to this but by the excellent knowledge of jesus christ our lord or by the grace of god  another expression of nearly the same import by the grace of god is sometimes to be understood that free love that unmerited mercy by which i a sinner through the merits of christ am now reconciled to god but in this place it rather means that power of god the holy ghost which worketh in us both to will and to do of his good pleasure as soon as ever the grace of god in the former sense his pardoning love is manifested to our souls the grace of god in the latter sense the power of his spirit takes place therein and now we can perform through god what to man was impossible now we can order our conversation aright we can do all things in the light and power of that love through christ whichstrengtheneth us we now have the testimony of our conscience which we could never have by fleshly wisdom that in simplicity and godly sincerity we have our conversation in the world this is properly the ground of a christians joy we may now therefore readily conceive how he that hath this testimony in himself rejoiceth evermore my soul may he say doth magnify the lord and my spirit rejoiceth in god my saviour i rejoice in him who of his own unmerited love of his own free and tender mercy hath called me into this state of salvation wherein through his power i now stand i rejoice because his spiritbeareth witness to my spirit that i am bought with the blood of the lamb and that believing in him i am a member of christ a child of god and an inheritor of the kingdom of heaven i rejoice because the sense of gods love to me hath by the same spirit wrought in me to love him and to love for his sake every child of man every soul that hath made i rejoice because he gives me to feel in myself the mind that was in christ  simplicity a single eye to him in every motion of my heart power always to fix the loving eye of my soul on him who loved me and gave himself for me to aim at him alone at his glorious will in all i think or speak or do  purity desiring nothing more but god crucifying the flesh with its affections and lusts setting my affections on things above not on things of the earth  holiness a recovery of the image of god a renewal of soul after his likeness  and godly sincerity directing all my words and works so as to conduce to his glory in this i likewise rejoice yea and will rejoice because my conscience beareth me witness in the holy ghost by the light he continually pours in upon it that walk worthy of the vocation wherewith i am called that i abstain from all appearance of evil fleeing from sin as from the face of a serpent that as i have opportunity i do all possible good in every kind to all men that i follow my lord in all my steps and do what is acceptable in his sight i rejoice because i both see and feel through the inspiration of gods holy spirit that all my works are wrought in him yea and that it is he whoworketh all my works in me i rejoice in seeing through the light of god which shines in my heart that i have power to walk in his ways and that through his grace i turn not therefrom to the right hand or to the left  such is the ground and the nature of that joy whereby an adult christianrejoiceth evermore and from all this we may easily infer first that this is not a natural joy it does not arise from any natural cause not from any sudden flow of spirits this may give a transient start of joy but the christian rejoiceth always it cannot be owing to bodily health or ease to strength and soundness of constitution for it is equally strong in sickness and pain yea perhaps far stronger than before many christians have never experienced any joy to be compared with that which then filled their soul when the body was well nigh worn out with pain or consumed away with pining sickness least of all can it be ascribed to outward prosperity to the favour of men or plenty of worldly goods for then   chiefly when their faith has been tried as with fire by all manner of outward afflictions have the children of god rejoiced in him whom unseen they loved even with joy unspeakable and never surely did men rejoice like those who were used as the filth and off scouring of the world who wandered to and fro being in want of all things in hunger in cold in nakedness who had trials not only of cruel mockings but moreover of bonds and imprisonments yea who at last counted not their lives dear unto themselves so they might finish their course with joy from the preceding considerations we may secondly infer that the joy of a christian does not arise from any blindness of conscience from his not being able to discern good from evil so far from it that he was an utter stranger to this joy till the eyes of his understanding were opened that he knew it not until he had spiritual senses fitted to discern spiritual good and evil and now the eye of his soul waxeth not dim he was never so sharpsighted before he has so quick a perception of the smallest things as is quite amazing to the natural man as a mote is visible in the sunbeam so to him who is walking in the light in the beams of the uncreated sun every mote of sin is visible nor does he close the eyes of his conscience any more that sleep is departed from him his soul is always broad awake no more slumber or folding of the hands to rest he is always standing on the tower and hearkening what his lord will say concerning him and always rejoicing in this very thing in seeing him that is invisible  neither does the joy of a christian arise thirdly from anydulness or callousness of conscience a kind of joy it is true may arise from this in those whose foolish hearts are darkened whose heart is callous unfeeling dull of sense and consequently without spiritual understanding because of their senseless unfeeling hearts they may rejoice even in committing sin and this they may probably call liberty  which is indeed mere drunkenness of soul a fatal numbness of spirit the stupid insensibility of a sacred conscience on the contrary a christian has the most exquisite sensibility such as he could not have conceived before he never had such a tenderness of conscience as he has had since the love of god has reigned in his heart and this also is his glory and joy that god hath heard his daily prayer   o that my tender soul might fly the first abhorrd approach of ill quick as the apple of an eye the slightest touch of sin to feel 20 to conclude christian joy is joy in obedience joy in loving god and keeping his commandments and yet not in keeping them as if we were thereby to fulfil the terms of the covenant of works as if by any works or righteousness of ours we were to procure pardon and acceptance with god not so we are already pardoned and accepted through the mercy of god in christ jesus not as if we were by our own obedience to procure life life from the death of sin this also we have already through the grace of god us hath he quickened who were dead in sins and now we are alive to god through jesus christ our lord but we rejoice in walking according to the covenant of grace in holy love and happy obedience we rejoice in knowing that being justified through his grace we have not received that grace of god in vain that god having freely not for the sake of our willing or running but through the blood of the lamb reconciled us to himself we run in the strength which he hath given us the way of his commandments he hath girded us with strength unto the war and we gladly fight the good fight of faith we rejoice through him wholiveth in our hearts by faith to lay hold of eternal life this is our rejoicing that as our fatherworketh hitherto so not by our own might or wisdom but through the power of his spirit freely given in christ jesus we also work the works of god and may he work in us whatsoever is wellpleasing in his sight to whom be the praise for ever and ever it may easily be observed that the preceding discourse describes the experience of those that are strong in faith but hereby those that are weak in faith may be discouraged to prevent which the following discourse may be of use   sermon 13 on sin in believers if any man be in christ he is a new creature 2 cor 517 i 1 is there then sin in him that is in christ does sin remain in one that believes in him is there any sin in them that are born of god or are they wholly delivered from it let no one imagine this to be a question of mere curiosity or that it is of little importance whether it be determined one way or the other rather it is a point of the utmost moment to every serious christian the resolving of which very nearly concerns both his present and eternal happiness and yet i do not know that ever it was controverted in the primitive church indeed there was no room for disputing concerning it as all christians were agreed and so far as i have observed the whole body of ancient christians who have left us anything in writing declare with one voice that even believers in christ till they are strong in the lord and in the power of his might have need to wrestle with flesh and blood with an evil nature as well as with principalities and powers and herein our own church as indeed in most points exactly copies after the primitive declaring in her ninth article original sin is the corruption of the nature of every man whereby man is in his own nature inclined to evil so that the fleshlusteth contrary to the spirit and this infection of nature doth remain yea in them that are regenerated whereby the lust of the flesh called in greek phronema sarkos is not subject to the law of god and although there is no condemnation for them that believe yet this lust hath of itself the nature of sin the same testimony is given by all other churches not only by the greek and romish church but by every reformed church in europe of whatever denomination indeed some of these seem to carry the thing too far so describing the corruption of heart in a believer as scarce to allow that he has dominion over it but rather is in bondage thereto and by this means they leave hardly any distinction between a believer and an unbeliever to avoid this extreme many wellmeaning men particularly those under the direction of the late count zinzendorf ran into another affirming that all true believers are not only saved from the dominion of sin but from the being of inward as well as outward sin so that it no longer remains in them and from them about twenty years ago many of our countrymen imbibed the same opinion that even the corruption of nature is no more in those who believe in christ it is true that when the germans were pressed upon this head they soon allowed many of them at least that sin did still remain in the flesh but not in the heart of a believer and after a time when the absurdity of this was shown they fairly gave up the point allowing that sin did still remain though not reign in him that is born of god but the english who had received it from them some directly some at second or third hand were not so easily prevailed upon to part with a favourite opinion and even when the generality of them were convinced it was utterly indefensible a few could not be persuaded to give it up but maintain it to this day ii 1 for the sake of these who really fear god and desire to know the truth as it is in jesus it may not be amiss to consider the point with calmness and impartiality in doing this i use indifferently the words regenerate justified or believers since though they have not precisely the same meaning the first implying an inward actual change the second a relative one and the third the means whereby both the one and the other are wrought yet they come to one and the same thing as everyone that believes is both justified and born of god 2 by sin i here understand inward sin any sinful temper passion or affection such as pride selfwill love of the world in any kind or degree such as lust anger peevishness any disposition contrary to the mind which was in christ   the question is not concerning outward sin whether a child of god commits sin or no we all agree and earnestly maintain he that committeth sin is of the devil we agree whosoever is born of god doth not commit sin neither do we now inquire whether inward sin will always remain in the children of god whether sin will continue in the soul as long as it continues in the body nor yet do we inquire whether a justified person may relapse either into inward or outward sin but simply this is a justified or regenerate man freed from all sin as soon as he is justified is there then no sin in his heart  nor ever after unless he fall from grace we allow that the state of a justified person is inexpressibly great and glorious he is born again not of blood nor of the flesh nor of the will of man but of god he is a child of god a member of christ an heir of the kingdom of heaven the peace of god whichpasseth all understanding keepeth his heart and mind in christ jesus his very body is a temple of the holy ghost and an habitation of god through the spirit he is created anew in christ jesus he is washed he is sanctified his heart is purified by faith he is cleansed from the corruption that is in the world the love of god is shed abroad in his heart by the holy ghost which is given unto him and so long as he walketh in love which he may always do he worships god in spirit and in truth hekeepeth the commandments of god and doeth those things that are pleasing in his sight so exercising himself as to have a conscience void of offence toward god and toward man and he has power both over outward and inward sin even from the moment he is justified iii 1 but was he not then freed from all sin so that there is no sin in his heart i cannot say this i cannot believe it because st paul says the contrary he is speaking to believers and describing the state of believers in general when he says the fleshlusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh these are contrary the one to the other gal 517 nothing can be more express the apostle here directly affirms that the flesh evil nature opposes the spirit even in believers that even in the regenerate there are two principles contrary the one to the other again when he writes to the believers atcorinth to those who were sanctified in christ jesus 1 cor 12 he says i brethren could not speak unto you as unto spiritual but as unto carnal as unto babes in christ ye are yet carnal for whereas there is among you envying and strife are ye not carnal 1 cor 313 now here the apostle speaks unto those who were unquestionably believers  whom in the same breath he styles his brethren in christ  as being still in a measure carnal he affirms there was envying an evil temper occasioning strife among them and yet does not give the least intimation that they had lost their faith nay he manifestly declares they had not for then they would not have been babes in christ and what is most remarkable of all he speaks of being carnal and babes in christ as one and the same thing plainly showing that every believer is in a degree carnal while he is only a babe in christ indeed this grand point that there are two contrary principles in believers  nature and grace the flesh and the spirit runs through all the epistles of st paul yea through all the holy scriptures almost all the directions and exhortations therein are founded on this supposition pointing at wrong tempers or practices in those who are notwithstanding acknowledged by the inspired writers to be believers and they are continually exhorted to fight with and conquer these by the power of the faith which was in them and who can doubt but there was faith in the angel of the church ofephesus when our lord said to him i know thy works and thy labour and thy patience thou hast patience and for my names sake hast laboured and hast not fainted rev 224 but was there meantime no sin in his heart yea or christ would not have added nevertheless i have somewhat against thee because thou hast left thy first love this was real sin which god saw in his heart of which accordingly he is exhorted to repent and yet we have no authority to say that even then he had no faith 5 nay the angel of the church at pergamos also is exhorted to repent which implies sin though our lord expressly says thou hast not denied my faith rev 213 16 and to the angel of the church in sardis he says strengthen the things which remain that are ready to die the good which remained was ready to die but was not actually dead rev 32 so there was still a spark of faith even in him which he is accordingly commanded to hold fast rev 33   6 once more when the apostle exhorts believers to cleanse themselves from all filthiness of flesh and spirit 2 cor 71 he plainly teaches that those believers were not yet cleansed therefrom will you answer he that abstains from all appearance of evil does ipso facto cleanse himself from all filthiness not in any wise for instance a man reviles me i feel resentment which is filthiness of spirit yet i say not a word here i abstain from all appearance of evil but this does not cleanse me from that filthiness of spirit as i experience to my sorrow and as this position there is no sin in a believer no carnal mind no bent to backsliding is thus contrary to the word of god so it is to the experience of his children these continually feel an heart bent to backsliding a natural tendency to evil a proneness to depart from god and cleave to the things of earth they are daily sensible of sin remaining in their heart  pride selfwill unbelief and of sin cleaving to all they speak and do even their best actions and holiest duties yet at the same time they know that they are of god they cannot doubt of it for a moment they feel his spirit clearly witnessing with their spirit that they are the children of god they rejoice in god through christ jesus by whom they have now received the atonement so that they are equally assured that sin is in them and that christ is in them the hope of glory but can christ be in the same heart where sin is undoubtedly he can otherwise it never could be saved therefrom where the sickness is there is the physician carrying on his work within striving till he cast out sin christ indeed cannot reign where sin reigns neither will he dwell where any sin is allowed but he is and dwells in the heart of every believer who is fighting against all sin although it be not yet purified according to the purification of the sanctuary it has been observed before that the opposite doctrine  that there is no sin in believers  is quite new in the church of christ that it was never heard of for seventeen hundred years never till it was discovered by countzinzendorf i do not remember to have seen the least intimation of it either in any ancient or modern writer unless perhaps in some of the wild ranting antinomians and these likewise say and unsay acknowledging there is sin in their flesh although no sin in their heart but whatever doctrine is new must be wrong for the old religion is the only true one and no doctrine can be right unless it is the very same which was from the beginning one argument more against this new unscriptural doctrine may be drawn from the dreadful consequences of it one says i felt anger today must i reply then you have no faith another says i know what you advise is good but my will is quite averse to it must i tell him then you are an unbeliever under the wrath and the curse of god what will be the natural consequence of this why if he believe what i say his soul will not only be grieved and wounded but perhaps utterly destroyed inasmuch as he will cast away that confidence which hath great recompense of reward and having cast away his shield how shall he quench the fiery darts of the wicked one how shall he overcome the world  seeing this is the victory thatovercometh the world even our faith he stands disarmed in the midst of his enemies open to all their assaults what wonder then if he be utterly overthrown if they take him captive at their will yea if he fall from one wickedness to another and never see good any more i cannot therefore by any means receive this assertion that there is no sin in a believer from the moment he is justified first because it is contrary to the whole tenor of scripture  secondly because it is contrary to the experience of the children of god  thirdly because it is absolutely new never heard of in the world till yesterday  and lastly because it is naturally attended with the most fatal consequences not only grieving those whom god hath not grieved but perhaps dragging them into everlasting perdition   iv 1 however let us give a fair hearing to the chief arguments of those who endeavour to support it and it is first from scripture they attempt to prove that there is no sin in a believer they argue thus the scripture says every believer is born of god is clean is holy is sanctified is pure in   heart has a new heart is a temple of the holy ghost now as that which is born of the flesh is flesh is altogether evil so that which is born of the spirit is spirit is altogether good again a man cannot be clean sanctified holy and at the same time unclean unsanctified unholy he cannot be pure and impure or have a new and an old heart together neither can his soul be unholy while it is a temple of the holy ghost i have put this objection as strong as possible that its full weight may appear let us now examine it part by part and 1 that which is born of the spirit is spirit is altogether good i allow the text but not the comment for the text affirms this and no more  that every man who is born of the spirit is a spiritual man he is so but so he may be and yet not be altogether spiritual the christians at corinth were spiritual men else they had been no christians at all and yet they were not altogether spiritual they were still in part carnal  but they were fallen from grace st paul says no they were even then babes in christ 2 but a man cannot be clean sanctified holy and at the same time unclean unsanctified unholy indeed he may so the corinthians were ye are washed says the apostle ye are sanctified namely cleansed from fornication idolatry drunkenness and all other outward sin 1 cor 69 10 11 and yet at the same time in another sense of the word they were unsanctified they were not washed not inwardly cleansed from envy evil surmising partiality  but sure they had not a new heart and an old heart together it is most sure they had for at that very time their hearts were truly yet not entirely renewed their carnal mind was nailed to the cross yet it was not wholly destroyed  but could they be unholy while they were temples of the holy ghost yes that they were temples of the holy ghost is certain 1 cor 619 and it is equally certain they were in some degree carnal that is unholy however there is one scripture more which will put the matter out of question if any man be a believer in christ he is a new creature old things are passed away behold all things are become new 2 cor 517 now certainly a man cannot be a new creature and an old creature at once yes he may he may be partly renewed which was the very case with those atcorinth they were doubtless renewed in the spirit of their mind or they could not have been so much as babes in christ yet they had not the whole mind which was in christ for they envied one another but it is said expressly old things are passed away all things are become new but we must not so interpret the apostles words as to make him contradict himself and if we will make him consistent with himself the plain meaning of the words is this his old judgment concerning justification holiness happiness indeed concerning the things of god in general is now passed away so are his old desires designs affections tempers and conversation all these are undeniably become new greatly changed from what they were and yet though they are new they are not wholly new still he feels to his sorrow and shame remains of the old man too manifest taints of his former tempers and affections though they cannot gain any advantage over him as long as he watches unto prayer this whole argument if he is clean he is clean if he is holy he is holy and twenty more expressions of the same kind may easily be heaped together is really no better than playing upon words it is the fallacy of arguing from a particular to a general of inferring a general conclusion from particular premises propose the sentence entire and it runs thus if he is holy at all he is holy altogether that does not follow every babe in christ is holy and yet not altogether so he is saved from sin yet not entirely it remains though it does not reign if you think it does not remain in babes at least whatever be the case with young men or fathers you certainly have not considered the height and depth and length and breadth of the law of god even the law of love laid down by st paul in the thirteenth of corinthians and that every anomia disconformity to or deviation from this law is sin now is there no disconformity to this in the heart or life of a believer what may be in an adult christian is another question but what a stranger must he be to human nature who can possibly imagine that this is the case with every babe in christ but believers walk after the spirit what follows for some pages is an answer to a paper published in the christian magazine p 577582 i am surprised mrdodd should give such a paper a place in his magazine which is directly contrary to our ninth article  editor rom 81 and the spirit of god dwells in them consequently they are delivered from the guilt the power or in one word the being of sin   these are coupled together as if they were the same thing but they are not the same thing the guilt is one thing the power another and the being yet another that believers are delivered from the guilt and power of sin we allow that they are delivered from the being of it we deny nor does it in any wise follow from these texts a man may have the spirit of god dwelling in him and may walk after the spirit though he still feels the flesh lusting against the spirit 5 but the church is the body of christ col 124 this implies that its members are washed from all filthiness otherwise it will follow that christ and belial are incorporated with each other nay it will not follow from hence those who are the mystical body of christ still feel the flesh lusting against the spirit that christ has any fellowship with the devil or with that sin which he enables them to resist and overcome 6 but are not christians come to the heavenly jerusalem where nothing defiled can enterheb 1222 yes and to an innumerable company of angels and to the spirits of just men made perfect that is earth and heaven all agree all is one great family and they are likewise holy and undefiled while they walk after the spirit although sensible there is another principle in them and that these are contrary to each other 7 but christians are reconciled to god now this could not be if any of the carnal mind remained for this is enmity against god consequently no reconciliation can be effected but by its total destruction we are reconciled to god through the blood of the cross and in that moment the phronema sarkos the corruption of nature which is enmity with god is put under our feet the flesh has no more dominion over us but it still exists and it is still in its nature enmity with god lusting against his spirit but they that are christs have crucified the flesh with its affections and lusts gal 524 they have so yet it remains in them still and often struggles to break from the cross nay but they have put off the old man with his deeds col 39 they have and in the sense above described old things are passed away all things are become new a hundred texts may be cited to the same effect and they will all admit of the same answer  but to say all in one word christ gave himself for the church that it might be holy and without blemish eph 525 27 and so it will be in the end but it never was yet from the beginning to this day but let experience speak all who are justified do at that time find an absolute freedom from all sin that i doubt but if they do do they find it ever after else you gain nothing  if they do not it is their own fault that remains to be proved but in the very nature of things can a man have pride in him and not be proud anger and yet not be angry a man may have pride in him may think of himself in some particulars above what he ought to think and so be proud in that particular and yet not be a proud man in his general character he may have anger in him yea and a strong propensity to furious anger without giving way to it  but can anger and pride be in that heart where only meekness and humility are felt no but some pride and anger may be in that heart where there is much humility and meekness it avails not to say these tempers are there but they do not reign for sin cannot in any kind or degree exist where it does not reign for guilt and power are essential properties of sin therefore where one of them is all must be   strange indeed sin cannot in any kind or degree exist where it does not reign absolutely contrary this to all experience all scripture all common sense resentment of an affront is sin it is anomia disconformity to the law of love this has existed in me a thousand times yet it did not and does not reign  but guilt and power are essential properties of sin therefore where one is all must be no in the instance before us if the resentment i feel is not yielded to even for a moment there is no guilt at all no condemnation from god upon that account and in this case it has no power though it lusteth against the spirit it cannot prevail here therefore as in ten thousand instances there is sin without either guilt or power but the supposing sin in a believer is pregnant with everything frightful and discouraging it implies the contending with a power that has the possession of our strength maintains his usurpation of our hearts and there prosecutes the war in defiance of our redeemer not so the supposing sin is in us does not imply that it has the possession of our strength no more than a man crucified has the possession of those that crucify him as little does it imply that sin maintains its usurpation of our hearts the usurper is dethroned he remains indeed where he once reigned but remains in chains so that he does in some sense prosecute the war yet he grows weaker and weaker while the believer goes on from strength to strength conquering and to conquer i am not satisfied yet he that has sin in him is a slave to sin therefore you suppose a man to be justified while he is a slave to sin now if you allow men may be justified while they have pride anger or unbelief in them nay if you aver these are at least for a time in all that are justified what wonder that we have so many proud angry unbelieving believers i do not suppose any man who is justified is a slave to sin yet i do suppose sin remains at least for a time in all that are justified but if sin remains in a believer he is a sinful man if pride for instance then he is proud if selfwill then he is selfwilled if unbelief then he is an unbeliever consequently no believer at all how then does he differ from unbelievers from unregenerate men this is still mere playing upon words it means no more than if there is sin pride selfwill in him then  there is sin pride selfwill and this nobody can deny in that sense then he is proud or selfwilled but he is not proud or selfwilled in the same sense that unbelievers are that is governed by pride or selfwill herein he differs from unregenerate men they obey sin he does not flesh is in them both but they walk after the flesh he walks after the spirit but how can unbelief be in a believer that word has two meanings it means either no faith or little faith either the absence of faith or the weakness of it in the former sense unbelief is not in a believer in the latter it is in all babes their faith is commonly mixed with doubt or fear that is in the latter sense with unbelief why are ye fearful says our lord o ye of little faith again o thou of little faith wherefore didst thou doubt you see here was unbelief in believers little faith and much unbelief  13 but this doctrine that sin remains in a believer that a man may be in the favour of god while he has sin in his heart certainly tends to encourage men in sin understand the proposition right and no such consequence follows a man may be in gods favour though he feel sin but not if he yields to it having sin does not forfeit the favour of god giving way to sin does though the flesh in you lust against the spirit you may still be a child of god but if you walk after the flesh you are a child of the devil now this doctrine does not encourage to obey sin but to resist it with all our might v 1 the sum of all is this there are in every person even after he is justified two contrary principles nature and grace termed by st paul the flesh and the spirit hence although even babes in christ are sanctified yet it is only in part in a degree according to the measure of their faith they are spiritual yet in a degree they are carnal accordingly believers are continually exhorted to watch against the flesh as well as the world and the devil and to this agrees the constant experience of the children of god while they feel this witness in themselves they feel a will not wholly resigned to the will of god they know they are in him and yet find an heart ready to depart from him a proneness to evil in many instances and a backwardness to that which is good the contrary doctrine is wholly new never heard of in the church of christ from the time of his coming into the world till the time   of count zinzendorf and it is attended with the most fatal consequences it cuts off all watching against our evil nature against the delilah which we are told is gone though she is still lying in our bosom it tears away the shield of weak believers deprives them of their faith and so leaves them exposed to all the assaults of the world the flesh and the devil 2 let us therefore hold fast the sound doctrine once delivered to the saints and delivered down by them with the written word to all succeeding generations that although we are renewed cleansed purified sanctified the moment we truly believe in christ yet we are not then renewed cleansed purified altogether but the flesh the evil nature still remains though subdued and wars against the spirit so much the more let us use all diligence in fighting the good fight of faith so much the more earnestly let us watch and pray against the enemy within the more carefully let us take to ourselves and put on the wholearmor of god that although we wrestle both with flesh and blood and with the principalities and with powers and wicked spirits in high places we may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand   sermon 14 the repentance of believers repent ye and believe the gospel mark 115 it is generally supposed that repentance and faith are only the gate of religion that they are necessary only at the beginning of our christian course when we are setting out in the way to the kingdom and this may seem to be confirmed by the great apostle where exhorting the hebrew christians to go on to perfection he teaches them to leave these first principles of the doctrine of christ not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith towards god which must at least mean that they should comparatively leave these that at first took up all their thoughts in order to press forward toward the prize of the high calling of god in christ jesus and this is undoubtedly true that there is a repentance and a faith which are more especially necessary at the beginning a repentance which is a conviction of our utter sinfulness and guiltiness and helplessness and which precedes our receiving that kingdom of god which our lord observes is within us and a faith whereby we receive that kingdom even righteousness and peace and joy in the holy ghost but notwithstanding this there is also a repentance and a faith taking the words in another sense a sense not quite the same nor yet entirely different which are requisite after we have believed the gospel yea and in every subsequent stage of our christian course or we cannot run the race which is set before us and this repentance and faith are full as necessary in order to our continuance and growth in grace as the former faith and repentance were in order to our entering into the kingdom of god but in what sense are we to repent and believe after we are justified this is an important question and worthy of being considered with the utmost attention i and first in what sense are we to repent repentance frequently means an inward change a change of mind from sin to holiness but we now speak of it in a quite different sense as it is one kind of selfknowledge the knowing ourselves sinners yea guilty helpless sinners even though we know we are children of god indeed when we first know this when we first find the redemption in the blood of jesus when the love of god is first shed abroad in our hearts and his kingdom set up therein it is natural to suppose that we are no longer sinners that all our sins are not only covered but destroyed as we do not then feel any evil in our hearts we readily imagine none is there nay some wellmeaning men have imagined this not only at that time but ever after having persuaded themselves that when they were justified they were entirely sanctified yea they have laid it down as a general rule in spite of scripture reason and experience these sincerely believe and earnestly maintain that all sin is destroyed when we are justified and that there is no sin in the heart of a believer but that it is altogether clean from that moment but though we readily acknowledge he that believeth is born of god and he that is born of god doth not commit sin yet we cannot allow that he does not feel it from within it does not reign but it does remain and a conviction of the sin which remains in our heart is one great branch of the repentance we are now speaking of for it is seldom long before he who imagined all sin was gone feels there is still pride in his heart he is convinced both that in many respects he has thought of himself more highly than he ought to think and that he has taken to himself the praise of something he had received and gloried in it as though he had not received it and yet he knows he is in the favour of god he cannot and ought not to cast away his confidence the spirit still witnesses with his spirit that he is a child of god   nor is it long before he feels selfwill in his heart even a will contrary to the will of god a will every man must inevitably have as long as he has an understanding this is an essential part of human nature indeed of the nature of every intelligent being our blessed lord himself had a will as a man otherwise he had not been a man but his human will was invariably subject to the will of his father at all times and on all occasions even in the deepest affliction he could say not as i will but as thou wilt but this is not the case at all times even with a true believer in christ he frequently finds his will more or less exalting itself against the will of god he wills something because it is pleasing to nature which is not pleasing to god and henills is averse from something because it is painful to nature which is the will of god concerning him indeed suppose he continues in the faith he fights against it with all his might but this very thing implies that it really exists and that he is conscious of it  now selfwill as well as pride is a species of idolatry and both are directly contrary to the love of god the same observation may be made concerning the love of the world but this likewise even true believers are liable to feel in themselves and every one of them does feel it more or less sooner or later in one branch or another it is true when he first passes from death unto life he desires nothing more but god he can truly say all my desire is unto thee and unto the remembrance of thy name whom have i in heaven but thee and there is none upon earth that i desire beside thee but it is not so always in process of time he will feel again though perhaps only for a few moments either the desire of the flesh or the desire of the eye or the pride of life nay if he does not continually watch and pray he may find lust reviving yea and thrusting sore at him that he may fall till he has scarce any strength left in him he may feel the assaults of inordinate affection yea a strong propensity to love the creature more than the creator whether it be a child a parent a husband or wife or the friend that is as his own soul he may feel in a thousand various ways a desire of earthly things or pleasures in the same proportion he will forget god not seeking his happiness in him and consequently being a lover of pleasure more than a lover of god if he does not keep himself every moment he will again feel the desire of the eye the desire of gratifying his imagination with something great or beautiful or uncommon in how many ways does this desire assault the soul perhaps with regard to the poorest trifles such as dress or furniture things never designed to satisfy the appetite of an immortal spirit yet how natural is it for us even after we have tasted of the powers of the world to come to sink again into these foolish low desires of things that perish in the using how hard is it even for those who know in whom they have believed to conquer but one branch of the desire of the eye curiosity constantly to trample it under their feet to desire nothing merely because it is new and how hard is it even for the children of god wholly to conquer the pride of life st john seems to mean by this nearly the same with what the world terms the sense of honour this is no other than a desire of and delight in the honour that cometh of men a desire and love of praise and which is always joined with it a proportionable fear of dispraise nearly allied to this is evil shame the being ashamed of that wherein we ought to glory and this is seldom divided from the fear of man which brings a thousand snares upon the soul now where is he even among those that seem strong in the faith who does not find in himself a degree of all these evil tempers so that even these are but in part crucified to the world for the evil root still remains in their heart and do we not feel other tempers which are as contrary to the love of our neighbour as these are to the love of god the love of our neighbour thinketh no evil do not we find anything of the kind do we never find any jealousies any evilsurmisings any groundless or unreasonable suspicions he that is clear in these respects let him cast the first stone at his neighbour who does not sometimes feel other tempers or inward motions which he knows are contrary to brotherly love if nothing of malice hatred or bitterness is there no touch of envy particularly toward those who enjoy some real or supposed good which we desire but cannot attain do we never find any degree of resentment when we are injured or affronted especially by those whom we peculiarly loved and whom we had most laboured to help or oblige does injustice or ingratitude never excite in us any desire of revenge any desire of returning evil for evil instead of overcoming evil with good this also shows how much is still in our heart which is contrary to the love of our neighbour   covetousness in every kind and degree is certainly as contrary to this as to the love of god whether philargyri the love of money which is too frequently the root of all evil orpleonexia literally a desire of having more or increasing in substance and how few even of the real children of god are entirely free from both indeed one great man martinluther used to say he never had any covetousness in him not only in his converted state but ever since he was born but if so i would not scruple to say he was the only man born of a woman except him that was god as well as man who had not who was born without it nay i believe never was any one born of god that lived any considerable time after who did not feel more or less of it many times especially in the latter sense we may therefore set it down as an undoubted truth that covetousness together with pride and selfwill and anger remain in the hearts even of them that are justified it is their experiencing this which has inclined so many serious persons to understand the latter part of the seventh chapter to the romans not of them that are under the law that are convinced of sin which is undoubtedly the meaning of the apostle but of them that are under grace that are justified freely through the redemption that is in christ and it is most certain they are thus far right  there does still remain even in them that are justified a mind which is in some measure carnal so the apostle tells even the believers atcorinth ye are carnal an heart bent to backsliding still ever ready to depart from the living god a propensity to pride selfwill anger revenge love of the world yea and all evil a root of bitterness which if the restraint were taken off for a moment would instantly spring up yea such a depth of corruption as without clear light from god we cannot possibly conceive and a conviction of all this sin remaining in their hearts is the repentance which belongs to them that are justified but we should likewise be convinced that as sin remains in our hearts so it cleaves to all our words and actions indeed it is to be feared that many of our words are more than mixed with sin that they are sinful altogether for such undoubtedly is all uncharitable conversation all which does not spring from brotherly love all which does not agree with that golden rule what ye would that others should do to you even so do unto them of this kind is all backbiting all talebearing all whispering all evilspeaking that is repeating the faults of absent persons for none would have others repeat his faults when he is absent now how few are there even among believers who are in no degree guilty of this who steadily observe the good old rule of the dead and the absent nothing but good and suppose they do do they likewise abstain from unprofitable conversation yet all this is unquestionably sinful and grieves the holy spirit of god yea and for every idle word that men shall speak they shall give an account in the day of judgement but let it be supposed that they continually watch and pray and so do not enter into this temptation that they constantly set a watch before their mouth and keep the door of their lips suppose they exercise themselves herein that all their conversation may be in grace seasoned with salt and meet to minister grace to the hearers yet do they not daily slide into useless discourse notwithstanding all their caution and even when they endeavour to speak for god are their words pure free from unholy mixtures do they find nothing wrong in their very intention do they speak merely to please god and not partly to please themselves is it wholly to do the will of god and not their own will also or if they begin with a single eye do they go on looking unto jesus and talking with him all the time they are talking with their neighbour when they are reproving sin do they feel no anger or unkind temper to the sinner when they are instructing the ignorant do they not find any pride any selfpreference when they are comforting the afflicted or provoking one another to love and to good works do they never perceive any inward selfcommendation now you have spoken well or any vanity  a desire that others should think so and esteem them on the account in some or all of these respects how much sin cleaves to the best conversation even of believers the conviction of which is another branch of the repentance which belongs to them that are justified and how much sin if their conscience is thoroughly awake may they find cleaving to their actions also nay are there not many of these which though they are such as the world would not condemn yet cannot be commended no nor excused if we judge by the word of god are there not many of their actions which they themselves know are not to the glory of god many wherein they did not even aim at this which were not undertaken with an eye to god and of those that were are there not many wherein their eye is not singly fixed on god  wherein they are doing their own will at least as much as his and seeking to please themselves as much if not more than to please god    and while they are endeavouring to do good to their neighbour do they not feel wrong tempers of various kinds hence their good actions so called are far from being strictly such being polluted with such a mixture of evil such are their works of mercy and is there not the same mixture in their works of piety while they are hearing the word which is able to save their souls do they not frequently find such thoughts as make them afraid lest it should turn to their condemnation rather than their salvation is it not often the same case while they are endeavouring to offer up their prayers to god whether in public or private nay while they are engaged in the most solemn service even while they are at the table of the lord what manner of thoughts arise in them are not their hearts sometimes wandering to the ends of the earth sometimes filled with suchimaginations as make them fear lest all their sacrifice should be an abomination to the lord so that they are now more ashamed of their best duties than they were once of their worst sins again how many sins of omission are they chargeable with we know the words of the apostle to him that knoweth to do good and doeth it not to him it is sin but do they not know a thousand instances wherein they might have done good to enemies to strangers to their brethren either with regard to their bodies or their souls and they did it not how many omissions have they been guilty of in their duty toward god how many opportunities of communicating of hearing his word of public or private prayer have they neglected so great reason had even that holy man archbishop usher after all his labours for god to cry out almost with his dying breath lord forgive me my sins of omission  but besides these outward omissions may they not find in themselves inward defects without number defects of every kind they have not the love the fear the confidence they ought to have toward god they have not the love which is due to their neighbour to every child of man no nor even that which is due to their brethren to every child of god whether those that are at a distance from them or those with whom they are immediately connected they have no holy temper in the degree they ought they are defective in everything  in a deep consciousness of which they are ready to cry out with m de renty i am a ground all overrun with thorns or with job i am vile i abhor myself and repent as in dust and ashes a conviction of their guiltiness is another branch of that repentance which belongs to the children of god but this is cautiously to be understood and in a peculiar sense for it is certain there is no condemnation to them that are in christ jesus that believe in him and in the power of that faith walk not after the flesh but after the spirit yet can they no more bear the strict justice of god now than before they believed this pronounces them to be still worthy of death on all the preceding accounts and it would absolutely condemn them thereto were it not for the atoning blood therefore they are thoroughly convinced that they still deserve punishment although it is hereby turned aside from them but here there are extremes on one hand and on the other and few steer clear of them most men strike on one or the other either thinking themselves condemned when they are not or thinking they deserve to be acquitted nay the truth lies between they still deserve strictly speaking only the damnation of hell but what they deserve does not come upon them because they have an advocate with the father his life and death and intercession still interpose between them and condemnation  a conviction of their utter helplessness is yet another branch of this repentance i mean hereby two things first that they are no more able now of themselves to think one good thought to form one good desire to speak one good word or do one good work than before they were justified that they have still no kind or degree of strength of their own no power either to do good or resist evil no ability to conquer or even withstand the world the devil or their own evil nature they can it is certain do all these things but it is not by their own strength they have power to overcome all these enemies for sin hath no more dominion over them but it is not from nature either in whole or in part it is the mere gift of god nor is it given all at once as if they had a stock laid up for many years but from moment to moment by this helplessness i mean secondly an absolute inability to deliver ourselves from that guiltiness or desert of punishment whereof we are still conscious yea and an inability to remove by all the grace we have to say nothing of our natural powers either the pride selfwill love of the world anger and general proneness to depart from god which we experimentally know to remain in   the heart even of them that are regenerate or the evil which in spite of all our endeavours cleaves to all our words and actions add to this an utter inability wholly to avoid uncharitable and much more unprofitable conversation and an inability to avoid sins of omission or to supply the numberless defects we are convinced of especially the want of love and other right tempers both to god and man  if any man is not satisfied of this if any believes that whoever is justified is able to remove these sins out of his heart and life let him make the experiment let him try whether by the grace he has already received he can expel pride selfwill or inbred sin in general let him try whether he can cleanse his words and actions from all mixture of evil whether he can avoid all uncharitable and unprofitable conversation with all sins of omission and lastly whether he can supply the numberless defects which he still finds in himself let him not be discouraged by one or two experiments but repeat the trial again and again and the longer he tries the more deeply will he be convinced of his utter helplessness in all these respects indeed this is so evident a truth that well nigh all the children of god scattered abroad however they differ in other points yet generally agree in this  that although we may by the spirit mortify the deeds of the body resist and conquer both outward and inward sin although we may weaken our enemies day by day  yet we cannot drive them out by all the grace which is given at justification we cannot extirpate them though we watch and pray ever so much we cannot wholly cleanse either our hearts or hands most sure we cannot till it shall please our lord to speak to our hearts again to speak the second time be clean and then only the leprosy is cleansed then only the evil root the carnal mind is destroyed and inbred sin subsists no more but if there be no such second change if there be no instantaneous deliverance after justification if there be none but a gradual work of god that there is a gradual work none denies then we must be content as well as we can to remain full of sin till death and if so we must remain guilty till death continually deserving punishment for it is impossible the guilt or desert of punishment should be removed from us as long as all this sin remains in our heart and cleaves to our words and actions nay in rigorous justice all we think and speak and act continually increases it ii 1 in this sense we are to repent after we are justified and till we do so we can go no farther for till we are sensible of our disease it admits of no cure but supposing we do thus repent then are we called to believe the gospel 2 and this also is to be understood in a peculiar sense different from that wherein we believed in order to justification believe the glad tidings of great salvation which god hath prepared for all people believe that he who is the brightness of his fathers glory the express image of his person is able to save unto the uttermost all that come unto god through him he is able to save you from all the sin that still remains in your heart he is able to save you from all the sin that cleaves to all your words and actions he is able to save you from sins of omission and to supply whatever is wanting in you it is true this is impossible with man but with godman all things are possible for what can be too hard for him who hath all power in heaven and in earth indeed his bare power to do this is not a sufficient foundation for our faith that he will do it that he will thus exert his power unless he hath promised it but this he has done he has promised it over and over in the strongest terms he has given us these exceeding great and precious promises both in the old and the new testament so we read in the law in the most ancient part of the oracles of god the lord thy god will circumcise thy heart and the heart of thy seed to love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul deut 306 so in the psalms he shall redeem israel the israel of god from all his sins so in the prophet then will i sprinkle clean water upon you and ye shall be clean from all your filthiness and from all your idols will i cleanse you and i will put my spirit within you and ye shall keep my judgements and do them i will also save you from all yourncleannesses ezek 3625 c so likewise in the new testament blessed be the lord god of israel for he hath visited and redeemed his people and hath raised up an horn of salvation for us  to perform the oath which he sware to our father abraham that he would grant unto us that we being delivered out of the hands of our enemies should serve him without fear in holiness and righteousness before him all the days of our life luke 168 c   you have therefore good reason to believe he is not only able but willing to do this to cleanse you from all your filthiness of flesh and spirit to save you from all youruncleannesses this is the thing which you now long for this is the faith which you now particularly need namely that the great physician the lover of my soul is willing to make me clean but is he willing to do this tomorrow or today let him answer for himself today if ye will hear my voice harden not your hearts if you put it off till tomorrow you harden your hearts you refuse to hear his voice believe therefore that he is willing to save you today he is willing to save you now behold now is the accepted time he now saith be thou clean only believe and you also will immediately find all things are possible to him that believeth continue to believe in him that loved thee and gave himself for thee that bore all thy sins in his own body on the tree and hesaveth thee from all condemnation by his blood continually applied thus it is that we continue in a justified state and when we go from faith to faith when we have faith to be cleansed from indwelling sin to be saved from all ouruncleannesses we are likewise saved from all that guilt that desert of punishment which we felt before so that then we may say not only every moment lord i want the merit of thy death but likewise in the full assurance of faith every moment lord i have the merit of thy death for by that faith in his life death and intercession for us renewed from moment to moment we are every whit clean and there is not only now no condemnation for us but no such desert of punishment as was before the lord cleansing both our hearts and lives by the same faith we feel the power of christ every moment resting upon us whereby alone we are what we are whereby we are enabled to continue in spiritual life and without which notwithstanding all our present holiness we should be devils the next moment but as long as we retain our faith in him we draw water out of the wells of salvation leaning on our beloved even christ in us the hope of glory whodwelleth in our hearts by faith who likewise is ever interceding for us at the right hand of god we receive help from him to think and speak and act what is acceptable in his sight thus does he prevent them that believe in all their doings and further them with his continual help so that all their designs conversations and actions are begun continued and ended in him thus doth he cleanse the thoughts of their hearts by the inspiration of his holy spirit that they may perfectly love him and worthily magnify his holy name thus it is that in the children of god repentance and faith exactly answer each other by repentance we feel the sin remaining in our hearts and cleaving to our words and actions by faith we receive the power of god in christ purifying our hearts and cleansing our hands by repentance we are still sensible that we deserve punishment for all our tempers and words and actions by faith we are conscious that our advocate with the father is continually pleading for us and thereby continually turning aside all condemnation and punishment from us by repentance we have an abiding conviction that there is no help in us by faith we receive not only mercy but grace to help in every time of need repentance disclaims the very possibility of any other help faith accepts all the help we stand in need of from him that hath all power in heaven and earth repentance says without him i can do nothing faith says i can do all things through christ strengthening me through him i can not only overcome but expel all the enemies of my soul through him i can love the lord my god with all my heart mind soul and strength yea and walk in holiness and righteousness before him all the days of my life    iii 1 from what has been said we may easily learn the mischievousness of that opinion  that we are wholly sanctified when we are justified that our hearts are then cleansed from all sin it is true we are then delivered as was observed before from the dominion of outward sin and at the same   time the power of inward sin is so broken that we need no longer follow or be led by it but it is by no means true that inward sin is then totally destroyed that the root of pride selfwill anger love of the world is then taken out of the heart or that the carnal mind and the heart bent to backsliding are entirely extirpated and to suppose the contrary is not as some may think an innocent harmless mistake no it does immense harm it entirely blocks up the way to any farther change for it is manifest they that are whole not need a physician but they that are sick if therefore we think we are quite made whole already there is no room to seek any further healing on this supposition it is absurd to expect a farther deliverance from sin whether gradual or instantaneous 2 on the contrary a deep conviction that we are not yet whole that our hearts are not fully purified that there is yet in us a carnal mind which is still in its nature enmity against god that a whole body of sin remains in our heart weakened indeed but not destroyed shows beyond all possibility of doubt the absolute necessity of a farther change we allow that at the very moment of justification we are born again in that instant we experience that inward change from darkness into marvellous light from the image of the brute and the devil into the image of god from the earthly sensual devilish mind to the mind which was in christ jesus but are we then entirely changed are we wholly transformed into the image of him that created us far from it we still retain a depth of sin and it is the consciousness of this which constrains us to groan for a full deliverance to him that is mighty to save hence it is that those believers who are not convinced of the deep corruption of their hearts or but slightly and as it were notionally convinced have little concern about entire sanctification they may possibly hold the opinion that such a thing is to be either at death or some time they know not when before it but they have no great uneasiness for the want of it and no great hunger or thirst after it they cannot until they know themselves better until they repent in the sense above described until god unveils the inbred monsters face and shows them the real state of their souls then only when they feel the burden will they groan for deliverance from it then and not till then will they cry out in the agony of their soul  break off the yoke of inbred sin and fully set my spirit free i cannot rest till pure within till i am wholly lost in thee 3 we may learn from hence secondly that a deep conviction of our demerit after we are accepted which in one sense may be termed guilt is absolutely necessary in order to our seeing the true value of the atoning blood in order to our feeling that we need this as much after we are justified as ever we did before without this conviction we cannot but account the blood of the covenant as a common thing something of which we have not now any great need seeing all our past sins are blotted out yea but if both our hearts and lives are thus unclean there is a kind of guilt which we are contracting every moment and which of consequence would every moment expose us to fresh condemnation but that he ever lives above for us to intercede  his allatoning love his precious blood to plead it is this repentance and the faith intimately connected with it which are expressed in those strong lines  i sin in every breath i draw nor do thy will nor keep thy law   on earth as angels do above but still the fountain open stands washes my feet my heart my hands till i am perfected in love 4 we may observe thirdly a deep conviction of our utter helplessness of our total inability to retain anything we have received much more to deliver ourselves from the world of iniquity remaining both in our hearts and lives teaches us truly to live upon christ by faith not only as our priest but as our king hereby we are brought to magnify him indeed to give him all the glory of his grace to make him a whole christ an entire saviour and truly to set the crown upon his head these excellent words as they have frequently been used have little or no meaning but they are fulfilled in a strong and deep sense when we thus as it were go out of ourselves in order to be swallowed up in him when we sink into nothing that he may be all in all then his almighty grace having abolished every high thing which exalted itself against him every temper and thought and word and work is brought to the obedience of christ londonderry april 24 1767   sermon 15 text of the 1872 edition sermon 48 in the sugdens edition the great assize ie the last judgment  gl preached at the assizes held before thehonorable sir edward clive knight one of the judges of his majestys court of common pleas in st pauls church bedford on friday march 10 1758 published at the request of williamcole esq high sheriff of the county and others we shall all stand before the judgementseat of christrom 1410 how many circumstances concur to raise the awfulness of the present solemnity  the general concourse of people of every age sex rank and condition of life willingly or unwillingly gathered together not only from the neighboring but from distant parts criminals speedily to be brought forth and having no way to escape officers waiting in their various posts to execute the orders which shall be given and the representative of our gracious sovereign whom we so highly reverence and honor the occasion likewise of this assembly adds not a little to the solemnity of it to hear and determine causes of every kind some of which are of the most important nature on which depends no less than life or death death that uncovers the face of eternity it was doubtless in order to increase the serious sense of these things and not in the minds of the vulgar only that the wisdom of our forefathers did not disdain to appoint even several minute circumstances of this solemnity for these also by means of the eye or ear may more deeply affect the heart and when viewed in this light trumpets staves apparel are no longer trifling or insignificant but subservient in their kind and degree to the most valuable ends of society  but as awful as this solemnity is one far more awful is at hand for yet a little while and we shall all stand before the judgementseat of christ for as i live saith the lord every knee shall bow to me and every tongue shall confess to god and in that day every one of us shall give account of himself to god had all men a deep sense of this how effectually would it secure the interests of society for what more forcible motive can be conceived to the practice of genuine morality to a steady pursuit of solid virtue an uniform walking in justice mercy and truth what could strengthen our hands in all that is good and deter us from all evil like a strong conviction of this the judgestandeth at the door and we are shortly to stand before him it may not therefore be improper or unsuitable to the design of the present assembly to consider  i the chief circumstances which will precede our standing before the judgementseat of christ ii the judgement itself and iii a few of the circumstances which will follow it i 1 let us in the first place consider the chief circumstances which will precede our standing before the judgementseat of christ and first god will show signs in the earth beneath acts 219 particularly he will arise to shake terribly the earth  the earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard and shall be removed like a cottage isa 2420 there shall be earthquakes kata topous not in divers only but in all places not in one only or a few but in every part of the habitable worldluke 212 even such as were not since men were upon the earth so mighty earthquakes and so great in one of these every island shall flee away and the mountains will not be found rev 1620 meantime all the waters of   the terraqueous globe will feel the violence of thoseconcussions the sea and waves roaring luke 2125 with such an agitation as had never been known before since the hour that the fountains of the great deep were broken up to destroy the earth which then stood out of the water and in the water the air will be all storm and tempest full of darkvapors and pillars of smoke joel 230 resounding with thunder from pole to pole and torn with ten thousandlightnings but the commotion will not stop in the region of the air the powers of heaven also shall be shaken there shall be signs in the sun and in the moon and in the stars luke 2125 26 those fixed as well as those that move round them the sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before the great and terrible day of the lord come joel 231 the stars shall withdraw their shining joel 315 yea and fall from heaven rev 613 being thrown out of their orbits and then shall be heard the universal shout from all the companies of heaven followed by the voice of the archangel proclaiming the approach of the son of god and man and the trumpet of god sounding an alarm to all that sleep in the dust of the earth 1 thess 416 in consequence of this all the graves shall open and the bodies of men arise the sea also shall give up the dead which are therein rev 2013 and every one shall rise with his own body his own in substance although so changed in its properties as we cannot now conceive for this corruptible will then put onincorruption and this mortal put on immortality 1 cor 1553 yea death andhades the invisible world shall deliver up the dead that are in them rev 2013 so that all who ever lived and died since god created man shall be raised incorruptible and immortal 2 at the same time the son of man shall send forth his angels over all the earth and they shall gather his elect from the four winds from one end of heaven to the other matt 2431 and the lord himself shall come with clouds in his own glory and the glory of his father with ten thousand of his saints even myriads of angels and shall sit upon the throne of his glory and before him shall be gathered all nations and he shall separate them one from another and shall set the sheep the good on his right hand and the goats the wicked upon the left matt 2531 etc concerning this general assembly it is that the beloved disciple speaks thus i saw the dead all that had been dead small and great stand before god and the books were opened a figurative expression plainly referring to the manner of proceeding among men and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books according to their works rev 2012 ii these are the chief circumstances which are recorded in the oracles of god as preceding the general judgement we are secondly to consider the judgement itself so far as it hath pleased god to reveal it  the person by whom god will judge the world is his onlybegotten son whose goings forth are from everlasting who is god over all blessed for ever unto him being theoutbeaming of his fathers glory the express image of his person heb 13 the father hath committed all judgement because he is the son of man john 522 27 because though he was in the form of god and thought it not robbery to be equal with god yet he emptied himself taking upon him the form of a servant being made in the likeness of men phil 26 7 yea because being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself yet farther becoming obedient unto death even the death of the cross wherefore god hath highly exalted him even in his human nature and ordained him as man to try the children of men to be the judge both of the quick and the dead both of those who shall be found alive at his coming and of those who were before gathered to their fathers the time termed by the prophet the great and the terrible day is usually in scripture styled the day of the lord the space from the creation of man upon the earth to the end of all things is the day of the sons of men the time that is now passing over us is properly our day when this is ended the day of the lord will begin but who can say how long it will continue with the lord one day is as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day 2 pet 38 and from this very expression some of the ancient fathers drew that inference that what is commonly called the day of judgement would be indeed a thousand years and it seems they did not go beyond the truth nay probably they did not come up to it for if we consider the number of persons who are to be judged and of actions which are to be inquired into it does not appear that a thousand years will suffice for the transactions of that day so that it may not improbably comprise several thousand years but god shall reveal this also in its season   3 with regard to the place where mankind will be judged we have no explicit account in scripture an eminent writer but not he alone many have been of the same opinion supposes it will be on earth where the works were done according to which they shall be judged and that god will in order thereto employ the angels of his strength  to smooth and lengthen out the boundless space and spread an area for all human race but perhaps it is more agreeable to our lords own account of his coming in the clouds to suppose it will be above the earth if not twice a planetary height and this supposition is not a littlefavored by what st paul writes to the thessalonians the dead in christ shall rise first then we who remain alive shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air 1thess 416 17 so that it seems most probable the great white throne will be high exalted above the earth 4  the persons to be judged who can count any more than the drops of rain or the sands of the sea i beheld saith st john a great multitude which no man can number clothed with white robes and palms in their hands how immense then must be the total multitude of all nations andkindreds and people and tongues of all that have sprung from the loins of adam since the world began till time shall be no more if we admit the common supposition which seems no ways absurd that the earth bears at any one time no less than four hundred millions of living souls men women and children what a congregation must all those generations make who have succeeded each other for seven thousand years  great xerxes world in arms proud cannaes host they all are here and here they all are lost their numbers swell to be discernd in vain lost as a drop in the unbounded main every man every woman every infant of days that ever breathed the vital air will then hear the voice of the son of god and start into life and appear before him and this seems to be the natural import of that expression the dead small and great all universally all without exception all of every age sex or degree all that ever lived and died or underwent such a change as will be equivalent with death for long before that day the phantom of human greatness disappears and sinks into nothing even in the moment of death that vanishes away who is rich or great in the grave  5 and every man shall there give an account of his own works yea a full and true account of all that he ever did while in the body whether it was good or evil o what a scene will then be disclosed in the sight of angels and men  while not the fabledrhadamanthus but the lord god almighty who knoweth all things in heaven and in earth  castigatque auditque dolos subigitque fateri quae quis apud superos furto laetatus inani distulit in seram commissa piacula mortem oer these drear realms stern rhadamanthus reigns detects each artful villain and constrains to own the crimes long veild from human sight in vain now all stand forth in hated light   nor will all the actions alone of every child of man be then brought to open view but all their words seeing every idle word which men shall speak they shall give account thereof in the day of judgement matt 1236 37 so that by thy words as well as works thou shalt be justified and by thy words thou shalt be condemned will not god then bring to light every circumstance also that accompanied every word or action and if not altered the nature yet lessened or increased the goodness or badness of them and how easy is this to him who is about our bed and about our path and spieth out all our ways we know the darkness is no darkness to him but the nightshineth as the day yea he will bring to light not the hidden works of darkness only but the very thoughts and intents of the heart and what marvel for he searcheth the reins and understandeth all our thoughts all things are naked and open to the eyes of him with whom we have to do hell and destruction are before him without a covering how much more the hearts of the children of men and in that day shall be discovered every inward working of every human soul every appetite passion inclination affection with the various combinations of them with every temper and disposition that constitute the whole complex character of each individual so shall it be clearly and infallibly seen who was righteous and who unrighteous and in what degree every action or person or character was either good or evil then the king will say to them upon his right hand come ye blessed of my father for i was hungry and ye gave me meat thirsty and ye gave me drink i was a stranger and ye took me in naked and ye clothed me in like manner all the good they did upon earth will be recited before men and angels whatsoever they had done either in word or deed in the name or for the sake of the lord jesus all their good desires intentions thoughts all their holy dispositions will also be then remembered and it will appear that though they were unknown or forgotten among men yet god noted them in his book all their sufferings likewise for the name of jesus and for the testimony of a good conscience will be displayed unto their praise from the righteous judge theirhonor before saints and angels and the increase of that far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory but will their evil deeds too since if we take in his whole life there is not a man on earth who liveth and sinneth not will these be remembered in that day and mentioned in the great congregation  many believe they will not and ask would not this imply that their sufferings were not at an end even when life ended  seeing they would still have sorrow and shame and confusion of face to endure they ask farther how can this be reconciled with gods declaration by the prophet  if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he hath committed and keep all my statutes and do that which is lawful and right all his transgressions that he hath committed they shall not be once mentioned unto him ezek 1821 22 how is it consistent with the promise which god has made to all who accept of the gospel covenant i will forgive their iniquities and remember their sin no more jer 3134 or as the apostle expresses it i will be merciful to their unrighteousness and their sins and iniquities will i remember no more heb 812 it may be answered it is apparently and absolutely necessary for the full display of the glory of god for the clear and perfect manifestation of his wisdom justice power and mercy toward the heirs of salvation that all the circumstances of their life should be placed in open view together with all their tempers and all the desires thoughts and intents of their hearts otherwise how would it appear out of what a depth of sin and misery the grace of god had delivered them and indeed if the whole lives of all the children of men were not manifestly discovered the whole amazing contexture of divine providence could not be manifested nor should we yet be able in a thousand instances to justify the ways of god to man unless our lords words were fulfilled in their utmost sense without any restriction or limitation there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed or hid that shall not be known matt 10 26 abundance of gods dispensations under the sun would still appear without their reasons and then only when god hath brought to light all the hidden things of darkness whosoever were the actors therein will it be seen that wise and good were all his ways that he saw through the thick cloud and governed all things by the wise counsel of his own will that nothing was left to chance or the caprice of men but god disposed all strongly and sweetly and wrought all into one connected chain of justice mercy and truth   and in the discovery of the divineperfections the righteous will rejoice with joy unspeakable far from feeling any painful sorrow or shame for any of those past transgressions which were long since blotted out as a cloud washed away by the blood of the lamb it will be abundantly sufficient for them that all the transgressions which they had committed shall not be once mentioned unto them to their disadvantaged that their sins and transgressions and iniquities shall be remembered no more to their condemnation this is the plain meaning of the promise and this all the children of god shall find true to their everlasting comfort after the righteous are judged the king will turn to them upon his left hand and they shall also be judged every man according to his works but not only their outward works will be brought into the account but all the evil words which they have ever spoken yea all the evil desires affections tempers which have or have had a place in their souls and all the evil thoughts or designs which were ever cherished in their hearts the joyful sentence of acquittal will then be pronounced upon those upon the right hand the dreadful sentence of condemnation upon those on the left both of which must remain fixed and unmovable as the throne of god iii 1 we may in the third place consider a few of the circumstances which will follow the general judgement and the first is the execution of the sentence pronounced on the evil and on the good these shall go away into eternal punishment and the righteous into life eternal it should be observed it is the very same word which is used both in the former and the latter clause it follows that either the punishment lasts for ever or the reward too will come to an end  no never unless god could come to an end or his mercy and truth could fail then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their father and shall drink of those rivers of pleasure which are at gods right hand for evermore but here all description falls short all human language fails only one who is caught up into the third heaven can have a just conception of it but even such a one cannot express what he hath seen these things it is not possible for man to utter the wicked meantime shall be turned into hell even all the people that forget god they will be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the lord and from the glory of his power they will be cast into the lake of fire burning with brimstone originally prepared for the devil and his angels where they will gnaw their tongues for anguish and pain they will curse god and look upward there the dogs of hell  pride malice revenge rage horror despair  continually devour them there they have no rest day or night but the smoke of their tormentascendeth for ever and ever for their worm dieth not and the fire is not quenched then the heavens will be shrivelled up as a parchment scroll and pass away with a great noise they will flee from the face of him thatsitteth on the throne and there will be found no place for them rev 2011 the very manner of their passing away is disclosed to us by the apostle peter in the day of god the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved 2 pet 312 the whole beautiful fabric will be overthrown by that raging element theconnexion of all its parts destroyed and every atom torn asunder from the others by the same the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up verse 10 the enormous works of nature the everlasting hills mountains that have defied the rage of time and stood unmoved so many thousand years will sink down in fiery ruin how much less will the works of art though of the most durable kind the utmost efforts of human industry  tombs pillars triumphal arches castles pyramids  be able to withstand the flaming conqueror all all will die perish vanish away like a dream when oneawaketh it has indeed been imagined by some great and good men that as it requires that same almighty power to annihilate things as to create to speak into nothing or out of nothing so no part of no atom in the universe will be totally or finally destroyed rather they suppose that as the last operation of fire which we have yet been able to observe is to reduce into glass what by a smaller force it had reduced to ashes so in the day god hath ordained the whole earth if not the material heavens also will undergo this change after which the fire can have no farther power over them and they believe this is intimated by that expression in the revelation made to st john before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal rev 46 we cannot now either affirm or deny this but we shall know hereafter   4 if it be inquired by the scoffers the minute philosophers how can these things be whence should come such an immense quantity of fire as would consume the heavens and the whole terraqueous globe we would beg leave first to remind them that this difficulty is not peculiar to the christian system the same opinion almost universally obtained among the unbigoted heathens so one of these celebrated freethinkers speaks according to the generally received sentiment  esse quoque in fatis reminiscitur affore tempus quo mare quo tellus correptaque regia coeli ardeat et mundi moles operosa laboret the following is drydens translation of this quotation fromovid  remembring in the fates a time when fire should to the battlements of heaven aspire and all the blazing world above should burn and all the inferior globe to cinders turn  edit but secondly it is easy to answer even from our slight and superficial acquaintance with natural things that there are abundant magazines of fire ready prepared and treasured up against the day of the lord how soon may a comet commissioned by him travel down from the most distant parts of the universe and were it to fix upon the earth in its return from the sun when it is some thousand times hotter than a redhot cannon ball who does not see what must be the immediate consequence but not to ascend so high as the ethereal heavens might not the samelightnings which give shine to the world if commanded by the lord of nature give ruin and utter destruction or to go no farther than the globe itself who knows what huge reservoirs of liquid fire are from age to age contained in the bowels of the earth  aetna hecla vesuvius and all the other volcanoes that belch out flames and coals of fire what are they but so many proofs and mouths of those fiery furnaces and at the same time so many evidences that god hath in readiness wherewith to fulfil his word yea were we to observe no more than the surface of the earth and the things that surround us on every side it is most certain as a thousand experiments prove beyond all possibility of denial that we ourselves our whole bodies are full of fire as well as everything round about us is it not easy to make this ethereal fire visible even to the naked eye and to produce thereby the very same effects on combustible matter which are produced by culinary fire  needs there then any more than for god to unloose that secret chain whereby this irresistible agent is now bound down and lies quiescent in every particle of matter and how soon would it tear the universal frame in pieces and involve all in one common ruin  5 there is one circumstance more which will follow the judgement that deserves our serious consideration we look says the apostle according to his promise for new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness 2 pet 313 the promise stands in the prophecy ofisaiah behold i create new heavens and a new earth and the former shall not be remembered isa 6517 so great shall the glory of the latter be these st john did behold in the visions of god i saw saith he a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away rev 211 and only righteousness dwelt therein accordingly he adds and i heard a great voice from the third heaven saying behold the tabernacle of god is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and god himself shall be with them and be their god 213 of necessity therefore they will all be happy god shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain 214 there shall be no more curse but they shall see his face 2134  shall have the nearest access to and thence the highest resemblance of him this is the strongest expression in the language of scripture to denote the most perfect happiness and his name shall be on their foreheads they shall be openly acknowledged as gods own property and his glorious nature shall most visibly shine forth   in them and there shall be no night there and they need no candle neither light of the sun for the lord god giveth them light and they shall reign for ever and ever iv it remains only to apply the preceding considerations to all who are here before god and are we not directly led so to do by the present solemnity which so naturally points us to that day when the lord will judge the world in righteousness this therefore by reminding us of that more awful season may furnish many lessons of instruction a few of these i may be permitted just to touch on may god write them on all our hearts and first how beautiful are the feet of those who are sent by the wise and gracious providence of god to execute justice on earth to defend the injured and punish the wrongdoer are they not the ministers of god to us for good the grand supporters of the public tranquillity the patrons of innocence and virtue the great security of all our temporal blessings and does not every one of these represent not only an earthly prince but the judge of the earth him whose name is written upon his thigh king of kings and lord of lords o that all these sons of the right hand of the most high may be as holy as he is holy wise with the wisdom thatsitteth by his throne like him who is the eternal wisdom of the father no respecters of persons as he is none but rendering to every man according to his works like him inflexibly inexorably just though pitiful and of tender mercy so shall they be terrible indeed to them that do evil as not bearing the sword in vain so shall the laws of our land have their full use and due honor and the throne of our king be still established in righteousness ye truly honorable men whom god and the king have commissioned in a lower degree to administer justice may not ye be compared to those ministering spirits who will attend the judge coming in the clouds may you like them burn with love to god and man may you love righteousness and hate iniquity may ye all minister in your several spheres such onor hath god given you also to them that shall be heirs of salvation and to the glory of your great sovereign may ye remain the establishers of peace the blessing and ornaments of your country the protectors of a guilty land the guardian angels of all that are round about you you whose office it is to execute what is given you in charge by him before whom you stand how nearly are you concerned to resemble those that stand before the face of the son of man those servants of his that do his pleasure and hearken to the voice of his words does it not highly import you to be as uncorrupt as them to approve yourselves the servants of god to do justly and love mercy to do to all as ye would they should do to you so shall that great judge under whose eye you continually stand say to you also well done good and faithful servants enter ye into the joy of your lord  suffer me to add a few words to all of you who are at this day present before the lord should not you bear it in your minds all the day long that a more awful day is coming a large assembly this but what is it to that which every eye will then behold the general assembly of all the children of men that ever lived on the face of the whole earth a few will stand at the judgementseat this day to be judged touching what shall be laid to their charge and they are now reserved in prison perhaps in chains till they are brought forth to be tried and sentenced but we shall all i that speak and you that hear stand at the judgementseat of christ and we are now reserved on this earth which is not our home in this prison of flesh and blood perhaps many of us in chains of darkness too till we are ordered to be brought forth here a man is questioned concerning one or two facts which he is supposed to have committed there we are to give an account of all our works from the cradle to the grave of all our words of all our desires and tempers all the thoughts and intents of our hearts of all the use we have made of our various talents whether of mind body or fortune till god said give an account of thy stewardship for thou mayest be no longer steward in this court it is possible some who are guilty may escape for want of evidence but there is no want of evidence in that court all men with whom you had the most secret intercourse who were privy to all your designs and actions are ready before your face so are all the spirits of darkness who inspired evil designs and assisted in the execution of them so are all the angels of god those eyes of the lord that run to and fro over all the earth who watched over your soul and labored for your good so far as you would permit so is your own conscience a thousand witnesses in one now no more capable of being either blinded or silenced but constrained to know and to speak the naked truth touching all your thoughts and words   and actions and is conscience as a thousand witnesses  yea but god is as a thousand consciences o who can stand before the face of the great god even oursavior jesus christ see see he cometh he maketh the clouds his chariots herideth upon the wings of the wind a devouring fire goeth before him and after him a flame burneth see he sitteth upon his throne clothed with light as with a garment arrayed with majesty andhonor behold his eyes are as a flame of fire his voice as the sound of many waters how will ye escape will ye call to the mountains to fall on you the rocks to cover you alas the mountains themselves the rocks the earth the heavens are just ready to flee away can ye prevent the sentence wherewith with all the substance of thy house with thousands of gold and silver blind wretch thou camest naked from thy mothers womb and more naked into eternity hear the lord the judge come ye blessed of my father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world joyful sound how widely different from that voice which echoes through the expanse of heaven depart ye cursed into everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels and who is he that can prevent or retard the full execution of either sentence vain hope lo hell is moved from beneath to receive those who are ripe for destruction and the everlasting doors lift up their heads that the heirs of glory may come in 5 what manner of persons then ought we to be in all holy conversation and godliness we know it cannot be long before the lord will descend with the voice of the archangel and the trumpet of god when every one of us shall appear before him and give account of his own works wherefore beloved seeing ye look for these things seeing ye know he will come and will not tarry be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace without spot and blameless why should ye not why should one of you be found on the left hand at his appearing hewilleth not that any should perish but that all should come to repentance by repentance to faith in a bleeding lord by faith to spotless love to the full image of god renewed in the heart and producing all holiness of conversation can you doubt of this when you remember the judge of all is likewise thesavior of all hath he not bought you with his own blood that ye might not perish but have everlasting life o make proof of his mercy rather than his justice of his love rather than the thunder of his power he is not far from every one of us and he is now come not to condemn but to save the world hestandeth in the midst sinner doth he not now even now knock at the door of thy heart o that thou mayest know at least in this thy day the things that belong unto thy peace o that ye may now give yourselves to him who gave himself for you in humble faith in holy active patient love so shall ye rejoice with exceeding joy in his day when he cometh in the clouds of heavensugdens introduction this sermon was added in the 1771 edition partly because of the unique occasion of its delivery partly because there was no sermon in the original fortyfour on this subjectwesley says of it in his journal for september 1 1778 i cannot write a better sermon on the great assize than i did twenty years ago it was customary for the judges of assize to attend a service in the parish church of the town in which they were sitting in all the splendor of their scarlet and ermine with their trumpeters javelinmen and other officers of the court in attendance and it was one of the duties of the high sheriff of the county to make arrangements for the preaching of the sermon mr williamcole who was high sheriff of bedfordshire at this time was a friend ofwesley and was his host in november 1759 he lived at sundon a village a little to the east of the main road fromluton to bedford about five miles north of luton he built the first methodist preachinghouse inluton probably he made the arrangements for the assize sermon when wesley was at bedford in november 1757 and on monday february 27 wesley records having a sermon to write against the assizes at bedford i retired for a few days to lewisham  doubtless to the house of mr ebenezerblackwell he left london on monday march 6 at seven in the morning and reached mrcoles house at sundon by three in the afternoon on the thursday he rode to bedford expecting to have to preach that day but for some reason probably because the cases at the previous assize town had taken more time than was anticipated the service was postponed to the following day the service was held in the forenoon at st pauls church one of the chief architectural ornaments of the town it stands on the north side of the river ouse and has a fine tower and octagonal spire the old stone pulpit from whichwesley preached is still preserved in the south aisle and a photograph of it and the church may be seen in the standard edition of the journal vol 4 p 403 the journal records the congregation at st pauls was very large and very attentive the judge immediately after sermon sent me an invitation to dine with   him but having no time i was obliged to send my excuse and set out between one and two he had to reach epworth for the sunday and got to stilton about thirty miles by seven next morning he started between four and five and through frost and flood covered the ninety miles toepworth by ten that night he says i was little more tired than when i rose in the morning  tough wiry little man that he was  the judge on this occasion was sir edwardclive who had been made a judge of the common pleas and knighted in 1753 he was just a year younger than johnwesley and died in 1771 a caricature of him may be found in hogarths plate the bench published in this very year 1758 he is sitting between the lord chief justicewilles and mr justice bathurst who has fallen asleep he is represented with a small head almost lost in his fullbottomed wig a long thin nose and a nutcracker chin the sermon was published separately bytrye in the same year at the request of the high sheriff and others and went through some ten editions inwesleys lifetime the rev richard green calls it a model sermon and says it is wellformed plain practical earnest the statements are all supported by apt scripture and the truth faithfully applied to the conscience the title the great assize was a familiar name for the last judgement it is found as early as 1340 inhampoles prick of conscience 5514 and several other instances are given in the oxford dictionarys v assize the preliminary note preached at the assizes etc in the modern editions is from the titlepage of the second edition also published in london bytrye it appears in an abbreviated form in the 1771 edition without the last clause published at the request etc two points in the sermon call for criticism in view of recent investigations into the eschatological teaching of the new testament first wesley identifies without discussion the day of jehovah of the old testament prophets and the jewish apocalyptic writers with the day of our lords second coming the general resurrection and the last judgement of the new testament documents and he uses indiscriminately passages from all these sources to give detail and picturesqueness to his picture moreover he adopts the most literal interpretation of them all the only point at which hebalks being the length of the day of judgement which he thinks may not improbably comprise several thousand years and the opening of the books which he says is a figurative expression it can hardly be doubted that our lords teaching was largely influenced by the old testament and apocalyptic conception especially in his predictions about the destruction of jerusalem and the jewish polity but he added to it the idea of an individual as well as a national judgement and extended its scope to the whole world  in the second place wesley adopts the view that the last judgement will take place at some definite time in the future history of the world when the lives of all men will be reviewed and sentence pronounced upon them this is certainly the obvious meaning of the teaching of the books of the new testament which were written before the destruction of jerusalem by the romans but when that tremendous catastrophe had taken place and it became clear that the general judgement and the end of the age had not come we find in the writings of st john a new strain of teaching implying that the judgement is really continuous and is now going on thus he that believeth on him is not judged he that believeth not hath been judged already and this is the judgement that the light is come into the world and men loved the darkness rather than the light for their works were evil john 318 again verily verily i say unto you he thatheareth my word and believeth him that sent me hath eternal life and cometh not into judgement the hourcometh and now is when the dead shall hear the voice of the son of god and they that hear shall live john 524 again for judgement came i into this world john 939 again now is the judgement of this world john 1231 at the same time st john also speaks of a future general resurrection of the last day and the day of judgement it seems clear 1 that our lord spoke in terms of the current national belief of his time which was derived from the old testament prophets and theapocalypses of the persian and greek periods the time between the books 2 that he used the pictorial rather than the abstract method of conveying the truth to his hearers we may thus safely say that the essential elements of his teaching are 1 that there will be a universal judgement of all men 2 that he himself will be the judge 3 that the standard of judgement will be his own life and teaching as far as those who have had the opportunity of knowing it are concerned 4 that for the heathen the standard will be their own conscience 5 that the issues of the judgement are decided in this life and 6 that the decision will be final but as to the extent to which his representations of the last judgement are to be taken as expressing literal physical fact we shall be wisest if we confess our ignorance and our   inability to reach any dogmatic conclusion as to the text the better attested reading is we shall all stand before the judgement seat of god indeed this text is used by some of the fathers to prove the divinity of christ because it is plain from many passages that he will be the judge and the judge is here called god sugdens footnotes our gracious sovereign is george iiwesley was always intensely loyal in 1744 he wrote an address from his societies to the king in which he says we are ready to obey your majesty to the uttermost in all things which we conceive to be agreeable to the word of god and we earnestly exhort all with whom we converse as they fear god tohonor the king the address was not sent mainly because it might have been taken to imply that the methodists were a body distinct from the national church in 1745 the year of the young pretenderss invasion of england he wrote to the mayor of newcastle all i can do for his majesty whom i honor and love  i think not less than i did my own father  is this i cry unto god day by day to put all his enemies to confusion etc when george ii died in october 1760 he records in his journal october 25 king george was gathered to his fathers when will england have a better prince one thinks of carlyle sartor 19 has not your red hangingindividual a horsehair wig squirrelskins and a plushgown whereby all mortals know that he is a judge society which the more i think of it astonishes me the more is founded upon clothwesley never despised form and ceremonial he robed himself even for his bible studies with his societies in london and bristol and for his openair services this paragraph finely and impressively composed as it is is a defiance of all sound exegesis some of the passages quoted refer to the invasion ofjudah by the assyrians some to the coming of the holy ghost some to the destruction of jerusalem by the romans some to the downfall of rome herself all these were is a sense days of jehovah but there is no warrant for transferring all these signs to the final day of judgement nor for their literal interpretation this just remark on the difference between the present and the resurrection bodies is worked out in detail in sermon 138 originally written by benjamincalamy and revised and abridged bywesley in 1732 substance and properties are here used in their philosophical sense the body will be the same in essence not composed of the same material particles but it propertiese its characteristics and qualities will be entirely changed above all it will be a pneumatical and not a physical bodyie it will be well adapted for the use and manifestation of the spirit as the present body is adapted for the use and manifestation of the psyche or animal soul hades is a very properly substituted for the av hell which is here and indeed in all passages where is the translation of sheol orhades most misleading to the english reader it is the world of departed spirits not the place of punishment of the devil and his angels all nations  more exactly all the gentiles this account of the judgement refers only to the judgement of the heathen nations who have not heard of christ and the standard of judgement is according not their relation to him but theirfulfillment of the common human duties of kindliness and charity there set out it is a supplement to the three preceding parables of the steward the virgins and the talents the first describing the judgement of the christian minister the second and third the two sides of the judgment of those who have heard the gospel first from the point of view of faith second from the point of view of works the beloved disciplewesley of course accepts the johannine authorship of the apocalypse outbeaming more exact than the av brightness the son is to the father as the rays of light are to the sun thought it not robbery better thought it not an object to be grasped at to be equal with god he laid aside for the time his equality with the father which was therefore restored to him when god gave him the name that is above every name pole quotes from joseph mede quod jamdixi diem judicii non intelligi velim de die brevi sive paucarum horarum sed de spatio mile annorum quibus dies illa durabit ie the day of judgement is not to understood as a short day of a few hours but as the space of a thousand years during which that day will last the eminent writer is edward young the author of night thoughts the quotation is from his poem the last day 1721 219 the original runs to smooth and lengthen out th unbounded space twice a planetary height young 2282 says now the descending triumph stops its flight from earth full twice a planetary height presumably he means twice as far from the earth as the farthest planet all this seems rather solemn trifling  four hundred millions it is now estimated as more or less fifteen hundred millions but a few millions more or less are not worth considering in such an altogether   indeterminate calculation as this the quotation is again from young 2193wesley protest vigorously against any one altering his own or his brothers verse but he never hesitates to do the same thing to other peoples the original passage in young runs  great xerxes world in arms proud cannaes field where carthage taught victorious rome to yield immortal blenheim famd ramillias host they all are here and here they are lost their millions sell to be discerned in vain lost as a billow in th unbounded main the quotation is from virgils aeneid 6567 the subject of the verbs isrhadamanthus the mythical judge of the dead no translation is furnished in the 1771ed modern editions givedrydens version the meaning is rhadamanthus of gnosus here holds his iron sway and scourges them and hears their guile and compels each man to confess the expiations put off till death alas too late which were due for the crimes he committed on earth rejoicing in the vain hope that they might be concealed  to justify the way of god to man from miltons paradise lost 126 in the original the last line is men the third heaven paul 2 cor 122 tells how he was caught up into the third heave or paradise and heard unutterable words which it is not in the power of man to speak it is doubtful where he thought of three heavens only  viz the heaven of the atmosphere and clouds the heaven of the sun and stars and the heaven of the blessed dead  or accepted the jewish belief in seven heavens of which paradise was the third in order from belowwesley admits of no hope for the finally impenitent and interprets literally these passages which speak of their doom in the first however hell is sheol and all that the psalmist says is that all the nations no the people that forget god will depart in to the world of the dead in the sermon 73 on hell he is quite explicit as to his belief in the endless torment of the wicked in material fire neither of these sermons are however part of the standard methodist doctrine the finale destruction of the earth by means of fires is quite within the bounds of possibility the impact of some wandering star would generate heat enough for the purpose of it may be that gravitation will at last overcome the centrifugal force and the arch will fall into the sun but such speculations are as fruitless as they are uncertain and the idea in the next paragraph of the origin of the sea of glass is merely grotesque cicero is the author of the phrase minute philosophers he speaks in desenect 23 of quidam minuti philosophi meaning trifling insignificant in english use it rather means meticulous overprecise speculators all this discussion as to quantity of fire is absurd fire is not a thing  but a state of violent chemical combination a match is quite enough to kindle a conflagration if there be fuel enoughwesley was keenly interested in electrical phenomena and was the first man in england to make use of it as a curative agent his pamphlet called the desideratum or electricity made plain and useful published in 1760 details many of franklins experiments such as drawing sparks out of the human body or from the fur of a cat this is what he is thinking of when he says that our bodies are full of fire freethinker was a name claimed by the deists and other rejecters of the christian revelation at the beginning of the eighteenth century here wesley uses it ofovid the roman poet with a kind of suggestion that the modern freethinkers were akin to him in their religious views the quotation is from the metamorphoses 1256 where jupiter preparing to hurl his thunderbolts hesitates to do so lest he should set the ether aflame for he remembers that it is amongst the decrees of the fates that a time will come when the sea the earth and the palace of heaven shall catch fire and blaze and the mass of the world so laboriously constructed shall be imperilled your in conscience so the author of the old kentish poema morale says elch man sceal him then biclupien and ecach sceal him demen his aye weorc and his ithanc to witnesse he sceal temen which is being interpreted every man shall accuse himself there and every man shall judge himself his own work and his conscience he shall bring to witness see see hecometh one of wesleys finest and most impassioned perorations   sermon 16 text of the 1872 edition the means of grace ye are gone away from mine ordinances and have not kept themmal 37 i 1 but are there any ordinances now since life and immortality were brought to light by the gospel are there under the christian dispensation any means ordained of god as the usual channels of his grace this question could never have been proposed in theapostolical church unless by one who openly avowed himself to be a heathen the whole body of christians being agreed that christ had ordained certain outward means for conveying his grace into the souls of men their constant practice set this beyond all dispute for so long as all that believed were together and had all things common acts 244 they continued steadfastly in the teaching of the apostles and in the breaking of bread and in prayers acts 242 but in process of time when the love of many waxed cold some began to mistake the means for the end and to place religion rather in doing those outward works than in a heart renewed after the image of god they forgot that the end of every commandment is love out of a pure heart with faith unfeigned the loving the lord their god with all their heart and their neighbour as themselves and the being purified from pride anger and evil desire by a faith of the operation of god others seemed to imagine that though religion did not principally consist in these outward means yet there was something in them wherewith god was well pleased something that would still make them acceptable in his sight though they were not exact in the weightier matters of the law in justice mercy and the love of god it is evident in those who abused them thus they did not conduce to the end for which they were ordained rather the things which should have been for their health were to them an occasion of falling they were so far from receiving any blessing therein that they only drew down a curse upon their head so far from growing more heavenly in heart and life that they were twofold more the children of hell than before others clearly perceiving that these means did not convey the grace of god to those children of the devil began from this particular case to draw a general conclusion  that they were not means of conveying the grace of god yet the number of those who abused the ordinances of god was far greater than of those who despised them till certain men arose not only of great understanding sometimes joined with considerable learning but who likewise appeared to be men of love experimentally acquainted with true inward religion some of these were burning and shining lights persons famous in their generations and such as had well deserved of the church of christ for standing in the gap against the overflowings of ungodliness it cannot be supposed that these holy and venerable men intended any more at first than to show that outward religion is nothing worth without the religion of the heart that god is a spirit and they who worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth that therefore external worship is lost labour without a heart devoted to god that the outward ordinances of god then profit much when they advance inward holiness but when they advance it not are unprofitable and void are lighter than vanity yea that when they are used as it were in the place of this they are an utter abomination to the lord 5 yet is it not strange if some of these being strongly convinced of that horrid profanation of the ordinances of god which had spread itself over the whole church and well nigh driven true religion out of the world  in their fervent zeal for the glory of god and the recovery of souls from that fatal delusion  spake as if outward religion were absolutely nothing as if it had no place in the religion of christ it is not surprising at all if they should not always have expressed themselves with sufficient caution so that unwary hearers might believe they condemned all outward means as   altogether unprofitable and as not designed of god to be the ordinary channels of conveying his grace into the souls of men nay it is not impossible some of these holy men did at length themselves fall into this opinion in particular those who not by choice but by the providence of god were cut off from all these ordinances perhaps wandering up and down having no certain abidingplace or dwelling in dens and caves of the earth these experiencing the grace of god in themselves though they were deprived of all outward means might infer that the same grace would be given to them who of set purpose abstained from them 6 and experience shows how easily this notion spreads and insinuates itself into the minds of men especially of those who arethroughly awakened out of the sleep of death and begin to feel the weight of their sins a burden too heavy to be borne these are usually impatient of their present state and trying every way to escape from it they are always ready to catch at any new thing any new proposal of ease or happiness they have probably tried most outward means and found no ease in them it may be more and more of remorse and fear and sorrow and condemnation it is easy therefore to persuade these that it is better for them to abstain from all those means they are already weary of striving as it seems in vain of labouring in the fire and are therefore glad of any pretence to cast aside that wherein their soul has no pleasure to give over the painful strife and sink down into an indolent inactivity  ii 1 in the following discourse i propose to examine at large whether there are any means of grace by means of grace i understand outward signs words or actions ordained of god and appointed for this end to be the ordinary channels whereby he might convey to men preventing justifying or sanctifying grace i use this expression means of grace because i know none better and because it has been generally used in the christian church for many ages  in particular by our own church which directs us to bless god both for the means of grace and hope of glory and teaches us that a sacrament is an outward sign of inward grace and a means whereby we receive the same the chief of these means are prayer whether in secret or with the great congregation searching the scriptures which implies reading hearing and meditating thereon and receiving the lords supper eating bread and drinking wine in remembrance of him and these we believe to be ordained of god as the ordinary channels of conveying his grace to the souls of men but we allow that the whole value of the means depends on their actual subservience to the end of religion that consequently all these means when separate from the end are less than nothing and vanity that if they do not actually conduce to the knowledge and love of god they are not acceptable in his sight yea rather they are an abomination before him a stink in his nostrils he is weary to bear them above all if they are used as a kind of commutation for the religion they were designed to subserve it is not easy to find words for the enormous folly and wickedness of thus turning gods arms against himself of keeping christianity out of the heart by those very means which were ordained for the bringing it in we allow likewise that all outward means whatever if separate from the spirit of god cannot profit at all cannot conduce in any degree either to the knowledge or love of god without controversy the help that is done upon earth he doeth it himself it is he alone who by his own almighty power worketh in us what is pleasing in his sight and all outward things unless he work in them and by them are mere weak and beggarly elements whosoever therefore imagines there is any intrinsic power in any means whatsoever does greatly err not knowing the scriptures neither the power of god we know that there is no inherent power in the words that are spoken in prayer in the letter of scripture read the sound thereof heard or the bread and wine received in the lords supper but that it is god alone who is the giver of every good gift the author of all grace that the whole power is of him whereby through any of these there is any blessing conveyed to our soul we know likewise that he is able to give the same grace though there were no means on the face of the earth   in this sense we may affirm that with regard to god there is no such thing as means seeing he is equally able to work whatsoeverpleaseth him by any or by none at all we allow farther that the use of all means whatever will never atone for one sin that it is the blood of christ alone whereby any sinner can be reconciled to god there being no other propitiation for our sins no other fountain for sin and uncleanness every believer in christ is deeply convinced that there is no merit but in him that there is no merit in any of his own works not in uttering the prayer or searching the scripture or hearing the word of god or eating of that bread and drinking of that cup so that if no more be intended by the expression some have used christ is the only means of grace than this  that he is the only meritorious cause of it it cannot begainsayed by any who know the grace of god  yet once more we allow though it is a melancholy truth that a large proportion of those who are called christians do to this day abuse the means of grace to the destruction of their souls this is doubtless the case with all those who rest content in the form of godliness without the power either they fondly presume they are christians already because they do thus and thus although christ was never yet revealed in their hearts nor the love of god shed abroad therein  or else they suppose they shall infallibly be so barely because they use these means idly dreaming though perhaps hardly conscious thereof either that there is some kind of power therein whereby sooner or later they know not when they shall certainly be made holy or that there is a sort of merit in using them which will surely move god to give them holiness or accept them without it so little do they understand that great foundation of the whole christian building by grace are ye saved ye are saved from your sins from the guilt and power thereof ye are restored to the favour and image of god not for any works merits ordeservings of yours but by the free grace the mere mercy of god through the merits of his wellbeloved son ye are thus saved not by any power wisdom or strength which is in you or in any other creature but merely through the grace or power of the holy ghost whichworketh all in all but the main question remains we know this salvation is the gift and the work of god but how may one say who is convinced he hath it not may i attain thereto if you say believe and thou shalt be saved he answers true but how shall i believe you reply wait upon god well but how am i to wait in the means of grace or out of them am i to wait for the grace of god which bringeth salvation by using these means or by laying them aside it cannot possibly be conceived that the word of god should give no direction in so important a point or that the son of god who came down from heaven for us men and for our salvation should have left us undetermined with regard to a question wherein our salvation is so nearly concerned and in fact he hath not left us undetermined he hath shown us the way wherein we should go we have only to consult the oracles of god to inquire what is written there and if we simply abide by their decision there can no possible doubt remain iii 1 according to this according to the decision of holy writ all who desire the grace of god are to wait for it in the means which he hath ordained in using not in laying them aside and first all who desire the grace of god are to wait for it in the way of prayer this is the express direction of our lord himself in his sermon upon the mount after explaining at large wherein religion consists and describing the main branches of it he adds ask and it shall be given you seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you for everyone thatasketh receiveth and he that seeketh findeth and to him that knocketh it shall be opened matt 77 8 here we are in the plainest manner directed to ask in order to or as a means of receiving to seek in order to find the grace of god the pearl of great price and to knock to continue asking and seeking if we would enter into his kingdom 2 that no doubt might remain our lord labours this point in a more peculiar manner he appeals to every mans own heart what man is there of you who if his son ask bread will give him a stone or if he ask a fish will he give him a serpent if ye then being evil know how to give good gifts   unto your children how much more shall your father which is in heaven the father of angels and men the father of the spirits of all flesh give good things to them that ask him matt 7911 or as he expresses himself on another occasion including all good things in one how much more shall your heavenly father give the holy spirit to them that ask him luke 1113 it should be particularly observed here that the persons directed to ask had not then received the holy spirit nevertheless our lord directs them to use this means and promises that it should be effectual that upon asking they should receive the holy spirit from him whose mercy is over all his works the absolute necessity of using this means if we would receive any gift from god yet farther appears from that remarkable passage which immediately precedes these words and he said unto them whom he had just been teaching how to pray which of you shall have a friend and shall go unto him at midnight and shall say unto him friend lend me three loaves and he from within shall answer trouble me not i cannot rise and give thee i say unto you though he will not rise and give him because he is his friend yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needeth and i say unto you ask and it shall be given youluke 115 79 though he will not give him because he is his friend yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needeth how could our blessed lord more plainly declare that we may receive of god by this means by importunately asking what otherwise we should not receive at all he spake also another parable to this end that men ought always to pray and not to faint till through this means they should receive of god whatsoever petition they asked of him there was in a city a judge which feared not god neither regarded man and there was a widow in that city and she came unto him saying avenge me of my adversary and he would not for a while but afterward he said within himself though i fear not god nor regard man yet because this widowtroubleth me i will avenge her lest by her continual coming she weary me luke 1815 the application of this our lord himself hath made hear what the unjust judge saith because she continues to ask because she will take no denial therefore i will avenge her and shall not god avenge his own elect which cry day and night unto him i tell you he will avenge them speedily if they pray and faint not a direction equally full and express to wait for the blessings of god in private prayer together with a positive promise that by this means we shall obtain the request of our lips he hath given us in those wellknown words enter into thy closet and when thou hast shut thy door pray to thy father which is in secret and thy father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly matt 66 if it be possible for any direction to be more clear it is that which god hath given us by the apostle with regard to prayer of every kind public or private and the blessing annexed thereto if any of you lack wisdom let him ask of god thatgiveth to all men liberally if they ask otherwise ye have not because ye ask not james 42 andupbraideth not and it shall be given him james 15  if it be objected but this is no direction to unbelievers to them who know not the pardoning grace of god for the apostle adds but let him ask in faith otherwise let him not think that he shall receive any thing of the lord i answer the meaning of the word faith in this place is fixed by the apostle himself as if it were on purpose to obviate this objection in the following let him ask in faith nothing wavering nothing doubting meden dikrinomenos not doubting but godheareth his prayer and will fulfil the desire of his heart the gross blasphemous absurdity of supposing faith in this place to be taken in the full christian meaning appears hence it is supposing the holy ghost to direct a man who knows he has not faith which is here termed wisdom to ask it of god with a positive promise that it shall be given him and then immediately to subjoin that it shall not be given him unless he have it before he asks for it but who can bear such a supposition from thisscripture therefore as well as those cited above we must infer that all who desire the grace of god are to wait for it in the way of prayer 7 secondly all who desire the grace of god are to wait for it in searching the scriptures   our lords direction with regard to the use of this means is likewise plain and clear search the scriptures saith he to the unbelieving jews for they testify of me john 539 and for this very end did he direct them to search the scriptures that they might believe in him the objection that this is not a command but only an assertion that they did search the scriptures is shamelessly false i desire those who urge it to let us know how a command can be more clearly expressed than in those terms ereunate tas graphas it is as peremptory as so many words can make it and what a blessing from god attends the use of this means appears from what is recorded concerning the bereans who after hearing st paul searched the scriptures daily whether those things were so therefore many of them believed  found the grace of god in the way which he had ordained acts 1711 12 it is probable indeed that in some of those who had received the word with all readiness of mind faith came as the same apostle speaks by hearing and was only confirmed by reading the scriptures but it was observed above that under the general term of searching the scriptures both hearing reading and meditating are contained and that this is a means whereby god not only gives but also confirms and increases true wisdom we learn from the words of st paul to timothy from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in christ jesus 2tim 315 the same truth namely that this is the great means god has ordained for conveying his manifold grace to man is delivered in the fullest manner that can be conceived in the words which immediately follow all scripture is given by inspiration of god consequently all scripture is infallibly true and is profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness to the end that the man of god may be perfectthroughly furnished unto all good works 2 tim 316 17  it should be observed that this is spoken primarily and directly of the scriptures which timothy had known from a child which must have been those of the old testament for the new was not then wrote how far then was st paul though he was not a whit behind the very chief of the apostles nor therefore i presume behind any man now upon earth from making light of the old testament behold this lest ye one day wonder and perish ye who make so small account of one half of the oracles of god yea and that half of which the holy ghost expressly declares that it is profitable as a means ordained of god for this very thing for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness to the end the man of god may be perfectthroughly furnished unto all good works  nor is this profitable only for the men of god for those who walk already in the light of his countenance but also for those who are yet in darkness seeking him whom they know not thus st peter we have also a more sure word of prophecy literally and we have the prophetic word more sure kai echomen bebaioteron ton prophetikon logon confirmed by our being eyewitnesses of his majesty and hearing the voice which came from the excellent glory unto which  prophetic word so he styles the holy scriptures  ye do well that ye take heed as unto a light that shineth in a dark place until the day dawn and the daystar arise in your hearts 2 peter 119 let all therefore who desire that day to dawn upon their hearts wait for it in searching the scriptures thirdly all who desire an increase of the grace of god are to wait for it in partaking of the lords supper for this also is a direction himself hath given the same night in which he was betrayed he took bread and brake it and said take eat this is my body that is the sacred sign of my body this do in remembrance of me likewise he took the cup saying this cup is the new testament or covenant in my blood the sacred sign of that covenant this do ye in remembrance of me for as often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup ye do show forth the lords death till he come 1 cor 1123 c ye openly exhibit the same by these visible signs before god and angels and men ye manifest your solemn remembrance of his death till hecometh in the clouds of heaven   only let a man first examine himself whether he understand the nature and design of this holy institution and whether he really desire to be himself made conformable to the death of christ and so nothing doubting let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup 1 cor 1128 here then the direction first given by our lord is expressly repeated by the apostle let him eat let him drink esthieto pineto both in the imperative mood words not implying a bare permission only but a clear explicit command a command to all those either who already are filled with peace and joy in believing or who can truly say the remembrance of our sins is grievous unto us the burden of them is intolerable 12 and that this is also an ordinary stated means of receiving the grace of god is evident from those words of the apostle which occur in the preceding chapter the cup of blessing which we bless is it not the communion or communication of the blood of christ the bread which we break is it not the communion of the body of christ 1 cor 1016 is not the eating of that bread and the drinking of that cup the outward visible means whereby god conveys into our souls all that spiritual grace that righteousness and peace and joy in the holy ghost which were purchased by the body of christ once broken and the blood of christ once shed for us let all therefore who truly desire the grace of god eat of that bread and drink of that cup iv 1 but as plainly as god hath pointed out the way wherein he will be inquired after innumerable are the objections which men wise in their own eyes have from time to time raised against it it may be needful to consider a few of these not because they are of weight in themselves but because they have so often been used especially of late years to turn the lame out of the way yea to trouble and subvert those who did run well till satan appeared as an angel of light the first and chief of these is you cannot use these means as you call them without trusting in them i pray where is this written i expect you should show me plain scripture for your assertion otherwise i dare not receive it because i am not convinced that you are wiser than god if it really had been as you assert it is certain christ must have known it and if he had known it he would surely have warned us he would have revealed it long ago therefore because he has not because there is no tittle of this in the whole revelation of jesus christ i am as fully assured your assertion is false as that this revelation is of god however leave them off for a short time to see whether you trusted in them or no so i am to disobey god in order to know whether i trust in obeying him and do you avow this advice do you deliberately teach to do evil that good may come o tremble at the sentence of god against such teachers their damnation is just nay if you are troubled when you leave them off it is plain you trusted in them by no means if i am troubled when i wilfully disobey god it is plain his spirit is still striving with me but if i am not troubled at wilful sin it is plain i am given up to a reprobate mind but what do you mean by trusting in them  looking for the blessing of god therein believing that if i wait in this way i shall attain what otherwise i should not so i do and so i will god being my helper even to my lifes end by the grace of god i will thus trust in them till the day of my death that is i will believe that whatever god hath promised he is faithful also to perform and seeing he hath promised to bless me in this way i trust it shall be according to his word 2 it has been secondly objected this is seeking salvation by works do you know the meaning of the expression you use what is seeking salvation by works in the writings of st paul it means either seeking to be saved by observing the ritual works of the mosaic law or expecting salvation for the sake of our own works by the merit of our own righteousness but how is either of these implied in my waiting in the way god has ordained and expecting that he will meet me there because he has promised so to do   i do expect that he will fulfil his word that he will meet and bless me in this way yet not for the sake of any works which i have done nor for the merit of my righteousness but merely through the merits and sufferings and love of his son in whom he is always well pleased it has been vehemently objected thirdly that christ is the only means of grace i answer this is mere playing upon words explain your term and the objection vanishes away when we say prayer is a means of grace we understand a channel through which the grace of god is conveyed when you say christ is the means of grace you understand the sole price and purchaser of it or that no man cometh unto the father but through him and who denies it but this is utterly wide of the question but does not the scripture it has been objected fourthly direct us to wait for salvation does not david say my soulwaiteth upon god for of himcometh my salvation and does notisaiah teach us the same thing saying o lord we have waited for thee all this cannot be denied seeing it is the gift of god we are undoubtedly to wait on him for salvation but how shall we wait if god himself has appointed a way can you find a better way of waiting for him but that he hath appointed a way hath been shown at large and also what that way is the very words of the prophet which you cite put this out of the question for the whole sentence runs thus  in the way of thy judgments or ordinances o lord have we waited for thee isaiah 268 and in the very same way did david wait as his own words abundantly testify i have waited for thy saving health o lord and have kept thy law teach me o lord the way of thy statutes and i shall to keep it unto the end yea say some but god has appointed another way  stand still and see the salvation of god let us examine the scriptures to which you refer the first of them with the context runs thus  and when pharaoh drew nigh the children of israel lifted up their eyes and they were sore afraid and they said unto moses because there were no graves in egypt hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness and moses said unto the people fear ye not stand still and see the salvation of the lord and the lord said unto moses speak unto the children of israel that they go forward but lift thou up thy rod and stretch out thine hand over the sea and divide it and the children of israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea exod 1410 c this was the salvation of god which they stood still to see by marching forward with all their might the other passage wherein this expression occurs stands thus there came some that told jehoshaphat saying there cometh a great multitude against thee from beyond the sea and jehoshaphat feared and set himself to seek the lord and proclaimed a fast throughout alljudah and judah gathered themselves together to ask help of the lord even out of all the cities they came to seek the lord and jehoshaphat stood in the congregation in the house of the lord  then upon jahaziel came the spirit of the lord and he said be not dismayed by reason of this great multitude tomorrow go ye down against them ye shall not need to fight in this battle set yourselves stand ye still and see the salvation of the lord and they rose early in the morning and went forth and when they began to sing and to praise the lord setambushments against the children of moab ammon and mount seir  and everyone helped to destroy another 2chron 202 c such was the salvation which the children ofjudah saw but how does all this prove that we ought not to wait for the grace of god in the means which he hath ordained 6 i shall mention but one objection more which indeed does not properly belong to this head nevertheless because it has been so frequently urged i may not wholly pass it by does not st paul say if ye be dead with christ why are ye subject to ordinances col 220 therefore a christian one that is dead with christ need not use the ordinances any more so you say if i am a christian i am not subject to the ordinances of christ surely by the absurdity of this you must see at the first glance that the ordinances here mentioned cannot be the ordinances   of christ that they must needs be the jewish ordinances to which it is certain a christian is no longer subject and the same undeniably appears from the words immediately following touch not taste not handle not all evidently referring to the ancient ordinances of the jewish law so that this objection is the weakest of all and in spite of all that great truth must stand unshaken   that all who desire the grace of god are to wait for it in the means which he hath ordained v 1 but this being allowed that all who desire the grace of god are to wait for it in the means he hath ordained it may still be inquired how those means should be used both as to the order and the manner of using them with regard to the former we may observe there is a kind of order wherein god himself is generally pleased to use these means in bringing a sinner to salvation a stupid senseless wretch is going on in his own way not having god in all his thoughts when god comes upon him unawares perhaps by an awakening sermon or conversation perhaps by some awful providence or it may be an immediate stroke of his convincing spirit without any outward means at all having now a desire to flee from the wrath to come he purposely goes to hear how it may be done if he finds a preacher who speaks to the heart he is amazed and begins searching the scriptures whether these things are so the more he hears and reads the more convinced he is and the more he meditates thereon day and night perhaps he finds some other book which explains and enforces what he has heard and read in scripture and by all these means the arrows of conviction sink deeper into his soul he begins also to talk of the things of god which are ever uppermost in his thoughts yea and to talk with god to pray to him although through fear and shame he scarce knows what to say but whether he can speak or no he cannot but pray were it only in groans which cannot be uttered yet being in doubt whether the high and lofty one that inhabiteth eternity will regard such a sinner as him he wants to pray with those who know god with the faithful in the great congregation but here he observes others go up to the table of the lord he considers christ has said do this how is it that i do not i am too great a sinner i am not fit i am not worthy after struggling with these scruples a while he breaks through and thus he continues in gods way in hearing reading meditating praying and partaking of the lords supper till god in the manner that pleases him speaks to his heart thy faith hath saved thee go in peace  by observing this order of god we may learn what means to recommend to any particular soul if any of these will reach a stupid careless sinner it is probably hearing or conversation to such therefore we might recommend these if he has ever any thought about salvation to one who begins to feel the weight of his sins not only hearing the word of god but reading it too and perhaps other serious books may be a means of deeper conviction may you not advise him also to meditate on what he reads that it may have its full force upon his heart yea and to speak thereof and not be ashamed particularly among those who walk in the same path when trouble and heaviness take hold upon him should you not then earnestly exhort him to pour out his soul before god always to pray and not to faint and when he feels the worthlessness of his own prayers are you not to work together with god and remind him of going up into the house of the lord and praying with all that fear him but if he does this the dying word of his lord will soon be brought to his remembrance a plain intimation that this is the time when we should second the motions of the blessed spirit and thus may we lead him step by step through all the means which god has ordained not according to our own will but just as the providence and the spirit of god go before and open the way yet as we find no command in holy writ for any particular order to be observed herein so neither do the providence and the spirit of god adhere to any without variation but the means into which different men are led and in which they find the blessing of god are varied transposed and combined together a thousand different ways yet still our wisdom is to follow the leadings of his providence and his spirit to be guided herein more especially as to the means wherein we ourselves seek the grace of god partly by his outward providence giving us the opportunity of using sometimes one means sometimes another partly by our experience which it is whereby his free spirit is pleased most to work in our heart and in the mean time the sure and general rule for all who   groan for the salvation of god is this  whenever opportunity serves use all the means which god has ordained for who knows in which god will meet thee with the grace thatbringeth salvation 4 as to the manner of using them whereon indeed it wholly depends whether they should convey any grace at all to the user it behoves us first always to retain a lively sense that god is above all means have a care therefore of limiting the almighty he doeth whatsoever and whensoever it pleaseth him he can convey his grace either in or out of any of the means which he hath appointed perhaps he will who hath known the mind of the lord or who hath been his counsellor look then every moment for his appearing be it at the hour you are employed in his ordinances or before or after that hour or when you are hindered therefrom he is not hindered he is always ready always able always willing to save it is the lord let him do whatseemeth him good secondly before you use any means let it be deeply impressed on your soul  there is no power in this it is in itself a poor dead empty thing separate from god it is a dry leaf a shadow neither is there any merit in my using this nothing intrinsically pleasing to god nothing whereby i deserve any favour at his hands no not a drop of water to cool my tongue but because god bids therefore i do because he directs me to wait in this way therefore here i wait for his free mercy whereofcometh my salvation settle this in your heart that the opus operatum the mere work done profiteth nothing that there is no power to save but in the spirit of god no merit but in the blood of christ that consequently even what god ordains conveys no grace to the soul if you trust not in him alone on the other hand he that does truly trust in him cannot fall short of the grace of god even though he were cut off from every outward ordinance though he were shut up in the centre of the earth thirdly in using all means seek god alone in and through every outward thing look singly to the power of his spirit and the merits of his son beware you do not stick in the work itself if you do it is all lost labour nothing short of god can satisfy your soul therefore eye him in all through all and above all remember also to use all means asmeans as ordained not for their own sake but in order to the renewal of your soul in righteousness and true holiness if therefore they actually tend to this well but if not they are dung and dross lastly after you have used any of these take care how you value yourself thereon how you congratulate yourself as having done some great thing this is turning all into poison think if god was not there what does this avail have i not been adding sin to sin how long o lord save or i perish o lay not this sin to my charge if god was there if his love flowed into your heart you have forgot as it were the outward work you see you know you feel god is all in all be abased sink down before him give him all the praise let god in all things be glorified through christ jesus let all your bones cry out my song shall be always of the lovingkindness of the lord with my mouth will i ever be telling of thy truth from one generation to another   sermon 17 text from the 1872 edition the circumcision of the heart preached at st marys oxford before the university on january 1 1733 circumcision is that of the heart in the spirit and not in the letter romans 229 it is the melancholy remark of an excellent man that he who now preaches the most essential duties of christianity runs the hazard of being esteemed by a great part of his hearers a setter forth of new doctrines most men have so lived away the substance of that religion the profession whereof they still retain that no sooner are any of those truths proposed which difference the spirit of christ from the spirit of the world than they cry out thoubringest strange things to our ears we would know what these things mean  though he is only preaching to them jesus and the resurrection with the necessary consequence of it  if christ be risen ye ought then to die unto the world and to live wholly unto god  a hard saying this to the natural man who is alive unto the world and dead unto god and one that he will not readily be persuaded to receive as the truth of god unless it be so qualified in the interpretation as to have neither use nor significance left he receiveth not the word of the spirit of god taken in their plain and obvious meaning they are foolishness unto him neither indeed can he know them because they are spiritually discerned  they are perceivable only by that spiritual sense which in him was never yetawakened for want of which he must reject as idle fancies of men what are both the wisdom and the power of god that circumcision is that of the heart in the spirit and not in the letter  that the distinguishing mark of a true follower of christ of one who is in a state of acceptance with god is not either outward circumcision or baptism or any other outward form but a right state of soul a mind and spirit renewed after the image of him that created it  is one of those important truths that can only be spiritually discerned and this the apostle himself intimates in the next words  whose praise is not of men but of god as if he had said expect not whoever thou art who thusfollowest thy great master that the world the one who follow him not will say well done good and faithful servant know that the circumcision of the heart the seal of thy calling is foolishness with the world be content to wait for thy applause till the day of thy lords appearing in that day shalt thou have praise of god in the great assembly of men and angels i design first particularly to inquire wherein this circumcision of the heart consists and secondly to mention some reflections that naturally arise from such an inquiry i 1 i am first to inquire wherein that circumcision of the heart consists which will receive the praise of god in general we may observe it is that habitual disposition of soul which in the sacred writings is termed holiness and which directly implies the being cleansed from sin from all filthiness both of flesh and spirit and by consequence the being endued with those virtues which were also in christ jesus the being so renewed in the spirit of our mind as to be perfect as our father in heaven is perfect 2 to be more particular circumcision of heart implies humility faith hope and charity humility a right judgment of ourselves cleanses our minds from those high conceits of our own perfection from that undue opinion of our own abilities andattainments which are the genuine fruit of a corrupted nature this entirely cuts off that vain thought i am rich and wise and have need of nothing and convinces us that we are by nature wretched and poor and miserable and blind and naked it convinces us that in our best estate we are of ourselves all sin and vanity that confusion and ignorance and error reign over our understanding that unreasonable earthly sensual devilish passions usurp authority over our will in a word that there is no whole part in our soul that all the foundations of our nature are out of course   at the same time we are convinced that we are not sufficient of ourselves to help ourselves that without the spirit of god we can do nothing but add sin to sin that it is he alone whoworketh in us by his almighty power either to will or do that which is good it being as impossible for us even to think a good thought without the supernatural assistance of his spirit as to create ourselves or to renew our whole souls in righteousness and true holiness a sure effect of our having formed this right judgment of the sinfulness and helplessness of our nature is a disregard of that honor which cometh of man which is usually paid to some supposed excellency in us he who knows himself neither desires nor values the applause which he knows he deserves not it is therefore a very small thing with him to be judged by mans judgment he has all reason to think by comparing what it has said either for or against him with what he feels in his own breast that the world as well as the god of this world was a liar form the beginning and even as to those who are not of the world thought he would choose if it were the will of god that they should account of him as of one desirous to be found a faithful steward of his lords goods if haply this might be a means of enabling him to be of more use to his fellowservants yet as this is the one end of his wishing for their approbation so he does not at all rest upon it for he is assured that whatever god wills he can never want instruments to perform since he is able even of these stones to raise up servants to do his pleasure this is that lowliness of mind which they have learned of christ who follow his example and tread in his steps and this knowledge of their disease whereby they are more and more cleansed from one part of it pride and vanity disposes them to embrace with a willing mind the second thing implied in circumcision of the heart  that faith which alone is able to make them whole which is the one medicine given under heaven to heal their sickness the best guide of the blind the surest light of them that are in darkness the most perfect instructor of the foolish is faith but it must be such a faith as is mighty through god to the pulling down of strongholds  to the overturning all the prejudices of corrupt reason all the false maxims revered among men all evil customs and habits all that wisdom of the world which is foolishness with god as casteth down imaginations reasoning and every high thing thatexalteth itself against the knowledge of god andbringeth into captivity every thought to the obedience of christ all things are possible to him that thus believeth the eyes of his understanding being enlightened he sees what is his calling even to glorify god who hath bought him with so high a price in his body and in his spirit which now are gods by redemption as well as by creation he feels what is the exceeding greatness of this power who as he raise up christ from the dead so is able toquicken us dead in sin by his spirit whichdwelleth in us this is the victory which overcometh the world even our faith that faith which is not only an unshaken assent to all that god hath revealed in scripture  and in particular to those important truths jesus christ came into the world to save sinners he bare our sins in his own body on the tree he is the propitiation for our sins and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole worldnb the following part of this paragraph is now added to the sermon formerly preached  but likewise the revelation of christ in our hearts a divine evidence or conviction of his love his free unmerited love to me a sinner a sure confidence in his pardoning mercy wrought in us by the holy ghost a confidence whereby every true believer is enabled to bear witness i know that my redeemerliveth that i have an advocate with the father and that jesus christ the righteous is my lord and the propitiation for my sins  i know he hath loved me and given himself for me  he hath reconciled me even me to god and i have redemption through his blood even the forgiveness of sins 8 such a faith as this cannot fail to show evidently the power of him that inspires it by delivering his children from the yoke of sin and purging their consciences from dead works by strengthening them so that they are no longer constrained to obey sin in the desires there of but instead of yielding their members unto it as instruments of unrighteousness they now yield themselves entirely unto god as those that are alive from the dead    9 those who are thus by faith born of god have also strong consolation through hope this is the next thing which the circumcision of the heart implies even the testimony of their own spirit with the spirit which witnesses in their hearts that    n b the following part of this paragraph is now added to the sermon formerly preached they are the children of god indeed it is the same spirit who works in them that clear and cheerful confidence that their heart is upright toward god that good assurance that they now do through his grace the things which are acceptable in his sight that they are now in the path whichleadeth to life and shall by the mercy of god endure therein to the end it is he whogiveth them a lively expectation of receiving all good things at gods hand a joyous prospect of that crown of glory which is reserved in heaven for them by this anchor a christian is kept steady in the midst of the waves of this troublesome world and preserved from striking upon either of those fatal rocks  presumption or despair he is neither discouraged by the misconceived severity of his lord nor does he despise the riches of his goodness he neither apprehends the difficulties of the race set before him to be greater than he has strength to conquer nor expects there to be so little as to yield in the conquest till he has put forth all strength the experience he already has in the christian warfare as it assures him his labor is not in vain if whatever hisfindeth to do he doeth it with his might so it forbids his entertaining so vain a thought as that he can otherwise gain any advantage as that any virtue can be shown any praise attained by faint hearts and feeble hands or indeed by any but those who pursue the same course with the great apostle of the gentiles  i says he so run not as uncertainly so fight i not as one that beateth the air but i keep under my body and bring it into subjection lest by any means when i have preached to others i myself should be a castaway 10 by the same discipline is every good soldier of christ to inure himself to endure hardship confirmed and strengthened by this he will be able not only to renounce the works of darkness but every appetite too and every affection which is no subject to the law of god for every one saith st john who hath this hope purifieth himself even as he is pure it is his daily care by the grace of god in christ and through the blood of the covenant to purge the inmost recesses of his soul from the lusts that before possessed and defiled it fromuncleanness and envy and malice and wrath from every passion and temper that is after the flesh that either springs from or cherishes his native corruption as well knowing that he whose very body is the temple of god ought to admit into it nothing common or unclean and that holiness becometh that house for ever where the spirit of holiness vouchsafes to dwell 11 yetlackest thou one thing whosoever thou art that to a deep humility and a steadfast faith hast joined a lively hope and thereby in a good measure cleansed thy heart from its inbred pollution if thou wilt be perfect add to all these charity add love and thou hast the circumcision of the heart love is the fulfilling of the law the end of the commandment very excellent things are spoken of love it is the essence the spirit the life of all virtue it is not only the first and great command but it is all the commandments in one whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are amiable orhonorable if there be any virtue if there be any praise they are all comprised in this one word  love in this is perfection and glory and happiness the royal law of heaven and earth is this thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind and with all thy strength 12 not that this forbids us to love anything besides god it implies that we love our brother also nor yet does it forbid us as some have strangely imagined to take pleasure in any thing but god to suppose this is to suppose the fountain of holiness is directly the author of sin since he has inseparably annexed pleasure to the use of those creatures which are necessary to sustain the life he has given us this therefore can never be the meaning of his command what the real sense of it is both our blessed lord and his apostles tell us too frequently and too plainly to be misunderstood they all with one mouth bear witness that the true meaning of those several declarations the lord thy god is one lord thou shalt have no other gods but me thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy strength thou shalt cleave unto him the desire of thy soul shall be to his name  is no other than this the one perfect good shall be your one ultimate end one thing shall ye desire for its own sake  the fruition of him that is all in all one happiness shall ye propose to your souls even an union with him that made them the having fellowship with the father and the son the being joined to the lord in one spirit one design you are to pursue to the end of time  the enjoyment of god in time and in eternity desire other things so far as they tend to this love the creature as it leads to the creator but in every step you take be this the glorious point that terminates your view let every affection and thought and word and work be subordinate to this whatever ye desire or fear whatever ye seek or shun whatever ye think speak or do be it in order to your happiness in god the sole end us well as source of your being 13 have no end to ultimate end but god thus our lord one thing is needful and if thine eye be singly fixed on this one thing thy whole body shall be full of light thus st paul this one thing i do i press toward the mark for the prize of the   high calling in christ jesus thus st james cleanse your hands ye sinners and purify your hearts ye doubleminded thus st john love not the world neither the things that are in the world for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh the lust of the eye and the pride of life is not of the father but is of the world the seeking happiness in what gratifies either the desire of the flesh by agreeably striking upon the outward senses the desire of the eye of the imagination by its novelty greatness or beauty or the pride of life whether by pomp grandeur power or the usual consequence of them applause and admiration  is not of the father cometh not from neither is approved by the father of spirits but of the world it is the distinguishing mark of those who will not have him to reign over them  ii 1 thus have i particularly inquired what that circumcision of heart is which will obtain the praise of god i am in the second place to mention some reflections that naturally arise from such an inquiry as a plain rule whereby every man may judge of himself whether he be of the world or of god and first it is clear from what has been said that no man has a title to the praise of god unless his heart is circumcised by humility unless he is little and base and vile in his own eyes unless he is deeply convinced of that inbred corruption of his nature whereby be is very far gone from original righteousness being prone to all evil averse to all good corrupt and abominable having a carnal mind which is enmity against god and is not subject to the law of god nor indeed can be unless he continually feels in his inmost soul that without the spirit of god resting upon him he can neither think nor desire nor speak nor act anything good or wellpleasing in his sight no man i say has a title to the praise of god till he feels his want of god nor indeed till heseeketh that honor which cometh of god only and neither desires nor pursues that whichcometh of man unless so far only as it tends to this  another truth which naturally follows from what has been said is that none shall obtain thehonor that cometh of god unless his heart be circumcised by faith even a faith of the operation of god unless refusing to be any longer led by his senses appetites or passions or even by that blind leader of the blind so idolized by the world natural reason he lives and walks by faith directs every step as seeking him that is invisible looks not at the things that arc seen which are temporal but at the things that arc not seen which are eternal and governs all his desires designs and thoughts all his actions and conversations as one who is entered in within the veil where jesus sits at the right hand of god it were to be wished that they were better acquainted with this faith who employ much of their time and pains in laying another foundation in grounding religion on the eternal fitness of things on the intrinsic excellence of virtue and the beauty of actions flowing from it on the reasons as they term them of good and evil and the relations of beings to each other either these accounts of the grounds of christian duty coincide with the scriptural or not if they do why are well meaning men perplexed and drawn from the weightier matters of the law by a cloud of terms whereby the easiest truths are explained into obscurity  if they are not then itbehooves them to consider who is the author of this new doctrine whether he is likely to be an angel from heaven whopreacheth another gospel than that of christ jesus though if he were god not we hath pronounced his sentence let him be accursed  our gospel as it knows no other foundation of good works than faith or of faith than christ so it clearly informs us we are not his disciples while we either deny him to be the author or his spirit to be the inspirer an perfecter both of our faith and works if any man have not the spirit of christ he is none of his he alone can quicken those who are dead unto god can breathe into them the breath of christian life and so prevent accompany and follow them with his grace as to bring their good desires to good effect and as many as are thus led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god this is gods short and plain account of true religion and virtue and other foundation can no man lay 5 from what has been said we may thirdly learn that it none is truly led by the spirit unless that spirit bear witness with his spirit that he is a child of god unless he see the prize and the crown before him and rejoice in hope of the glory of god so greatly have they erred who have taught that in serving god we ought not to have a view to own happiness  nay but we are often and expressly taught of god to have respect unto the recompense of reward to balance toil with the joy set before us these light afflictions with that exceeding weight of glory yea we are aliens to the covenant of promise we are without god in the world until god of his abundant mercy hath   begotten us again unto a living hope of the inheritance incorruptible undefiled and thatfadeth not away but if these things are so it is high time for those persons to deal faithfully with their own souls who are so far from finding in themselves this joyful assurance that they fulfil the terms and shall obtain the promises of that covenant as to quarrel with the covenant itself and blaspheme the terms of it to complain they are too severe and that no man ever did or shall live up to them what is this but to reproach god as if he were a hard master requiring of his servants more than he enables them to perform   as if he had mocked the helpless works of his hands by binding them to impossibilities by commanding them to overcome where neither their own strength nor grace was sufficient for them  these blasphemers might almost persuade those to imagine themselves guiltless who in the contrary extreme hope to fulfil the commands of god without taking any pains at all vain hope  that a child of adam should ever expect to see the kingdom of christ and of god without striving without agonizing first to enter in at the strait gatethat one who v as conceived and born in sin and whose inward parts are very wickedness should once entertain a thought of being purified as his lord is pure unless he tread in his steps and take up his cross daily unless he cut off his right hand and pluck out the right eye and cast it from him   that he should ever dream of shaking off his old opinions passions tempers of being sanctified throughout in spirit soul and body without a constant and continued course of general selfdenial 8 what lees than this can we possibly infer from the abovecited words of st paul who living ill infirmities in reproaches in necessities in persecutions in distresses for christs sake who being full of signs and wonders and mighty deeds  who having been caught up into the third heaven  yet reckoned as a late author strongly expresses it that all his virtues would be insecure and even his salvation in danger without this constant selfdenial so run i says he not as uncertainly so fight i not as one that beateth the air which he plainly teaches us that he who does not thus run who does not thus deny himself daily does run uncertainly andfighteth to as little purpose as he that beateth the air 9 to as little purpose does he talk of fighting the fight of faith as vainly hope to attain the crown of incorruption as we may lastly infer from the preceding observations whose heart is not circumcised by love love cutting off both the lust of the flesh the lust of the eye and the pride of life  engaging the whole man body soul and spirit in the ardent pursuit of that one objectis so essential to a child of god that without it whosoeverliveth is counted dead before him though i speak with the tongues of men and of angels and have not love i am as sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal though i have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge and though i have all faith so as to remove mountains and have not love i am nothing nay though i give all my goods to feed the poor and my body to be burned and have not love it profit me nothing 10 here then is the sum of the perfect law this is the true circumcision of the heart let the spirit return to god that gave it with the whole train of its affections unto the place from whence all the rivers came thither let them flow again other sacrifices from us he would not but the living sacrifice of the heart he hath chosen let it be continual offered up to god through christ in flames of holy love and let no creature be suffered to share with him for he is a jealous god his throne will he not divide with another he will reign without a rival be no design no desire admitted there but what has him for its ultimate object this is the way where in those children of god once walked who being dead still speak to us desire not to live but to praise his name let all your thoughts words and works tend to his glory set your heart firm on him and on other things only as they are in and from him let your soul be filled with so entire a love of him that you may love nothing but for his sake have a pure intention of heart a steadfast regard to his glory in all your actions fix your eye upon the blessed hope of your calling and make all the things of the world minister unto it for then and not till then is that mind in us which was also in christ jesus when in every motion of our heart in every word of our tongue in every work of our hands we pursue nothing but in relation to him and in subordination to his pleasure when we too neither think nor speak nor act to fulfil our own will but the will of him that sent us when whether we eat or drink or whatever we do we do all to the glory of god   sermon 18 text of the 1872 edition the marks of the new birth so is every one that is born of the spirit john 38 how is every one that is born of the spirit  that is born again  born of god what is meant by the being born again the being born of god or being born of the spirit what is implied in the being a son or a child of god or having the spirit of adoption that these privileges by the free mercy of god are ordinarily annexed to baptism which is thence termed by our lord in a preceding verse the being born of water and of the spirit we know but we would know what these privileges are what is the new birth perhaps it is not needful to give a definition of this seeing the scripture gives none but as the question is of the deepest concern to every child of man since except a man be born again born of the spirit he cannot see the kingdom of god i propose to lay down the marks of it in the plainest manner just as i find them laid down in scripture i 1 the first of these and the foundation of all the rest is faith so st paul ye are all the children of god by faith in christ jesus gal 326 so st john to them gave he power exousian right or privilege it might rather be translated to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name which were born when they believed not of blood nor of the will of the flesh not by natural generation nor of the will of man like those children adopted by men in whom no inward change is thereby wrought but of god john 11213 and again in his general epistle whosoever believeth that jesus is the christ is born of god 1 john 51 but it is not a barely notional or speculative faith that is here spoken of by the apostles it is not a bare assent to this proposition jesus is the christ nor indeed to all the propositions contained in our creed or in the old and new testament it is not merely an assent to any or all these credible things as credible to say this were to say which who could hear that the devils were born of god for they have this faith they trembling believe both that jesus is the christ and that all scripture having been given by inspiration of god is true as god is true it is not only an assent to divine truth upon the testimony of god or upon the evidence of miracles for they also heard the words of his mouth and knew him to be a faithful and true witness they could not but receive the testimony he gave both of himself and of the father which sent him they saw likewise the mighty works which he did and thence believed that he came forth from god yet notwithstanding this faith they are still reserved in chains of darkness unto the judgment of the great day for all this is no more than a dead faith the true living christian faith which whosoever hath is born of god is not only an assent an act of the understanding but a disposition which god hath wrought in his heart a sure trust and confidence in god that through the merits of christ his sins are forgiven and he reconciled to the favour of god this implies that a man first renounce himself that in order to be found in christ to be accepted through him he totally rejects all confidence in the flesh that having nothing to pay having no trust in his own works or righteousness of any kind he comes to god as a lost miserable selfdestroyed selfcondemned undone helpless sinner as one whose mouth is utterly stopped and who is altogether guilty before god such a sense of sin commonly called despair by those who speak evil of the things they know not together with a full conviction such as no words can express that of christ onlycometh our salvation and an earnest desire of that salvation must precede a living faith a trust in him who for us paid our ransom by his death and fulfilled the law of his life this faith then whereby we are born of god is not only a belief of all the articles of our faith but also a true confidence of the mercy of god through our lord jesus christ  an immediate and constant fruit of this faith whereby we are born of god a fruit which can in no wise be separated from it no not for an hour is power over sin  power over outward sin of every   kind over every evil word and work for wheresoever the blood of christ is thus applied itpurgeth the conscience from dead works  and over inward sin for itpurifieth the heart from every unholy desire and temper this fruit of faith st paul has largely described in the sixth chapter of his epistle to the romans how shall we saith he who by faith are dead to sin live any longer therein our old man is crucified with christ that the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin  likewise reckon ye yourselves to be dead unto sin but alive unto god through jesus christ our lord let not sin therefore reign even in your mortal body but yield yourselves unto god as those that are alive from the dead for sin shall not have dominion over you  god be thanked that ye were the servants of sin  but being made free  the plain meaning is god be thanked that though ye were in time past the servants of sin yet now  being free from sin ye are become the servants of righteousness the same invaluable privilege of the sons of god is as strongly asserted by st john particularly with regard to the former branch of it namely power over outward sin after he had been crying out as one astonished at the depth of the riches of the goodness of god  behold what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of god beloved now are we the sons of god and it doth not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is 1 john 31 c  he soon adds whosoever is born of god doth not commit sin for his seedremaineth in him and he cannot sin because he is born of god 1 john 39 but some men will say true whosoever is born of god doth not commit sin habitually habitually whence is that i read it not it is not written in the book god plainly saith he doth not commit sin and thouaddest habitually who art thou that mendest the oracles of god  that addest to the words of this book beware i beseech thee lest god add to thee all the plagues that are written therein especially when the comment thouaddest is such as quite swallows up the text so that by this methodeia planes artful method of deceiving the precious promise is utterly lost by this kybeia anthropon tricking and shuffling of men the word of god is made of none effect o beware thou that thus takest from the words of this book that taking away the whole meaning and spirit from them leavest only what may indeed be termed a dead letter lest god take away thy part out of the book of life  suffer we the apostle to interpret his own words by the whole tenor of his discourse in the fifth verse of this chapter he had said ye know that he christ was manifested to take away our sins and in him is no sin what is the inference he draws from this whosoeverabideth in him sinneth not whosoever sinneth hath not seen him neither known him 1 john 36 to his enforcement of this important doctrine he premises an highly necessary caution little children let no man deceive you 1 john 37 for many willendeavor so to do to persuade you that you may be unrighteous that you may commit sin and yet be children of god he that doeth righteousness is righteous even as he is righteous he that committeth sin is of the devil for the devilsinneth from the beginning then follows whosoever is born of god doth not commit sin for his seedremaineth in him and he cannot sin because he is born of god in this adds the apostle the children of god are manifest and the children of the devil by this plain mark the committing or not committing sin are they distinguished from each other to the same effect are those words in his fifth chapter we know that whosoever is born of godsinneth not but he that is begotten of godkeepeth himself and that wicked one toucheth him not 1 john 318 another fruit of this living faith is peace for being justified by faith having all our sins blotted out we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ rom 51 this indeed our lord himself the night before his death solemnly bequeathed to all his followers peace saith he i leave with you you who believe in god and believe also in me my peace i give unto you not as the world giveth give i unto you let not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid john 1427 and again these things have i spoken unto you that in me ye might have peace john 1633 this is that peace of god whichpasseth all understanding that serenity of soul which it hath not entered into the heart of a natural man to conceive and which it is not possible for even the spiritual man to utter and it is a peace which all the powers of earth and hell are unable to take from him waves and storms beat upon it but they shake it not for it is founded upon a rock it keepeth the hearts and minds of the children of god at all times and in all places whether they are in ease or in pain in sickness or health in abundance or want they are happy in god in every state they have learned to be content yea to give thanks unto god through christ jesus being well assured   that whatsoever is is best because it is his will concerning them so that in all the vicissitudes of life their heart standeth fast believing in the lord ii 1 a second scriptural mark of those who are born of god is hope thus st peter speaking to all the children of god who were then scattered abroad saith blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope 1 peter 13 elpida zosan a lively or living hope saith the apostle because there is also a dead hope as well as a dead faith a hope which is not from god but from the enemy of god and man  as evidently appears by its fruits for as it is the offspring of pride so it is the parent of every evil word and work whereas every man that hath in him this living hope is holy as he thatcalleth him is holy every man that can truly say to his brethren in christ beloved now are we the sons of god and we shall see him as he is purifieth himself even as he is pure this hope implies first the testimony of our own spirit or conscience that we walk in simplicity and godly sincerity secondly the testimony of the spirit of god bearing witness with or to our spirit that we are the children of god and if children then heirs heirs of god and jointheirs with christ let us well observe what is here taught us by god himself touching this glorious privilege of his children who is it that is here said to bear witness not our spirit only but another even the spirit of god he it is who beareth witness with our spirit what is it he beareth witness of that we are the children of god and if children then heirs heirs of god and jointheirs with christ rom 816 17 if so be that we suffer with him if we deny ourselves if we take up our cross daily if we cheerfully endure persecution or reproach for his sake that we may also be glorified together and in whom doth the spirit of god bear this witness in all who are the children of god by this very argument does the apostle prove in the preceding verses that they are so as many saith he as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father it follows the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of god 81416 the variation of the phrase in the fifteenth verse is worthy our observation ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father ye as many as are the sons of god have in virtue of your sonship received that selfsame spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father we the apostles prophets teachers for so the word may not improperly be understood we through whom you have believed the ministers of christ and stewards of the mysteries of god as we and you have one lord so we have one spirit as we have one faith so we have one hope also we and you are sealed with one spirit of promise the earnest of your and of our inheritance the same spirit bearing witness with your and with our spirit that we are the children of god rom 81416  and thus is the scripture fulfilled blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted for it is easy to believe that though sorrow may precede this witness of gods spirit with our spirit indeed must in some degree while we groan under fear and a sense of the wrath of god abiding on us yet as soon as any man feeleth it in himself his sorrow is turned into joy whatsoever his pain may have been before yet as soon as that hour is come heremembereth the anguish no more for joy that he is born of god it may be many of you have now sorrow because you are aliens from the commonwealth of israel because you are conscious to yourselves that you have not this spirit that you are without hope and without god in the world but when the comforter is come then your heart shall rejoice yea your joy shall be full and that joy no mantaketh from you john 1622 we joy in god will ye say through our lord jesus christ by whom we have now received the atonement by whom we have access into this grace this state of grace of favour or reconciliation with god wherein we stand and rejoice in hope of the glory of godrom 52 ye saith st peter whom god hath begotten again unto a lively hope are kept by the power of god unto salvation wherein ye greatly rejoice though now for a season if need be ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations that the trial of your faith may be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of jesus christ in whom though now ye see him not ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory 1 peter 15 c unspeakable indeed it is not for the tongue of man to describe this joy in the holy ghost it is the hidden manna which no manknoweth save he that receiveth it   but this we know it not only remains but overflows in the depth of affliction are the consolations of god small with his children when all earthly comforts fail not so but when sufferings most abound the consolations of his spirit do much more abound insomuch that the sons of god laugh at destruction when it cometh at want pain hell and the grave as knowing him who hath the keys of death and hell and will shortly cast them into the bottomless pit as hearing even now the great voice out of heaven saying behold the tabernacle of god is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and god himself shall be with them and be their god and god shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away rev 213 4 iii 1 a third scriptural mark of those who are born of god and the greatest of all is love even the love of god shed abroad in their hearts by the holy ghost which is given unto themrom 55 because they are sons god hath sent forth the spirit of his son in their hearts crying abba father gal 46 by this spirit continually looking up to god as their reconciled and loving father they cry to him for their daily bread for all things needful whether for their souls or bodies they continually pour out their hearts before him knowing they have the petitions which they ask of him 1 john 515 their delight is in him he is the joy of their heart their shield and their exceeding great reward the desire of their soul is toward him it is their meat and drink to do his will and they are satisfied as with marrow and fatness while their mouthpraiseth him with joyful lips psalm 635  2 and in this sense also every one wholoveth him that begat loveth him that is begotten of him 1 john 51 his spirit rejoiceth in god his saviour he loveth the lord jesus christ in sincerity he is so joined unto the lord as to be one spirit his soulhangeth upon him and chooseth him as altogether lovely the chiefest among ten thousand heknoweth he feeleth what that means my beloved is mine and i am his song 216 thou art fairer than the children of men full of grace are thy lips because god hath anointed thee for ever psalm 452 the necessary fruit of this love of god is the love of our neighbour of every soul which god hath made not excepting our enemies not excepting those who are now despitefully using and persecuting us  a love whereby we love every man as ourselves as we love our own souls nay our lord has expressed it still more strongly teaching us to love one another even as he hath loved us accordingly the commandment written in the hearts of all those that love god is no other than this as i have loved you so love ye one another now herein perceive we the love of god in that he laid down his life for us 1 john 316 we ought then as the apostle justly infers to lay down our lives for the brethren if we feel ourselves ready to do this then do we truly love our neighbour then we know that we have passed from death unto life because we thus love the brethren 1 john 314 hereby know we that we are born of god that we dwell in him and he in us because he hath given us of his loving spirit 1 john 413 for love is of god and every one that thus loveth is born of god andknoweth god 1 john 47 but some may possibly ask does not the apostle say this is the love of god that we keep his commandments 1 john 53 yea and this is the love of our neighbour also in the same sense as it is the love of god but what would you infer from hence that the keeping the outward commandments is all that is implied in loving god with all your heart with all your mind and soul and strength and in loving your neighbour as yourself that the love of god is not an affection of the soul but merely an outward service and that the love of our neighbour is not a disposition of heart but barely a course of outward works to mention so wild an interpretation of the apostles words is sufficiently to confute it the plain indisputable meaning of that text is  this is the sign or proof of the love of god of our keeping the first and great commandment to keep the rest of his commandments for true love if it be once shed abroad in our heart will constrain us so to do since whosoever loves god with all his heart cannot but serve him with all his strength a second fruit then of the love of god so far as it can be distinguished from it is universal obedience to him we love and conformity to his will obedience to all the commands of god internal and external obedience of the heart and of the life in every temper and in all manner of conversation and one of the tempers most obviously implied herein is the being zealous of good works the hungering and thirsting to do good in every possible kind unto all men the rejoicing to   spend and be spent for them for every child of man not looking for anyrecompence in this world but only in the resurrection of the just iv 1 thus have i plainly laid down those marks of the new birth which i find laid down in scripture thus doth god himself answer that weighty question what is it to be born of god such if the appeal be made to the oracles of god is every one that is born of the spirit this it is in the judgment of the spirit of god to be a son or a child of god it is so to believe in god through christ as not to commit sin and to enjoy at all times and in all places that peace of god whichpasseth all understanding it is so to hope in god through the son of his love as to have not only the testimony of a good conscience but also the spirit of god bearing witness with your spirits that ye are the children of god whence cannot but spring the rejoicing in him through whom ye have received the atonement it is so to love god who hath thus loved you as you never did love any creature so that ye are constrained to love all men as yourselves with a love not only ever burning in your hearts but flaming out in all your actions and conversations and making your whole life one labour of love one continued obedience to those commands be ye merciful as god is merciful be ye holy as i the lord am holy be ye perfect as your father which is in heaven is perfect 2 who then are ye that are thus born of god ye know the things which are given to you of god ye well know that ye are the children of god and can assure your hearts before him and every one of you who has observed these words cannot but feel and know of a truth whether at this hour answer to god and not to man you are thus a child of god or no the question is not what you was made in baptism do not evade but what are you now is the spirit of adoption now in your heart to your own heart let the appeal be made i ask not whether you was born of water and of the spirit but are you now the temple of the holy ghost whichdwelleth in you i allow you was circumcised with the circumcision of christ as st paul emphatically terms baptism but does the spirit of christ and of glory now rest upon you else your circumcision is become uncircumcision 3  say not then in your heart i was oncebaptized therefore i am now a child of god alas that consequence will by no means hold how many are thebaptized gluttons and drunkards the baptized liars and common swearers the baptized railers and evilspeakers the baptized whoremongers thieves extortioners what think you are these now the children of god verily i say unto you whosoever you are unto whom any one of the preceding characters belongs ye are of your father the devil and the works of your father ye do unto you i call in the name of him whom you crucify afresh and in his words to your circumcised predecessors ye serpents ye generation of vipers how can ye escape the damnation of hell how indeed except ye be born again for ye are now dead in trespasses and sins to say then that ye cannot be born again that there is no new birth but in baptism is to seal you all under damnation to consign you to hell without help without hope and perhaps some may think this just and right in their zeal for the lord of hosts they may say yea cut off the sinners theamalekites let these gibeonites be utterly destroyed they deserve no less no nor i nor you mine and your desert as well as theirs is hell and it is mere mercy free undeserved mercy that we are not now in unquenchable fire you will say but we are washed we were born again of water and of the spirit so were they this therefore hinders not at all but that ye may now be even as they know ye not that what is highly esteemed of men is an abomination in the sight of god come forth ye saints of the world ye that are honoured of men and see who will cast the first stone at them at these wretches not fit to live upon the earth these common harlots adulterers murderers only learn ye first what that meaneth he that hateth his brother is a murderer 1 john 315 he that looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart matt 528 ye adulterers and adulteresses know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with god james 44  verily verily i say unto you ye also must be born again except ye also be born again ye cannot see the kingdom of god lean no more on the staff of that broken reed that ye were born again in baptism who denies that ye were then made children of god and heirs of the kingdom of heaven but notwithstanding this ye are now children of the devil therefore ye must be born again and let not satan put it into your heart to cavil at a word when the thing is clear ye have heard what are the marks of the children of god all ye who have them not on your soulsbaptized or unbaptized   must needs receive them or without doubt ye will perish everlastingly and if ye have beenbaptized your only hope is this  that those who were made the children of god by baptism but are now the children of the devil may yet again receive power to become the sons of god that they may receive again what they have lost even the spirit of adoption crying in their hearts abba father amen lord jesus may every one whoprepareth his heart yet again to seek thy face receive again that spirit of adoption and cry out abba father let him now again have power so to believe in thy name as to become a child of god as to know and feel he hath redemption in thy blood even the forgiveness of sins and that he cannot commit sin because he is born of god let him be now begotten again unto a living hope so as to purify himself as thou art pure and because he is a son let the spirit of love and of glory rest upon him cleansing him from all filthiness of flesh and spirit and teaching him to perfect holiness in the fear of god   sermon 19 text from the 1872 edition the great privilege of those that are born of god whosoever is born of god doth not commit sin 1 john 39 it has been frequently supposed that the being born of god was all one with the being justified that the new birth and justification were only different expressions denoting the same thing it being certain on the one hand that whoever is justified is also born of god and on the other that whoever is born of god is also justified yea that both these gifts of god are given to every believer in one and the same moment in one point of time his sins are blotted out and he is born again of god but though it be allowed that justification and the new birth are in point of time inseparable from each other yet are they easily distinguished as being not the same but things of a widely different nature justification implies only a relative the new birth a real change god in justifying us does something for us in begetting us again he does the work in us the former changes our outward relation to god so that of enemies we become children by the latter our inmost souls are changed so that of sinners we become saints the one restores us to the favour the other to the image of god the one is the taking away the guilt the other the taking away the power of sin so that although they are joined together in point of time yet are they of wholly distinct natures the not discerning this the not observing the wide difference there is between being justified and being born again has occasioned exceeding great confusion of thought in many who have treated on this subject particularly when they have attempted to explain this great privilege of the children of god to show how whosoever is born of god doth not commit sin in order to apprehend this clearly it may be necessary first to consider what is the proper meaning of that expression whosoever is born of god and secondly to inquire in what sense he doth not commit sin i 1 first we are to consider what is the proper meaning of that expression whosoever is born of god and in general from all the passages of holy writ wherein this expression the being born of god occurs we may learn that it implies not barely the beingbaptized or any outward change whatever but a vast inward change a change wrought in the soul by the operation of the holy ghost a change in the whole manner of our existence for from the moment we are born of god we live in quite another manner than we did before we are as it were in another world the ground and reason of the expression is easy to be understood when we undergo this great change we may with much propriety be said to be born again because there is so near a resemblance between the circumstances of the natural and of the spiritual birth so that to consider the circumstances of the natural birth is the most easy way to understand the spiritual the child which is not yet born subsists indeed by the air as does everything which has life but feels it not nor any thing else unless in a very dull and imperfect manner it hears little if at all the organs of hearing being as yet closed up it sees nothing having its eyes fast shut and being surrounded with utter darkness there are it may be some faint beginnings of life when the time of its birth draws nigh and some motion consequent thereon whereby it is distinguished from a mere mass of matter but it has no senses all these avenues of the soul are hitherto quite shut up of consequence it has scarce any intercourse with this visible world nor any knowledge conception or idea of the things that occur therein the reason why he that is not yet born is wholly a stranger to the visible world is not because it is afar off it is very nigh it surrounds him on every side but partly because he has not those senses they are not yet opened in his soul whereby alone it is possible to hold commerce with the material world and partly because so thick a veil is cast between through which he can discern nothing   5 but no sooner is the child born into the world than he exists in a quite different manner he now feels the air with which he is surrounded and which pours into him from every side as fast as he alternately breathes it back to sustain the flame of life and hence springs a continual increase of strength of motion and of sensation all the bodily senses being nowawakened and furnished with their proper objects his eyes are now opened to perceive the light which silently flowing in upon them discovers not only itself but an infinite variety of things with which before he was wholly unacquainted his ears are unclosed and sounds rush in with endless diversity every sense is employed upon such objects as are peculiarly suitable to it and by these inlets the soul having an open intercourse with the visible world acquires more and more knowledge of sensible things of all the things which are under the sun  so it is with him that is born of god before that great change is wrought although he subsists by him in whom all that have life live and move and have their being yet he is not sensible of god he does not feel he has no inward consciousness of his presence he does not perceive that divine breath of life without which he cannot subsist a moment nor is he sensible of any of the things of god they make no impression upon his soul god is continually calling to him from on high but he heareth not his ears are shut so that the voice of the charmer is lost to him charm he never so wisely he seeth not the things of the spirit of god the eyes of his understanding being closed and utter darkness covering his whole soul surrounding him on every side it is true he may have some faint dawnings of life some small beginnings of spiritual motion but as yet he has no spiritual senses capable of discerning spiritual objects consequently he discerneth not the things of the spirit of god he cannot know them because they are spiritually discerned hence he has scarce any knowledge of the invisible world as he has scarce any intercourse with it not that it is afar off no he is in the midst of it it encompasses him round about the other world as we usually term it is not far from every one of us it is above and beneath and on every side only the natural man discerneth it not partly because he has no spiritual senses whereby alone we can discern the things of god partly because so thick a veil is interposed as he knows not how to penetrate  but when he is born of god born of the spirit how is the manner of his existence changed his whole soul is now sensible of god and he can say by sure experience thou art about my bed and about my path i feel thee in all my ways thoubesettest me behind and before andlayest thy hand upon me the spirit or breath of god is immediately inspired breathed into the newborn soul and the same breath which comes from returns to god as it is continually received by faith so it is continually rendered back by love by prayer and praise and thanksgiving love and praise and prayer being the breath of every soul which is truly born of god and by this new kind of spiritual respiration spiritual life is not only sustained but increased day by day together with spiritual strength and motion and sensation all the senses of the soul being now awake and capable of discerning spiritual good and evil the eyes of his understanding are now open and he seeth him that is invisible he sees what is the exceeding greatness of his power and of his love toward them that believe he sees that god is merciful to him a sinner that he is reconciled through the son of his love he clearly perceives both the pardoning love of god and all his exceeding great and precious promises god who commanded the light to shine out of the darkness hath shined and doth shine in his heart to enlighten him with the knowledge of the glory of god in the face of jesus christ all the darkness is now passed away and he abides in the light of gods countenance his ears are now opened and the voice of god no longer calls in vain he hears and obeys the heavenly calling he knows the voice of his shepherd all his spiritual senses being nowawakened he has a clear intercourse with the invisible world and hence he knows more and more of the things which before it could not enter into his heart to conceive he now knows what the peace of god is what is joy in the holy ghost what the love of god which is shed abroad in the heart of them that believe in him through christ jesus thus the veil being removed which before interrupted the light   and voice the knowledge and love of god he who is born of the spirit dwelling in lovedwelleth in god and god in him ii 1 having considered the meaning of that expression whosoever is born of god it remains in the second place to inquire in what sense he doth not commit sin now one who is so born of god as hath been above described who continually receives into his soul the breath of life from god the gracious influence of his spirit and continually renders it back one who thus believes and loves who by faith perceives the continualactings of god upon his spirit and by a kind of spiritual reaction returns the grace he receives in unceasing love and praise and prayer not only doth not commit sin while he thuskeepeth himself but so long as this seed remaineth in him he cannot sin because he is born of god by sin i here understand outward sin according to the plain common acceptation of the word an actual voluntary transgression of the law of the revealed written law of god of any commandment of god acknowledged to be such at the time that it is transgressed but whosoever is born of god while he abideth in faith and love and in the spirit of prayer and thanksgiving not only doth not but cannot thus commit sin so long as he thus believeth in god through christ and loves him and is pouring out his heart before him he cannot voluntarily transgress any command of god either by speaking or acting what he knows god hath forbidden so long that seed whichremaineth in him that loving praying thankful faith compels him to refrain from whatsoever he knows to be an abomination in the sight of god but here a difficulty will immediately occur and one that to many has appeared insuperable and induced them to deny the plain assertion of the apostle and give up the privilege of the children of god it is plain in fact that those whom we cannot deny to have been truly born of god the spirit of god having given us in his word this infallible testimony concerning them nevertheless not only could but did commit sin even gross outward sin they did transgress the plain known laws of god speaking or acting what they knew he had forbidden thus david was unquestionably born of god or ever he was anointed king over israel he knew in whom he had believed he was strong in faith giving glory to god the lord saith he is my shepherd therefore can i lack nothing he shall feed me in green pastures and lead me forth beside the waters of comfort yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil for thou art with me psalm 23 1 c he was filled with love such as often constrained him to cry out i will love thee o lord my strength the lord is my stony rock and my defence the horn also of my salvation and my refuge psalm 281 he was a man of prayer pouring out his soul before god in all circumstances of life and abundant in praises and thanksgiving thy praise saith he shall be ever in my mouth psalm 341 thou art my god and i will thank thee thou art my god and i will praise thee psalm 11828 and yet such a child of god could and did commit sin yea the horrid sins of adultery and murder and even after the holy ghost was more largely given after life and immortality were brought to light by the gospel we want not instances of the same melancholy kind which were also doubtless written for our instruction thus he who probably from his selling all that he had and bringing the price for the relief of his poor brethren was by the apostles themselves surnamedbarnabas that is the son of consolation acts 436 37 who was so honoured atantioch as to be selected withsaul out of all the disciples to carry their relief unto the brethren injudea acts 1129 30 this barnabas who at his return from judea was by the peculiar direction of the holy ghost solemnly separated from the other prophets and teachers for the workwhereunto god had called him acts 1314 even to accompany the great apostle among the gentiles and to be his fellowlabourer in every place  nevertheless was afterward so sharp acts 1535 39 in his contention with st paul because he thought it not good to take with them john in his visiting the brethren a second time who had departed from them from pamphylia and went not with them to the work that he himself also departed from the work that he took john and sailed unto cyprus acts 1539 forsaking him to whom he had been in so immediate a manner joined by the holy ghost   an instance more astonishing than both these is given by st paul in his epistle to thegalatians when peter the aged the zealous the first of the apostles one of the three most highly favoured by his lord was come toantioch i withstood him to the face because he was to be blamed for before that certain came from james he did eat with the gentiles  the heathens converted to the christian faith as having been peculiarly taught of god that he should not call any man common or unclean acts 1028 but when they were come he separated himself fearing them which were of the circumcision and the other jews dissembled likewise with him insomuch thatbarnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation but when i saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel i said unto peter before them all if thou being a jewlivest after the manner of the gentiles  not regarding the ceremonial law ofmoses  why compellest thou the gentiles to live as do the jews gal 211 c here is also plain undeniable sin committed by one who was undoubtedly born of god but how can this be reconciled with the assertion of st john if taken in the obvious literal meaning that whosoever is born of god doth not commit sin i answer what has been long observed is this so long as he that is born of godkeepeth himself which he is able to do by the grace of god the wicked onetoucheth him not but if he keepeth not himself if he abide not in the faith he may commit sin even as another man it is easy therefore to understand how any of these children of god might be moved from his own steadfastness and yet the great truth of god declared by the apostle remain steadfast and unshaken he did not keep himself by that grace of god which was sufficient for him he fell step by step first into negative inward sin not stirring up the gift of god which was in him not watching unto prayer not pressing on to the mark of the prize of his high calling then into positive inward sin inclining to wickedness with his heart giving way to some evil desire or temper next he lost his faith his sight of a pardoning god and consequently his love of god and being then weak and like another man he was capable of committing even outward sin 8 to explain this by a particular instance david was born of god and saw god by faith he loved god in sincerity he could truly say whom have i in heaven but thee and there is none upon earth neither person nor thing that i desire in comparison of thee but still there remained in his heart that corruption of nature which is the seed of all evil he was walking upon the roof of his house 2 sam 112 probably praising the god whom his soul loved when he looked down and sawbathsheba he felt a temptation a thought which tended to evil the spirit of god did not fail to convince him of this he doubtless heard and knew the warning voice but he yielded in some measure to the thought and the temptation began to prevail over him hereby his spirit was sullied he saw god still but it was more dimly than before he loved god still but not in the same degree not with the same strength and ardour of affection yet god checked him again though his spirit was grieved and his voice though fainter and fainter still whispered sin lieth at the door look unto me and be thou saved but he would not hear he looked again not unto god but unto the forbidden object till nature was superior to grace and kindled lust in his soul the eye of his mind was now closed again and god vanished out of his sight faith the divine supernatural intercourse with god and the love of god ceased together he then rushed on as a horse into the battle and knowingly committed the outward sin 9 you see the unquestionable progress from grace to sin thus it goes on from step to step 1 the divine seed of loving conquering faith remains in him that is born of god hekeepeth himself by the grace of god and cannot commit sin 2 a temptation arises whether from the world the flesh or the devil it matters not 3 the spirit of god gives him warning that sin is near and bids him more abundantly watch unto prayer 4 he gives way in some degree to the temptation which now begins to grow pleasing to him 5 the holy spirit is grieved his faith is weakened and his love of god grows cold 6 the spirit reproves him more sharply and saith this is the way walk thou in it 7 he turns away from the painful voice of god and listens to the pleasing voice of the tempter 8 evil desire begins and spreads in his soul till faith and love vanish away he is then capable of committing outward sin the power of the lord being departed from him   10 to explain this by another instance the apostle peter was full of faith and of the holy ghost and hereby keeping himself he had a conscience void of offence toward god and toward man walking thus in simplicity and godly sincerity before that certain came from james he did eat with the gentiles knowing that what god had cleansed was not common or unclean but when they were come a temptation arose in his heart to fear those of the circumcision the jewish converts who were zealous for circumcision and the other rites of the mosaic law and regard the favour and praise of these men more than the praise of god he was warned by the spirit that sin was near nevertheless he yielded to it in some degree even to sinful fear of man and his faith and love were proportionably weakened god reproved him again for giving place to the devil yet he would not hearken to the voice of his shepherd but gave himself up to that slavish fear and thereby quenched the spirit then god disappeared and faith and love being extinct he committed the outward sin walking not uprightly not according to the truth of the gospel he separated himself from his christian brethren and by his evil example if not advice also compelled even the gentiles to live after the manner of the jews to entangle themselves again with that yoke of bondage from which christ had set them free thus it is unquestionably true that he who is born of god keeping himself doth not cannot commit sin and yet if he keepeth not himself he may commit all manner of sin with greediness iii 1 from the preceding considerations we may learn first to give a clear and incontestable answer to a question which has frequently perplexed many who were sincere of heart does sin precede or follow the loss of faith does a child of god first commit sin and thereby lose his faith or does he lose his faith first before he can commit sin i answer some sin of omission at least must necessarily precede the loss of faith some inward sin but the loss of faith must precede the committing outward sin the more any believer examines his own heart the more will he be convinced of this that faith working by love excludes both inward and outward sin from a soul watching unto prayer that nevertheless we are even then liable to temptation particularly to the sin that did easily beset us that if the loving eye of the soul be steadily fixed on god the temptation soon vanishes away but if not if we are exelkomenoi as the apostle james speaks james 114 drawn out of god by our own desire and deleazomenoi caught by the bait of present or promised pleasure then that desire conceived in us brings forth sin and having by that inward sin destroyed our faith it casts us headlong into the snare of the devil so that we may commit any outward sin whatever from what has been said we may learn secondly what the life of god in the soul of a believer is wherein it properly consists and what is immediately and necessarily implied therein it immediately and necessarily implies the continual inspiration of gods holy spirit gods breathing into the soul and the souls breathing back what it first receives from god a continual action of god upon the soul and a reaction of the soul upon god an unceasing presence of god the loving pardoning god manifested to the heart and perceived by faith and an unceasing return of love praise and prayer offering up all the thoughts of our hearts all the words of our tongues all the works of our hands all our body soul and spirit to be a holy sacrifice acceptable unto god in christ jesus and hence we may thirdly infer the absolute necessity of this reaction of the soul whatsoever it be called in order to the continuance of the divine life therein for it plainly appears god does not continue to act upon the soul unless the soul reacts upon god he prevents us indeed with the blessings of his goodness he first loves us and manifests himself unto us while we are yet afar off he calls us to himself and shines upon our hearts but if we do not then love him who first loved us if we will not hearken to his voice if we turn our eye away from him and will not attend to the light which he pours upon us his spirit will not always strive he will gradually withdraw and leave us to   the darkness of our own hearts he will not continue to breathe into our soul unless our soul breathes toward him again unless our love and prayer and thanksgiving return to him a sacrifice wherewith he is well pleased 4 let us learn lastly to follow that direction of the great apostle be not highminded but fear let us fear sin more than death or hell let us have a jealous though not painful fear lest we should lean to our own deceitful hearts let him thatstandeth take heed lest he fall even he who now standeth fast in the grace of god in the faith that overcometh the world may nevertheless fall into inward sin and thereby make shipwreck of his faith and how easily then will outward sin regain its dominion over him thou therefore o man of god watch always that thou mayest always hear the voice of god watch that thou mayest pray without ceasing at all times and in all places pouring out thy heart before him so shalt thou always believe and always love and never commit sin   sermon 20 the lord our righteousness preached at the chapel in weststreet seven dials on sunday nov 24 1765 this is his name whereby he shall be called the lord our righteousness jer 236 how dreadful and how innumerable are the contests which have arisen about religion and not only among the children of this world among those who knew not what true religion was but even among the children of god those who had experienced the kingdom of god within them who had tasted of righteousness and peace and joy in the holy ghost how many of these in all ages instead of joining together against the common enemy have turned their weapons against each other and so not only wasted their precious time but hurt one anothers spirits weakened each others hands and so hindered the great work of their common master how many of the weak have hereby been offended  how many of the lame turned out of the way how many sinners confirmed in their disregard of all religion and their contempt of those that profess it and how many of the excellent ones upon earth have been constrained to weep in secret places what would not every lover of god and his neighbour do what would he not suffer to remedy this sore evil to remove contention from the children of god to restore or preserve peace among them what but a good conscience would he think too dear to part with in order to promote this valuable end and suppose we cannot make these wars to cease in all the world suppose we cannot reconcile all the children of god to each other however let each do what he can let him contribute if it be but two mites toward it happy are they who are able in any degree to promote peace and goodwill among men especially among good men among those that are all listed under the banner of the prince of peace and are therefore peculiarly engaged as much as lies in them to live peaceably with all men it would be a considerable step toward this glorious end if we could bring good men to understand one another abundance of disputes arise purely from the want of this from mere misapprehension frequently neither of the contending parties understands what his opponent means whence it follows that each violently attacks the other while there is no real difference between them and yet it is not always an easy matter to convince them of this particularly when their passions are moved it is then attended with the utmost difficulty however it is not impossible especially when we attempt it not trusting in ourselves but having all our dependence upon him with whom all things are possible how soon is he able to disperse the cloud to shine upon their hearts and to enable them both to understand each other and the truth as it is in jesus one very considerable article of this truth is contained in the words above recited this is his name whereby he shall be called the lord our righteousness a truth this which enters deep into the nature of christianity and in a manner supports the whole frame of it of this undoubtedly may be affirmed what luther affirms of a truth closely connected with it it is articulus stantis vel cadentis ecclesiae the christian church stands or falls with it it is certainly the pillar and ground of that faith of which alone cometh salvation of that catholic or universal faith which is found in all the children of god and which unless a man keep whole and undefiled without doubt he shall perish everlastingly might not one therefore reasonably expect that however they differed in others all those who name the name of christ should agree in this point but how far is this from being the case there is scarce any wherein they are so little agreed wherein those who all profess to follow christ seem so widely and irreconcilably to differ i say seem because i amthroughly convinced that many of them only seem to differ the disagreement is more in words than in sentiments they are much nearer in   judgment than in language and a wide difference in language there certainly is not only between protestants and papists but between protestant and protestant yea even between those who all believe justification by faith who agree as well in this as every other fundamental doctrine of the gospel 6 but if the difference be more in opinion than real experience and more in expression than in opinion how can it be that even the children of god should so vehemently contend with each other on the point several reasons may be assigned for this the chief is their not understanding one another joined with too keen an attachment to their opinions and particular modes of expression in order to remove this at least in some measure in order to our understanding one another on this head i shall by the help of god endeavour to show i what is the righteousness of christ ii when and in what sense it is imputed to us and conclude with a short and plain application and i what is the righteousness of christ it is twofold either his divine or his human righteousness 1 his divine righteousness belongs to his divine nature as he is ho on he that existeth over all god blessed for ever the supreme the eternal equal with the father as touching hisgodhead though inferior to the father as touching his manhood now this is his eternal essential immutable holiness his infinite justice mercy and truth in all which he and the father are one but i do not apprehend that the divine righteousness of christ is immediately concerned in the present question i believe few if any do now contend for the imputation of this righteousness to us whoever believes the doctrine of imputation understands it chiefly if not solely of his human righteousness the human righteousness of christ belongs to him in his human nature as he is the mediator between god and man the man christ jesus this is either internal or external his internal righteousness is the image of god stamped on every power and faculty of his soul it is a copy of his divine righteousness as far as it can be imparted to a human spirit it is a transcript of the divine purity the divine justice mercy and truth it includes love reverence resignation to his father humility meekness gentleness love to lost mankind and every other holy and heavenly temper and all these in the highest degree without any defect or mixture of unholiness it was the least part of his external righteousness that he did nothing amiss that he knew no outward sin of any kind neither was guile found in his mouth that he never spoke one improper word nor did one improper action thus far it is only a negative righteousness though such an one as never did nor ever can belong to anyone that is born of a woman save himself alone but even his outward righteousness was positive too he did all things well in every word of his tongue in every work of his hands he did precisely the will of him that sent him in the whole course of his life he did the will of god on earth as the angels do it in heaven all he acted and spoke was exactly right in every circumstance the whole and every part of his obediencewas complete he fulfilled all righteousness  but his obedience implied more than all this it implied not only doing but suffering suffering the whole will of god from the time he came into the world till he bore our sins in his own body upon the tree yea till having made a full atonement for them he bowed his head and gave up the ghost this is usually termed the passive righteousness of christ the former his active righteousness but as the active and passive righteousness of christ were never in fact separated from each other so we never need separate them at all either in speaking or even in thinking and it is with regard to both these conjointly that jesus is called the lord our righteousness   ii but when is it that any of us may truly say the lord our righteousness in other words when is it that the righteousness of christ is imputed to us and in what sense is it imputed 1 look through all the world and all the men therein are either believers or unbelievers the first thing then which admits of no dispute among reasonable men is this to all believers the righteousness of christ is imputed to unbelievers it is not but when is it imputed when they believe in that very hour the righteousness of christ is theirs it is imputed to every one that believes as soon as he believes faith and the righteousness of christ are inseparable for if he believes according to scripture he believes in the righteousness of christ there is no true faith that is justifying faith which hath not the righteousness of christ for its object it is true believers may not all speak alike they may not all use the same language it is not to be expected that they should we cannot reasonably require it of them a thousand circumstances may cause them to vary from each other in the manner of expressing themselves but a difference of expression does nor necessarily imply a difference of sentiment different persons may use different expressions and yet mean the same thing nothing is more common than this although we seldom make sufficient allowance for it nay it is not easy for the same persons when they speak of the same thing at a considerable distance of time to use exactly the same expressions even though they retain the same sentiments how then can we be rigorous in requiring others to use just the same expressions with us  we may go a step farther yet men may differ from us in their opinions as well as their expressions and nevertheless be partakers with us of the same precious faith it is possible they may not have a distinct apprehension of the very blessing which they enjoy their ideas may not be so clear and yet their experience may be as sound as ours there is a wide difference between the natural faculties of men their understandings in particular and that difference is exceedingly increased by the manner of their education indeed this alone may occasion an inconceivable difference in their opinions of various kinds and why not upon this head as well as on any other but still though their opinions as well as expressions may be confused and inaccurate their hearts may cleave to god through the son of his love and be truly interested in his righteousness let us then make all that allowance to others which were we in their place we would desire for ourselves who is ignorant to touch again on that circumstance only of the amazing power of education and who that knows it can expect suppose a member of the church of rome either to think or speak clearly on this subject and yet if we had heard even dyingbellarmine cry out  when he was asked unto which of the saints wilt thou turn  fidere meritis christi tutissimum it is safest to trust in the merits of christ would we have affirmed that not withstanding his wrong opinions he had no share in his righteousness but in what sense is this righteousness imputed to believers in this all believers are forgiven and accepted not for the sake of anything in them or of anything that ever was that is or ever can be done by them but wholly and solely for the sake of what christ hath done and suffered for them i say again not for the sake of anything in them or done by them of their own righteousness or works not for works of righteousness which we have done but of his own mercy he saved us by grace ye are saved through faith  not of works lest any man should boast but wholly and solely for the sake of what christ hath done and suffered for us we are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in jesus christ and this is not only the means of our obtaining the favour of god but of our continuing therein it is thus we come to god at first it is by the same we come unto him ever after we walk in one and the same new and living way till our spirit returns to god and this is the doctrine which i have constantly believed and taught for near eight and twenty years this i published to all the world in the year 1738 and ten or twelve times since in those words and many others to the same effect extracted from the homilies of our church  these things must necessarily go together in our justification upon gods part his great mercy and grace upon christs part the satisfaction of gods justice and on our part faith in the merits of christ so that the grace of god doth not shut out the righteousness of god in our justification but onlyshutteth out the righteousness of man as to deserving our justification that we are justified by faith alone is   spoken to take away clearly all merit of our works and wholly to ascribe the merit and deserving of our justification to christ only our justification comes freely of the mere mercy of god for whereas all the world was not able to pay any part toward our ransom it pleased him without any of our deserving to prepare for us christs body and blood whereby our ransom might be paid and his justice satisfied christ therefore is now the righteousness of all them that truly believe in him 7 the hymns published a year or two after this and since republished several times a clear testimony that my judgment was still the same speak full to the same purpose to cite all the passages to this effect would be to transcribe a great part of the volumes take one for all which was reprinted seven years ago five years ago two years ago and some months since  jesu thy blood and righteousness my beauty are my glorious dress midst flaming worlds in these arrayd with joy shall i lift up my head the whole hymn expresses the same sentiment from the beginning to the end in the sermon on justification published nineteen and again seven or eight years ago i express the same thing in these words p 55 in consideration of this  that the son of god hath tasted death for every man god hath now reconciled the world unto himself not imputing to them their former trespasses so that for the sake of his wellbeloved son of what he hath done and suffered for us god now vouchsafes on one only condition which himself also enables us to perform both to remit the punishment due to our sins to reinstate us in his favour and to restore our dead souls to spiritual life as the earnest of life eternal this is more largely and particularly expressed in the treatise on justification which i published last year if we take the phrase of imputing christs righteousness for the bestowing as it were the righteousness of christ including his obedience as well passive as active in the return of it that is in the privileges blessings and benefits purchased it so a believer may be said to be justified by the righteousness of christ imputed the meaning is god justifies the believer for the sake of christs righteousness and not for any righteousness of his own socalvin institut 12 c17 christ by his obedience procured and merited for us grace or favour with god the father again christ by his obedience procured or purchased righteousness for us and yet again all such expressions as these  that we are justified by the grace of god that christ is our righteousness that righteousness was procured for us by the death and resurrection of christ import the same thing namely that the righteousness of christ both his active and passive righteousness is the meritorious cause of our justification and has procured for us at gods hand that upon our believing we should be accounted righteous by him page 5 but perhaps some will object nay but you affirm that faith is imputed to us for righteousness st paul affirms this over and over therefore i affirm it too faith is imputed for righteousness to every believer namely faith in the righteousness of christ but this is exactly the same thing which has been said before for by that expression i mean neither more nor less than that we are justified by faith not by works or that every believer is forgiven and accepted merely for the sake of what christ has done and suffered but is not a believer invested or clothed with the righteousness of christ undoubtedly he is and accordingly the words aboverecited are the language of every believing heart jesu thy blood and righteousness my beauty are my glorious dress that is for the sake of thy active and passive righteousness i am forgiven and accepted of god   but must not we put off the filthy rags of our own righteousness before we can put on the spotless righteousness of christ certainly we must that is in plain terms we must repent before we can believe the gospel we must be cut off from dependence upon ourselves before we can truly depend upon christ we must cast away all confidence in our own righteousness or we cannot have a true confidence in his till we are delivered from trusting in anything that we do we cannothroughly trust in what he has done and suffered first we receive the sentence of death in ourselves then we trust in him that lived and died for us but do not you believe inherent righteousness yes in its proper place not as the ground of our acceptance with god but as the fruit of it not in the place of imputed righteousness but as consequent upon it that is i believe god implants righteousness in every one to whom he has imputed it i believe jesus christ is made of god unto us sanctification as well as righteousness or that god sanctifies as well as justifies all them that believe in him they to whom the righteousness of christ is imputed are made righteous by the spirit of christ are renewed in the image of god after the likeness wherein they were created in righteousness and true holiness but do not you put faith in the room of christ or of his righteousness by no means i take particular care to put each of these in its proper place the righteousness of christ is the whole and sole foundation of all our hope it is by faith that the holy ghost enables us to build upon this foundation god gives this faith in that moment we are accepted of god and yet not for the sake of that faith but of what christ has done and suffered for us you see each of these has its proper place and neither clashes with the other we believe we love we endeavour to walk in all the commandments of the lord blameless yet while thus we bestow our moments below ourselves we forsake and refuge in jesuss righteousness take his passion alone the foundation we own and pardon we claim and eternal redemption in jesuss name i therefore no more deny the righteousness of christ than i deny thegodhead of christ and a man may full as justly charge me with denying the one as the other neither do i deny imputed righteousness this is another unkind and unjust accusation i always did and do still continually affirm that the righteousness of christ is imputed to every believer but who deny it why all infidels whether baptized or unbaptized all who affirm the glorious gospel of our lord jesus christ to be a cunningly devised fable allsocinians and arians all who deny the supremegodhead of the lord that bought them they of consequence deny his divine righteousness as they suppose him to be a mere creature and they deny his human righteousness as imputed to any man seeing they believe everyone is accepted for his own righteousness the human righteousness of christ at least the imputation of it as the whole and sole meritorious cause of the justification of a sinner before god is likewise denied by the members of the church of rome by all of them who are true to the principles of their own church but undoubtedly there are many among them whose experience goes beyond their principles who though they are far from expressing themselves justly yet feel what they know not how to express yea although their conceptions of this great truth be as crude as their expressions yet with their heart they is believe they rest on christ alone both unto present and eternal salvation   with these we may rank those even in the reformed churches who are usually termed mystics one of the chief of these in the present century at least in england was mr law it is well known that he absolutely and zealously denied the imputation of the righteousness of christ as zealously as robert barclay who scruples not to say imputed righteousness  imputed nonsense the body of the people known by the name of quakers espouse the same sentiment nay the generality of those who profess themselves members of the church of england are either totally ignorant of the matter and know nothing about imputed righteousness or deny this and justification by faith together as destructive of good works to these we may add a considerable number of the people vulgarly styled anabaptists together with thousands ofpresbyterians and independents lately enlightened by the writings of dr taylor on the last i am not called to pass any sentence i leave them to him that made them but will anyone dare to affirm that all mystics such as was mr law in particular all quakers all presbyterians or independents and all members of the church of england who are not clear in their opinions or expressions are void of all christian experience  that consequently they are all in a state of damnation without hope without god in the world however confused their ideas may be however improper their language may there not be many of them whose heart is right toward god and who effectually know the lord our righteousness but blessed be god we are not among those who are so dark in their conceptions and expressions we no more deny the phrase than the thing but we are unwilling to obtrude it on other men let them use either this or such other expressions as they judge to be more exactly scriptural provided their heart rests only on what christ hath done and suffered for pardon grace and glory i cannot express this better than in mr herveys words worthy to be wrote in letters of gold we are not solicitous as to any particular set of phrases only let men be humbled as repenting criminals at christs feet let them rely as devoted pensioners on his merits and they are undoubtedly in the way to a blessed immortality  is there any need is there any possibility of saying more let us only abide by this declaration and all the contention about this or that particular phrase is torn up by the roots keep to this  all who are humbled as repenting criminals at christs feet and rely as devoted pensioners on his merits are in the way to a blessed immortality and what room for dispute who denies this do we not all meet on this ground what then shall we wrangle about a man of peace here proposes terms of accommodation to all the contending parties we desire no better we accept of the terms we subscribe to them with heart and hand whoever refuses so to do set a mark upon that man he is an enemy of peace and a troubler of israel a disturber of the church of god in the meantime what we are afraid of is this  lest any should use the phrase the righteousness of christ or the righteousness of christ is imputed to me as a cover for his unrighteousness we have known this done a thousand times a man has been reproved suppose for drunkenness o said he i pretend to no righteousness of my own christ is my righteousness another has been told that the extortioner the unjust shall not inherit the kingdom of god he replies with all assurance i am unjust in myself but i have a spotless righteousness in christ and thus though a man be as far from the practice as from the tempers of a christian though he neither has the mind which was in christ nor in any respect walks as he walked yet he has armour of proof against all conviction in what he calls the righteousness of christ it is the seeing so many deplorable instances of this kind which makes us sparing in the use of these expressions and i cannot but call upon all of you who use them frequently and beseech you in the name of god our saviour whose you are and whom you serve earnestly to guard all that hear you against this accursed abuse of them o warn them it may be they will hear your voice against continuing in sin that grace may abound warn them against making christ the minister of sin against making void that solemn decree of god without holiness no man shall see the lord by a vain imagination of being holy in christ o warn them that if they remain unrighteous the righteousness of christ will profit them nothing cry aloud is there not a cause that for this very end the righteousness of christ is imputed to us that the righteousness of the law may be fulfilled in us and that we may live soberly religiously and godly in this present world   it remains only to make a short and plain application and first i would address myself to you who violently oppose these expressions and are ready to condemn all that use them as antinomians but is   not this bending the bow too much the other way why should you condemn all who do not speak just as you do why should you quarrel with them for using the phrases they like any more than they with you for taking the same liberty or if they do quarrel with you upon that account do not imitate the bigotry which you blame at least allow them the liberty which they ought to allow you and why should you be angry at an expression o it has been abused and what expression has not however the abuse may be removed and at the same time the use remain above all be sure to retain the important sense which is couched under that expression all the blessings i enjoy all i hope for in time and in eternity are given wholly and solely for the sake of what christ has done and suffered for me  i would secondly add a few words to you who are fond of these expressions and permit me to ask do not i allow enough what can any reasonable man desire more i allow the whole sense which you contend for that we have every blessing through the righteousness of god our saviour i allow you to use whatever expressions you choose and that a thousand times over only guarding them against that dreadful abuse which you are as deeply concerned to prevent as i am i myself frequently use the expression in question  imputed righteousness and often put this and the like expressions into the mouth of a whole congregation but allow me liberty of conscience herein allow me the right of private judgment allow me to use it just as often as i judge it preferable to any other expression and be not angry with me if i cannot judge it proper to use any one expression every two minutes you may if you please but do not condemn me because i do not do not for this represent me as a papist or an enemy to the righteousness of christ bear with me as i do with you else how shall we fulfil the law of christ do not maketragical outcries as though i were subverting the very foundations of christianity whoever does this does me much wrong the lord lay it not to his charge i lay and have done for many years the very same foundation with you and indeed other foundation can no man lay than that which is laid even jesus christ i build inward and outward holiness thereon as you do even by faith do not therefore suffer any distaste or unkindness no nor any shyness or coldness in your heart if there were a difference of opinion where is our religion if we cannot think and let think what hinders but you may forgive me as easily as i may forgive you how much more when there is only a difference of expression nay hardly so much as that all the dispute being only whether a particular mode of expression shall be used more or less frequently surely we must earnestly desire to contend with one another before we can make this a bone of contention o let us not any more for such very trifles as these give our common enemies room to blaspheme rather let us at length cut off occasion for them that seek occasion let us at length o why was it not done before join hearts and hands in the service of our great master as we have one lord one faith one hope of our calling let us all strengthen each others hands in god and with one heart and one mouth declare to all mankind the lord our righteousness   sermon 21 text of the 1872 edition upon our lords sermon on the mount discourse 1 and seeing the multitudes he went up into a mountain and when he was set his disciples came unto him and he opened his mouth and taught them saying blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted matt 51 4 our lord had now gone about all galilee matt 423 beginning at the time when john was cast into prison matt 412 not only teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom but likewise healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people it was a natural consequence of this that there followed him great multitudes from galilee and from decapolis and from jerusalem and fromjudea and from the region beyond jordan matt 425 and seeing the multitudes whom no synagogue could contain even had there been any at hand he went up into a mountain where there was room for all that came unto him from every quarter and when he was set as the manner of the jews was his disciples came unto him and he opened his mouth an expression denoting the beginning of a solemn discourse and taught them saying  let us observe who it is that is here speaking that we may take heed how we hear it is the lord of heaven and earth the creator of all who as such has a right to dispose of all his creatures the lord our governor whose kingdom is from everlasting andruleth over all the great lawgiver who can well enforce all his laws being able to save and to destroy yea to punish with everlasting destruction from his presence and from the glory of his power it is the eternal wisdom of the father who knoweth whereof we are made and understands our inmost frame who knows how we stand related to god to one another to every creature which god hath made and consequently how to adapt every law he prescribes to all the circumstances wherein he hath placed us it is he who is loving unto every man whose mercy is over all his works the god of love who having emptied himself of his eternal glory is come forth from his father to declare his will to the children of men and then goeth again to the father who is sent of god to open the eyes of the blind and to give light to them that sit in darkness it is the great prophet of the lord concerning whom god had solemnly declared long ago whosoever will not hearken unto my words which he shall speak in my name i will require it of him deut 1819 or as the apostle expresses it every soul which will not hear that prophet shall be destroyed from among the people acts 323 and what is it which he is teaching the son of god who came from heaven is here showing us the way to heaven to the place which he hath prepared for us the glory he had before the world began he is teaching us the true way to life everlasting the royal way which leads to the kingdom and the only true way  for there is none besides all other paths lead to destruction from the character of the speaker we are well assured that he hath declared the full and perfect will of god he hath uttered not one tittle too much  nothing more than he had received of the father nor too little  he hath not shunned to declare the whole counsel of god much less hath he uttered anything wrong anything contrary to the will of him that sent him all his words are true and right concerning all things and shall stand fast for ever and ever and we may easily remark that in explaining and confirming these faithful and true sayings he takes care to refute not only the mistakes of the scribes andpharisees which then were the false comments whereby the jewish teachers of that age had perverted the word of god but all the practical mistakes that are inconsistent with salvation which should ever arise in the christian church all the comments whereby the christian teachers so called of any age or nation should pervert the word of god and teach unwary souls to seek death in the error of their life   4 and hence we are naturally led to observe whom it is that he is here teaching not the apostles alone if so he had no need to have gone up into the mountain a room in the house of matthew or any of his disciples would have contained the twelve nor does it in anywise appear that the disciples who came unto him were the twelve only hoimathetai autou without any force put upon the expression may be understood of all who desired to learn of him but to put this out of all question to make it undeniably plain that where it is said he opened his mouth and taught them the word them includes all the multitudes who went up with him into the mountain we need only observe the concluding verses of the seventh chapter and it came to pass when jesus had ended these sayings the multitudes hoi ochloi were astonished at his doctrine or teaching for he taught them the multitudes as one having authority and not as the scribes matt 72829 nor was it only those multitudes who were with him on the mount to whom he now taught the way of salvation but all the children of men the whole race of mankind the children that were yet unborn all the generations to come even to the end of the world who should ever hear the words of this life 5 and this all men allow with regard to some parts of the ensuing discourse no man for instance denies that what is said of poverty of spirit relates to all mankind but many have supposed that other parts concerned only the apostles or the first christians or the ministers of christ and were never designed for the generality of men who consequently have nothing at all to do with them but may we not justly inquire who told them this that some parts of this discourse concerned only the apostles or the christians of the apostolic age or the ministers of christ bare assertions are not a sufficient proof to establish a point of so great importance has then our lord himself taught us that some parts of his discourse do not concern all mankind without doubt had it been so he would have told us he could not have omitted so necessary an information but has he told us so where in the discourse itself no here is not the least intimation of it has he said so elsewhere in any other of his discourses not one word so much as glancing this way can we find in anything he ever spoke either to the multitudes or to his disciples has any one of the apostles or other inspired writers left such an instruction upon record no such thing no assertion of this kind is to be found in all the oracles of god who then are the men who are so much wiser than god  wise so far above that is written  6 perhaps they will say that the reason of the thing requires such a restriction to be made if it does it must be on one of these two accounts because without such a restriction the discourse would either be apparently absurd or would contradict some otherscripture but this is not the case it will plainly appear when we come to examine the several particulars that there is no absurdity at all in applying all which our lord hath here delivered to all mankind neither will it infer any contradiction to anything else he has delivered nor to any otherscripture whatever nay it will farther appear that either all the parts of this discourse are to be applied to men in general or no part seeing they are all connected together all joined as the stones in an arch of which you cannot take one away without destroying the whole fabric  we may lastly observe how our lord teaches here and surely as at all times so particularly at this he speaks as never man spake not as the holy men of old although they also spoke as they were moved by the holy ghost not as peter or james or john or paul they were indeed wise masterbuilders in his church but still in this in the degrees of heavenly wisdom the servant is not as his lord no nor even as himself at any other time or on any other occasion it does not appear that it was ever his design at any other time or place to lay down at once the whole plan of his religion to give us a full prospect of christianity to describe at large the nature of that holiness without which no man shall see the lord particular branches of this he has indeed described on a thousand different occasions but never besides here did he give of set purpose a general view of the whole nay we have nothing else of this kind in all the bible unless one should except that short sketch of holiness delivered by god in those ten words or commandments tomoses on mount sinai but even here how wide a difference is there between one and the other even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect by reason of the glory thatexcelleth 2 cor 310 above all with what amazing love does the son of god here reveal his fathers will to man he does not bring us again to the mount that burned with fire nor unto blackness and darkness and   tempest he does not speak as when he thundered out of heaven when the highest gave his thunder hailstones and coals of fire he now addresses us with his still small voice  blessed or happy are the poor in spirit happy are the mourners the meek those that hunger after righteousness the merciful the pure in heart happy in the end and in the way happy in this life and in life everlasting as if he had said who is he thatlusteth to live and would fain see good days behold i show you the thing which your soullongeth for see the way you have so long sought in vain the way of pleasantness the path to calm joyous peace to heaven below and heaven above at the same time with what authority does he teach well might they say not as the scribes observe the manner but it cannot be expressed in words the air with which he speaks not as moses the servant of god not asabraham his friend not as any of the prophets nor as any of the sons of men it is something more than human more than can agree to any created being it speaks the creator of all a god a god appears yea o on the being of beings jehovah the selfexistent the supreme the god who is over all blessed for ever this divine discourse delivered in the most excellent method every subsequent part illustrating those that precede is commonly and not improperly divided into three principal branches the first contained in the fifth  the second in the sixth  and the third in the seventh chapter in the first the sum of all true religion is laid down in eight particulars which are explained and guarded against the false glosses of man in the following parts of the fifth chapter in the second are rules for that right intention which we are to preserve in all our outward actions unmixed with worldly desires or anxious cares for even the necessaries of life in the third are cautions against the mainhinderances of religion closed with an application of the whole i 1 our lord first lays down the sum of all true religion in eight particulars which he explains and guards against the false glosses of men to the end of the fifth chapter some have supposed that he designed in these to point out the several stages of the christian course the steps which a christian successively takes in his journey to the promised land  others that all the particulars here set down belong at all times to every christian and why may we not allow both the one and the other what inconsistency is there between them it is undoubtedly true that both poverty of spirit and every other temper which is here mentioned are at all times found in a greater or less degree in every real christian and it is equally true that real christianity always begins in poverty of spirit and goes on in the order here set down till the man of god is made perfect we begin at the lowest of these gifts of god yet so as not to relinquish this when we are called of god to come up higher but whereunto we have already attained we hold fast while we press on to what is yet before to the highest blessings of god in christ jesus 2 the foundation of all is poverty of spirit here therefore our lord begins blessed saith he are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven it may not improbably be supposed that our lord looked on those who were round about him and observing that not many rich were there but rather the poor of the world took occasion from thence to make a transition from temporal to spiritual things blessed saith he or happy  so the word should be rendered both in this and the following verses are the poor in spirit he does not say they that are poor as to outward circumstances  it being not impossible that some of these may be as far from happiness as a monarch upon his throne but the poor in spirit  they who whatever their outward circumstances are have that disposition of heart which is the first step to all real substantial happiness either in this world or that which is to come 3 some have judged that by the poor in spirit here are meant those who love poverty those who are free from covetousness from the love of money who fear rather than desire riches perhaps they have been induced so to judge by wholly confining their thoughts to the very term or by considering that weighty observation of st paul that the love of money is the root of all evil and hence many have wholly divested themselves not only of riches but of all worldly goods hence also the vows of voluntary poverty seem to have arisen in the romish church it being supposed that so eminent a degree of this fundamental grace must be a large step toward the kingdom of heaven   but these do not seem to have observed first that the expression of st paul must be understood with some restriction otherwise it is not true for the love of money is not the root the sole root of all evil there are a thousand other roots of evil in the world as sad experience daily shows his meaning can only be it is the root of very many evils perhaps of more than any single vice besides  secondly that this sense of the expression poor in spirit will by no means suit our lords present design which is to lay a general foundation whereon the whole fabric of christianity may be built a design which would be in no wise answered by guarding against one particular vice so that if even this were supposed to be one part of his meaning it could not possibly be the whole  thirdly that it cannot be supposed to be any part of his meaning unless we charge him with manifest tautology seeing if poverty of spirit were only freedom from covetousness from the love of money or the desire of riches it would coincide with what he afterwards mentions it would be only a branch of purity of heart  4 who then are the poor in spirit without question the humble they who know themselves who are convinced of sin those to whom god hath given that first repentance which is previous to faith in christ one of these can no longer say i am rich and increased in goods and have need of nothing as now knowing that he is wretched and poor and miserable and blind and naked he is convinced that he is spiritually poor indeed having no spiritual good abiding in him in me saith he dwelleth no good thing but whatsoever is evil and abominable he has a deep sense of the loathsome leprosy of sin which be brought with him from his mothers womb which overspreads his whole soul and totally corrupts every power and faculty thereof he sees more and more of the evil tempers which spring from that evil root the pride and haughtiness of spirit the constant bias to think of himself more highly than he ought to think the vanity the thirst after the esteem or honour thatcometh from men the hatred or envy the jealousy or revenge the anger malice or bitterness the inbred enmity both against god and man which appears in ten thousand shapes the love of the world the selfwill the foolish and hurtful desires which cleave to his inmost soul he is conscious how deeply he has offended by his tongue if not by profane immodest untrue or unkind words yet by discourse which was not good to the use of edifying not meet to minister grace to the hearers which consequently was all corrupt in gods account and grievous to his holy spirit his evil works are now likewise ever in his sight if he tells them they are more than he is able to express he may as well think to number the drops of rain the sands of the sea or the days of eternity his guilt is now also before his face he knows the punishment he has deserved were it only on account of his carnal mind the entire universal corruption of his nature how much more on account of all his evil desires and thoughts of all his sinful words and actions he cannot doubt for a moment but the least of these deserves the damnation of hell  the worm thatdieth not and the fire that never shall be quenched above all the guilt of not believing on the name of the onlybegotten son of god lies heavy upon him how saith he shall i escape who neglect so great salvation he that believeth not is condemned already and the wrath of godabideth on him but what shall he give in exchange for his soul which is forfeited to the just vengeance of god wherewithal shall he come before the lord how shall he pay him that heoweth were he from this moment to perform the most perfect obedience to every command of god this would make no amends for a single sin for any one act of past disobedience seeing he owes god all the service he is able to perform from this moment to all eternity could he pay this it would make no manner of amends for what he ought to have done before he sees himself therefore utterly helpless with regard to atoning for his past sins utterly unable to make any amends to god to pay any ransom for his own soul but if god would forgive him all that is past on this one condition that he should sin no more that for the time to come he should entirely and constantly obey all his commands he well knows that this would profit him nothing being a condition he could never perform he knows and feels that he is not able to obey even the outward commands of god seeing these cannot be obeyed while his heart remains in its natural sinfulness and corruption inasmuch as an evil tree cannot bring forth good fruit but he cannot cleanse a sinful heart with men this is impossible so that he is utterly at a loss even how to begin walking in the path of gods commandments he knows not how to get one step   forward in the way encompassed with sin and sorrow and fear and finding no way to escape he can only cry out lord save or i perish poverty of spirit then as it implies the first step we take in running the race which is set before us is a just sense of our inward and outward sins and of our guilt and helplessness this some have monstrously styled the virtue of humility thus teaching us to be proud of knowing we deserve damnation but our lords expression is quite of another kind conveying no idea to the hearer but that of mere want of naked sin of helpless guilt and misery the great apostle where he endeavours to bring sinners to god speaks in a manner just answerable to this the wrath of god saith he is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men rom 118 c a charge which he immediately fixes on the heathen world and thereby proves they are under the wrath of god he next shows that the jews were no better than they and were therefore under the same condemnation and all this not in order to their attaining the noble virtue of humility but that every mouth might be stopped and all the world become guilty before god he proceeds to show that they were helpless as well as guilty which is the plain purport of all those expressions therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified  but now the righteousness of god which is by faith of jesus christ without the law is manifested  we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law  expressions all tending to the same point even to hide pride from man to humble him to the dust without teaching him to reflect upon his humility as a virtue to inspire him with that full piercing conviction of his utter sinfulness guilt and helplessness which casts the sinner stripped of all lost and undone on his strong helper jesus christ the righteous one cannot but observe here that christianity begins just where heathen morality ends poverty of spirit conviction of sin the renouncing ourselves the not having our own righteousness the very first point in the religion of jesus christ leaving all pagan religion behind this was ever hid from the wise men of this world insomuch that the whole roman language even with all the improvements of the augustan age does not afford so much as a name for humility the word from whence we borrow this as is well known bearing in latin a quite different meaning no nor was one found in all the copious language of greece till it was made by the great apostle o that we may feel what they were not able to express sinner awake know thyself know and feel that thou wert shapen in wickedness and that in sin did thy mother conceive thee and that thou thyself hast been heaping up sin upon sin ever since thou couldst discern good from evil sink under the mighty hand of god as guilty of death eternal and cast off renounce abhor all imagination of ever being able to help thyself be it all thy hope to be washed in his blood and renewed by his almighty spirit who himself bare all our sins in his own body on the tree so shalt thou witness happy are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven this is that kingdom of heaven or of god which is within us even righteousness and peace and joy in the holy ghost and what is righteousness but the life of god in the soul the mind which was in christ jesus the image of god stamped upon the heart now renewed after the likeness of him that created it what is it but the love of god because he first loved us and the love of all mankind for his sake and what is this peace the peace of god but that calm serenity of soul that sweet repose in the blood of jesus which leaves no doubt of our acceptance in him which excludes all fear but the loving filial fear of offending our father which is in heaven this inward kingdom implies also joy in the holy ghost who seals upon our hearts the redemption which is in jesus the righteousness of christ imputed to us for the remission of the sins that are past who giveth us now the earnest of our inheritance of the crown which the lord the righteous judge will give at that day and well may this be termed the kingdom of heaven seeing it is heaven already opened in the soul the first springing up of those rivers of pleasure which flow at gods right hand for evermore   12 theirs is the kingdom of heaven whosoever thou art to whom god hath given to be poor in spirit to feel thyself lost thou hast a right thereto through the gracious promise of him who cannot lie it is purchased for thee by the blood of the lamb it is very nigh thou art on the brink of heaven another step and thou enterest into the kingdom of righteousness and peace and joy art thou all sin behold the lamb of god whotaketh away the sin of the world  all unholy see thy advocate with the father jesus christ the righteous  art thou unable to atone for the least of thy sins he is the propitiation for all thy sins now believe on the lord jesus christ and all thy sins are blotted out  art thou totally unclean in soul and body here is the fountain for sin and uncleanness arise and wash away thy sins stagger no more at the promise through unbelief give glory to god dare to believe now cry out from the ground of thy heart  yes i yield i yield at last listen to thy speaking blood me with all my sins i cast on my atoning god 13 then thou learnest of him to be lowly of heart and this is the true genuine christian humility which flows from a sense of the love of god reconciled to us in christ jesus poverty of spirit in this meaning of the word begins where a sense of guilt and of the wrath of god ends and is a continual sense of our total dependence on him for every good thought or word or work of our utter inability to all good unless he water us every moment and an abhorrence of the praise of men knowing that all praise is due unto god only with this is joined a loving shame a tender humiliation before god even for the sins which we know he hath forgiven us and for the sin which stillremaineth in our hearts although we know it is not imputed to our condemnation nevertheless the conviction we feel of inbred sin is deeper and deeper every day the more we grow in grace the more do we see of the desperate wickedness of our heart the more we advance in the knowledge and love of god through our lord jesus christ as great a mystery as this may appear to those who know not the power of god unto salvation the more do we discern of our alienation from god of the enmity that is in our carnal mind and the necessity of our being entirely renewed in righteousness and true holiness ii 1 it is true he has scarce any conception of this who now begins to know the inward kingdom of heaven in his prosperity he saith i shall never be moved thou lord hast made my hill so strong sin is so utterly bruised beneath his feet that he can scarce believe itremaineth in him even temptation is silenced and speaks not again it cannot approach but stands afar off he is borne aloft in the chariots of joy and love he soars as upon the wings of an eagle but our lord well knew that this triumphant state does not often continue long he therefore presently subjoins blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted not that we can imagine this promise belongs to those who mourn only on some worldly account who are in sorrow and heaviness merely on account of some worldly trouble or disappointment  such as the loss of their reputation or friends or the impairing of their fortune as little title to it have they who are afflicting themselves through fear of some temporal evil or who pine away with anxious care or that desire of earthly things which maketh the heart sick let us not think these shall receive anything from the lord he is not in all their thoughts therefore it is that they thus walk in a vain shadow and disquiet themselves in vain and this shall ye have of mine hand saith the lord ye shall lie down in sorrow the mourners of whom our lord here speaks are those that mourn on quite another account they that mourn after god after him in whom they did rejoice with joy unspeakable when he gave them to taste the good the pardoning word and the powers of the world to come but he now hides his face and they are troubled they cannot see him through the dark cloud but they see temptation and sin which they fondly supposed were gone never to return arising again following after them amain and holding them in on every side it is not strange if their soul is now disquieted within them and trouble and heaviness take hold upon them nor will their great enemy fail to improve the   occasion to ask where is now thy god where is now the blessedness whereof thouspakest the beginning of the kingdom of heaven yea hath god said thy sins are forgiven thee surely god hath not said it it was only a dream a mere delusion a creature of thy own imagination if thy sins are forgiven why art thou thus can a pardoned sinner be thus unholy  and if then instead of immediately crying to god they reason with him that is wiser than they they will be in heaviness indeed in sorrow of heart in anguish not to be expressed nay even when god shines again upon the soul and takes away all doubt of his past mercy still he that is weak in faith may be tempted and troubled on account of what is to come especially when inward sin revives and thrusts sore at him that he may fall then may he again cry out i have a sin of fear that when ive spun my last thread i shall perish on the shore  lest i should make shipwreck of the faith and my last state be worse than the first  lest all my bread of life should fail and i sink down unchanged to hell sure it is that this affliction for the present is not joyous but grievous nevertheless afterward it bringeth forth peaceable fruit unto them that are exercised thereby blessed therefore are they that thus mourn if they tarry the lords leisure and suffer not themselves to be turned out of the way by the miserable comforters of the world if they resolutely reject all the comforts of sin of folly and vanity all the idle diversions and amusements of the world all the pleasures which perish in the using and which only tend to benumb and stupefy the soul that it may neither be sensible of itself nor god blessed are they who follow on to know the lord and steadily refuse all other comfort they shall be comforted by the consolations of his spirit by a fresh manifestation of his love by such a witness of his accepting them in the beloved as shall never more be taken away from them this full assurance of faith swallows up all doubt as well as all tormenting fear god now giving them a sure hope of an enduring substance and strong consolation through grace without disputing whether it be possible for any of those to fall away who were once enlightened and made partakers of the holy ghost it suffices them to say by the power now resting upon them who shall separate us from the love of christ  i am persuaded that neither death nor life nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth shall be able to separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus our lord rom 83539  this whole process both of mourning for an absent god and recovering the joy of his countenance seems to be shadowed out in what our lord spoke to his apostles the night before his passion do ye inquire of that i said a little while and ye shall not see me and again a little while and ye shall see me verily verily i say unto you that ye shall weep and lament namely when ye do not see me but the world shall rejoice shall triumph over you as though your hope were now come to an end and ye shall be sorrowful through doubt through fear through temptation through vehement desire but your sorrow shall be turned into joy by the return of him whom your soulloveth a woman when she is in travail hath sorrow because her hour is come but as soon as she is delivered of the child she remembereth no more the anguish for joy that a man is born into the world and ye now have sorrow ye mourn and cannot be comforted but i will see you again and your heart shall rejoice with calm inward joy and your joy no mantaketh from you john 161922 but although this mourning is at an end is lost in holy joy by the return of the comforter yet is there another and a blessed mourning it is which abides in the children of god they still mourn for the sins and miseries of mankind they weep with them that weep they weep for them that weep not for themselves for the sinners against their own souls they mourn for the weakness and unfaithfulness of those that are in some measure saved from their sins who is weak and they are not weak who is offended and they burn not they are grieved for the dishonour continually done to the majesty of heaven and earth at all times they have an awful sense of this which brings a deep seriousness upon their spirit a seriousness which is not a little increased since the eyes of their understanding were opened by their continually seeing the vast ocean of eternity without a bottom or   a shore which has already swallowed up millions of millions of men and is gaping to devour them that yet remain they see here the house of god eternal in the heavens there hell and destruction without a covering and thence feel the importance of every moment which just appears and is gone for ever  but all this wisdom of god is foolishness with the world the whole affair of mourning and poverty of spirit is with them stupidity anddulness nay it is well if they pass so favourable a judgment upon it if they do not vote it to be mere moping and melancholy if not downright lunacy and distraction and it is no wonder at all that this judgment should be passed by those who know not god suppose as two persons were walking together one should suddenly stop and with the strongest signs of fear and amazement cry out on what a precipice do we stand see we are on the point of being dashed in pieces another step and we fall into that huge abyss stop i will not go on for all the world  when the other who seemed to himself at least equally sharpsighted looked forward and saw nothing of all this what would he think of his companion but that he was beside himself that his head was out of order that much religion if he was not guilty of much learning had certainly made him mad  but let not the children of god the mourners insion be moved by any of these things ye whose eyes are enlightened be not troubled by those who walk on still in darkness ye do not walk on in a vain shadow god and eternity are real things heaven and hell are in very deed open before you and ye are on the edge of the great gulf it has already swallowed up more than words can express nations and kindreds and peoples and tongues and still yawns to devour whether they see it or no the giddy miserable children of men o cry aloud spare not lift up your voice to him who grasps both time and eternity both for yourselves and your brethren that ye may be counted worthy to escape the destruction that cometh as a whirlwind that ye may be brought safe through all the waves and storms into the haven where you would be weep for yourselves till he wipes away the tears from your eyes and even then weep for the miseries that come upon the earth till the lord of all shall put a period to misery and sin shall wipe away the tears from all faces and the knowledge of the lord shall cover the earth as the waters cover the sea   sermon 22 text of the 1872 edition upon our lords sermon on the mount discourse 2 blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy matt 557 i 1 when the winter is past when the time of singing is come and the voice of the turtle is heard in the land when he that comforts the mourners is now returned that he may abide with them for ever when at the brightness of his presence the clouds disperse the dark clouds of doubt and uncertainty the storms of fear flee away the waves of sorrow subside and their spirit againrejoiceth in god their saviour then is it that this word is eminently fulfilled then those whom he hath comforted can bear witness blessed or happy are the meek for they shall inherit the earth but who are the meek not those who grieve at nothing because they know nothing who are not discomposed at the evils that occur because they discern not evil from good not those who are sheltered from the shocks of life by a stupid insensibility who have either by nature or art the virtue of stocks and stones and resent nothing because they feel nothing brute philosophers are wholly unconcerned in this matter apathy is as far from meekness as from humanity so that one would not easily conceive how any christians of the purer ages especially any of the fathers of the church could confound these and mistake one of the foulest errors of heathenism for a branch of true christianity  nor does christian meekness imply the being without zeal for god any more than it does ignorance or insensibility no it keeps clear of every extreme whether in excess or defect it does not destroy but balance the affections which the god of nature never designed should be rooted out by grace but only brought and kept under due regulations it poises the mind aright it holds an even scale with regard to anger and sorrow and fear preserving the mean in every circumstance of life and not declining either to the right hand or the left meekness therefore seems properly to relate to ourselves but it may be referred either to god or our neighbour when this due composure of mind has reference to god it is usually termed resignation a calm acquiescence in whatsoever is his will concerning us even though it may not be pleasing to nature saying continually it is the lord let him do whatseemeth him good when we consider it more strictly with regard to ourselves we style it patience or contentedness when it is exerted toward other men then it is mildness to the good and gentleness to the evil they who are truly meek can clearly discern what is evil and they can also suffer it they are sensible of everything of this kind but still meekness holds the reins they are exceeding zealous for the lord of hosts but their zeal is always guided by knowledge and tempered in every thought  and word and work with the love of man as well as the love of god they do not desire to extinguish any of the passions which god has for wise ends implanted in their nature but they have the mastery of all they hold them all in subjection and employ them only in subservience to those ends and thus even the harsher and more unpleasing passions are applicable to the noblest purposes even hatred and anger and fear when engaged against sin and regulated by faith and love are as walls and bulwarks to the soul so that the wicked one cannot approach to hurt it it is evident this divine temper is not only to abide but to increase in us day by day occasions of exercising and thereby increasing it will never be wanting while we remain upon earth we have need of patience that after we have done and suffered the will of god we may receive the promise we have need of resignation that we may in all circumstances say not as i will but as thou wilt   and we have need of gentleness toward all men but especially toward the evil and unthankful otherwise we shall be overcome of evil instead of overcoming evil with good nor does meekness restrain only the outward act as the scribes andpharisees taught of old and the miserable teachers who are not taught of god will not fail to do in all ages our lord guards against this and shows the true extent of it in the following words ye have heard that it was said by them of old time thou shalt not kill and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment matt 521 c but i say unto you that whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment and whosoever shall say to his brotherraca shall be in danger of the council but whosoever shall say thou fool shall be in danger of hellfire our lord here ranks under the head of murder even that anger which goes no farther than the heart which does not show itself by an outward unkindness no not so much as a passionate word whosoever is angry with his brother with any man living seeing we are all brethren whosoever feels any unkindness in his heart any temper contrary to love whosoever is angry without a cause without a sufficient cause or farther than that cause requires shall be in danger of the judgment enochos estai shall in that moment be obnoxious to the righteous judgment of god but would not one be inclined to prefer the reading of those copies which omit the wordeike without a cause is it not entirely superfluous for if anger at persons be a temper contrary to love how can there be a cause a sufficient cause for it  any that will justify it in the sight of god anger at sin we allow in this sense we may be angry and yet we sin not in this sense our lord himself is once recorded to have been angry he looked round about upon them with anger being grieved for the hardness of their hearts he was grieved at the sinners and angry at the sin and this is undoubtedly right before god 9 and whosoever shall say to his brotherraca  whosoever shall give way to anger so as to utter any contemptuous word it is observed by commentators thatraca is a syriac word which properly signifies empty vain foolish so that it is as inoffensive an expression as can well be used toward one at whom we are displeased and yet whosoever shall use this as our lord assures us shall be in danger of the council rather shall be obnoxious thereto he shall be liable to a severer sentence from the judge of all the earth but whosoever shall say thou fool  whosoever shall so give place to the devil as to break out into reviling into designedly reproachful and contumelious language shall be obnoxious to hellfire shall in that instant be liable to the highest condemnation it should be observed that our lord describes all these as obnoxious to capital punishment the first to strangling usually inflicted on those who were condemned in one of the inferior courts the second to stoning which was frequently inflicted on those who were condemned by the great council at jerusalem the third to burning alive inflicted only on the highest offenders in the valley of the sons ofhinnom ge hennon from which that word is evidently taken which we translate hell 10 and whereas men naturally imagine that god will excuse their defect in some duties for their exactness in others our lord next takes care to cut off that vain though common imagination he shows that it is impossible for any sinner to commute with god who will not accept one duty for another nor take a part of obedience for the whole he warns us that the performing our duty to god will not excuse us from our duty to our neighbour that works of piety as they are called will be so far from commending us to god if we are wanting in charity that on the contrary that want of charity will make all those works an abomination to the lord therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar and there rememberest that thy brother hath aught against thee  on account of thy unkind behaviour toward him of thy calling himraca or thou fool think not that thy gift will atone for thy anger or that it will find any acceptance with god so long as thy conscience is defiled with the guilt of unrepented sin leave there thy gift before the altar and go thy way first be reconciled to thy brother at least do all that in thee lies toward being reconciled and then come and offer thy gift matt 523 24   and let there be no delay in what so nearlyconcerneth thy soul agree with thine adversary quickly  now upon the spot whiles thou art in the way with him if it be possible before he go out of thy sight lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge lest he appeal to god the judge of all and the judge deliver thee to the officer to satan the executioner of the wrath of god and thou be cast into prison into hell there to be reserved to the judgment of the great day verily i say unto thee thou shalt by no means come out thence till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing but this it is impossible for thee ever to do seeing thou hast nothing to pay therefore if thou art once in that prison the smoke of thy torment must ascend up for ever and ever meantime the meek shall inherit the earth such is the foolishness of worldly wisdom the wise of the world had warned them again and again  that if they did not resent such treatment if they would tamely suffer themselves to be thus abused there would be no living for them upon earth that they would never be able to procure the common necessaries of life nor to keep even what they had that they could expect no peace no quiet possession no enjoyment of anything most true  suppose there were no god in the world or suppose he did not concern himself with the children of men but when god ariseth to judgment and to help all the meek upon earth how doth he laugh all this heathen wisdom to scorn and turn the fierceness of man to his praise he takes a peculiar care to provide them with all things needful for life and godliness he secures to them the provision he hath made in spite of the force fraud or malice of men and what he secures he gives them richly to enjoy it is sweet to them be it little or much as in patience they possess their souls so they truly possess whatever god hath given them they are always content always pleased with what they have it pleases them because it pleases god so that while their heart their desire their joy is in heaven they may truly be said to inherit the earth  but there seems to be a yet farther meaning in these words even that they shall have a more eminent part in the new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness in that inheritance a general description of which and the particulars we shall know hereafter st john has given in the twentieth chapter of the revelation and i saw an angel come down from heaven  and he laid hold on the dragon that old serpent  and bound him a thousand years  and i saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of jesus and for the word of god and of them which had not worshipped the beast neither his image neither had received his mark upon their foreheads or in their hands and they lived and reigned with christ a thousand years but the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished this is the first resurrection blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection on such the second death hath no power but they shall be priests of god and of christ and shall reign with him a thousand years rev 2016 ii 1 our lord has hitherto been more immediately employed in removing the hindrances of true religion such is pride the first grand hindrance of all religion which is taken away by poverty of spirit levity and thoughtlessness which prevent any religion from taking root in the soul till they are removed by holy mourning such are anger impatience discontent which are all healed by christian meekness and when once these hindrances are removed these evil diseases of the soul which were continually raising false cravings therein and filling it with sickly appetites the native appetite of a heavenborn spirit returns it hungers and thirsts after righteousness and blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled righteousness as was observed before is the image of god the mind which was in christ jesus it is every holy and heavenly temper in one springing from as well as terminating in the love of god as our father and redeemer and the love of all men for his sake blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after this in order fully to understand which expression we should observe first that hunger and thirst are the strongest of all our bodily appetites in like manner this hunger in the soul this thirst after the image of god is the strongest of all our spiritual appetites when it is once awakened in the heart yea it swallows up all the rest in that one great desire  to be renewed after the likeness of him that created us we should secondly observe that from the time we begin to hunger and thirst those appetites do not cease but are more and more craving and importunate till we either eat and drink or die and even so from the time that we begin to hunger and thirst after the whole mind which was in christ these spiritual appetites do not cease but cry after their food with more and more importunity nor can they possibly cease   before they are satisfied while there is any spiritual life remaining we may thirdly observe that hunger and thirst are satisfied with nothing but meat and drink if you would give to him that is hungry all the world beside all the elegance of apparel all the trappings of state all the treasure upon earth yea thousands of gold and silver if you would pay him ever so much honour  he regards it not all these things are then of no account with him he would still say these are not the things i want give me food or else i die the very same is the case with every soul that truly hungers and thirsts after righteousness he can find no comfort in anything but this he can be satisfied with nothing else whatever you offer besides it is lightly esteemed whether it be riches or honour or pleasure he still says this is not the thing which i want give me love or else i die and it is as impossible to satisfy such a soul a soul that is athirst for god the living god with what the world accounts religion as with what they account happiness the religion of the world implies three things 1 the doing no harm the abstaining from outward sin at least from such as is scandalous as robbery theft common swearing drunkenness 2 the doing good the relieving the poor the being charitable as it is called 3 the using the means of grace at least the going to church and to the lords supper he in whom these three marks are found is termed by the world a religious man but will this satisfy him who hungers after god no it is not food for his soul he wants a religion of a nobler kind a religion higher and deeper than this he can no more feed on this poor shallow formal thing than he can fill his belly with the east wind true he is careful to abstain from the very appearance of evil he is zealous of good works he attends all the ordinances of god but all this is not what he longs for this is only the outside of that religion which he insatiably hungers after the knowledge of god in christ jesus the life which is hid with christ in god the being  joined unto the lord in one spirit the having fellowship with the father and the son the walking in the light as god is in the light the being purified even as he is pure  this is the religion the righteousness he thirsts after nor can he rest till he thus rests in god blessed are they who thus hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled they shall be filled with the things which they long for even with righteousness and true holiness god shall satisfy them with the blessings of his goodness with the felicity of his chosen he shall feed them with the bread of heaven with the manna of his love he shall give them to drink of his pleasures as out of the river which he thatdrinketh of shall never thirst only for more and more of the water of life this thirst shall endure for ever the painful thirst the fond desire thy joyous presence shall remove but my full soul shall still require a whole eternity of love 6 whosoever then thou art to whom god hath given to hunger and thirst after righteousness cry unto him that thou mayest never lose that inestimable gift  that this divine appetite may never cease if many rebuke thee and bid thee hold thy peace regard them not yea cry so much the more jesus master have mercy on me  let me not live but to be holy as thou art holy no more spend thy money for that which is not bread nor thy labour for that whichsatisfieth not canst thou hope to dig happiness out of the earth  to find it in the things of the world o trample under foot all its pleasures despise its honours count its riches as dung and dross  yea and all the things which are beneath the sun for the excellency of the knowledge of christ jesus for the entire renewal of thy soul in that image of god wherein it was originally created beware of quenching that blessed hunger and thirst by what the world calls religion a religion of form of outward show which leaves the heart as earthly and sensual as ever let nothing satisfy thee but the power of godliness but a religion that is spirit and life thy dwelling in god and god in thee  the being an inhabitant of eternity the entering in by the blood of sprinkling within the veil and sitting in heavenly places with christ jesus   iii 1 and the more they are filled with the life of god the more tenderly will they be concerned for those who are still without god in the world still dead in trespasses and sins nor shall this concern for others lose its reward blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy the word used by our lord more immediately implies the compassionate the tenderhearted those who far from despising earnestly grieve for those that do not hunger after god this eminent part of brotherly love is here by a common figure put for the whole so that the merciful in the full sense of the term are they who love their neighbours as themselves because of the vast importance of this love  without which though we spake with the tongues of men and angels though we had the gift of prophecy and understood all mysteries and all knowledge though we had all faith so as to remove mountains yea though we gave all our goods to feed the poor and our very bodies to be burned it would profit us nothing  the wisdom of god has given us by the apostle paul a full and particular account of it by considering which we shall most clearly discern who are the merciful that shall obtain mercy charity or love as it were to be wished it had been rendered throughout being a far plainer and less ambiguous word the love of our neighbour as christ hath loved ussuffereth long is patient toward all men it suffers all the weakness ignorance errors infirmities all the frowardness and littleness of faith of the children of god all the malice and wickedness of the children of the world and it suffers all this not only for a time for a short season but to the end still feeding our enemy when he hungers if he thirst still giving him drink thus continually heaping coals of fire of melting love upon his head and in every step toward this desirable end the overcoming evil with good love is kind chresteuetai a word not easily translated it is soft mild benign it stands at the utmost distance from moroseness from all harshness or sourness of spirit and inspires the sufferer at once with the most amiable sweetness and the most fervent and tender affection consequently loveenvieth not it is impossible it should it is directly opposite to that baneful temper it cannot be that he who has this tender affection to all who earnestly wishes all temporal and spiritual blessings all good things in this world and the world to come to every soul that god hath made should be pained at his bestowing any good gift on any child of man if he has himself received the same he does not grieve but rejoice that another partakes of the common benefit if he has not he blesses god that his brother at least has and is herein happier than himself and the greater his love the more does he rejoice in the blessings of all mankind the farther is he removed from every kind and degree of envy toward any creature love ou perpereuetai  not vaunteth not itself which coincides with the very next words but rather as the word likewise properly imports is not rash or hasty in judging it will not hastily condemn any one it does not pass a severe sentence on a slight or sudden view of things it first weighs all the evidence particularly that which is brought in favour of the accused a true lover of his neighbour is not like the generality of men who even in cases of the nicest nature see a little presume a great deal and so jump to the conclusion no he proceeds with wariness and circumspection taking heed to every step willingly subscribing to that rule of the ancient heathen o where will the modern christian appear i am so far from lightly believing what one man says against another that i will not easily believe what a man says against himself i will always allow him second thoughts and many times counsel too it follows love is not puffed up it does not incline or suffer any man to think more highly of himself than he ought to think but rather to think soberly yea it humbles the soul unto the dust it destroys all high conceits engendering pride and makes us rejoice to be as nothing to be little and vile the lowest of all the servant of all they who are kindlyaffectioned one to another with brotherly love cannot but in honour prefer one another those who having the same love are of one accord do in lowliness of mind each esteem other better than themselves   it doth not behave itself unseemly it is not rude or willingly offensive to any it renders to all their due fear to whom fear honour to whom honour courtesy civility humanity to all the world in their several degrees honouring all men a late writer defines good breeding nay the highest degree of it politeness a continual desire to please appearing in all the behaviour but if so there is none so wellbred as a christian a lover of all mankind for he cannot but desire to please all men for their good to edification and this desire cannot be hid it will necessarily appear in all his intercourse with men for his love is without dissimulation it will appear in all his actions and conversation yea and will constrain him though without guile to become all things to all men if by any means he may save some and in becoming all things to all men loveseeketh not her own in striving to please all men the lover of mankind has no eye at all to his own temporal advantage he covets no mans silver or gold or apparel he desires nothing but the salvation of their souls yea in some sense he may be said not to seek his own spiritual any more than temporal advantage for while he is on the full stretch to save their souls from death he as it were forgets himself he does not think of himself so long as that zeal for the glory of god swallows him up nay at some times he may almost seem through an excess of love to give up himself both his soul and his body while he cries out with moses o this people have sinned a great sin yet now if thou wilt forgive their sin   and if not blot me out of the book which thou hast written exod 3231 32  or with st paul i could wish that myself were accursed from christ for my brethren my kinsmen according to the fleshrom 93  10 no marvel that such love is not provoked ou paroxynetai let it be observed the word easily strangely inserted in the translation is not in the original st pauls words are absolute love is not provoked it is not provoked to unkindness toward any one occasions indeed will frequently occur outward provocations of various kinds but love does not yield to provocation it triumphs over all in all trials it looketh unto jesus and is more than conqueror in his love it is not improbable that our translators inserted that word as it were to excuse the apostle who as they supposed might otherwise appear to be wanting in the very love which he so beautifully describes they seem to have supposed this from a phrase in the acts of the apostles which is likewise very inaccurately translated when paul andbarnabas disagreed concerning john the translation runs thus and the contention was so sharp between them that they departed asunder acts 1539 this naturally induces the reader to suppose that they were equally sharp therein that st paul who was undoubtedly right with regard to the point in question it being quite improper to take john with them again who had deserted them before was as much provoked asbarnabas who gave such a proof of his anger as to leave the work for which he had been set apart by the holy ghost but the original imports no such thing nor does it affirm that st paul was provoked at all it simply says egeneto oun paroxysmos  and there was a sharpness a paroxysm of anger in consequence of whichbarnabas left st paul took john and went his own way paul then chosesilas and departed being recommended by the brethren to the grace of god which is not said concerning barnabas and he went through syria and cilicia as he had proposed confirming the churches acts 153941 but to return  11 love prevents a thousandprovocations which would otherwise arise because it thinketh no evil indeed the merciful man cannot avoid knowing many things that are evil he cannot but see them with his own eyes and hear them with his own ears for love does not put out his eyes so that it is impossible for him not to see that such things are done neither does it take away his understanding any more than his senses so that he cannot but know that they are evil for instance when he sees a man strike his neighbour or hears him blaspheme god he cannot either question the thing done or the words spoken or doubt of their being evil yet ou logizetai to kakon the word logizetai thinketh does not refer either to our seeing and hearing or to the first and involuntary acts of our understanding but to our willingly thinking what we need not our inferring evil where it does not appear to our reasoning concerning things which we do not see our supposing what we have neither seen nor heard this is what true love absolutely destroys it tears up root and branch all imagining what we have not known it casts out all jealousies all evilsurmisings all readiness to believe evil it is frank open unsuspicious and as it cannot design so neither does it fear evil   it rejoiceth not in iniquity common as this is even among those who bear the name of christ who scruple not to rejoice over their enemy when hefalleth either into affliction or error or sin indeed how hardly can they avoid this who are zealously attached to any party how difficult is it for them not to be pleased with any fault which they discover in those of the opposite party  with any real or supposed blemish either in their principles or practice what warm defender of any cause is clear of these yea who is so calm as to be altogether free who does not rejoice when his adversary makes a false step which he thinks will advantage his own cause only a man of love he alone weeps over either the sin or folly of his enemy takes no pleasure in hearing or in repeating it but rather desires that it may be forgotten for ever but he rejoiceth in the truth wheresoever it is found in the truth which is after godliness bringing forth its proper fruit holiness of heart and holiness of conversation he rejoices to find that even those who oppose him whether with regard to opinions or some points of practice are nevertheless lovers of god and in other respectsunreprovable he is glad to hear good of them and to speak all he can consistently with truth and justice indeed good in general is his glory and joy wherever diffused throughout the race of mankind as a citizen of the world he claims a share in the happiness of all the inhabitants of it because he is a man he is not unconcerned in the welfare of any man but enjoys whatsoever brings glory to god and promotes peace and goodwill among men this love covereth all things so without all doubt panta stegei should be translated for otherwise it would be the very same with panta hypomenei endureth all things because the merciful man rejoiceth not in iniquity neither does he willingly make mention of it whatever evil he sees hears or knows he nevertheless conceals so far as he can without making himself partaker of other mens sins wheresoever or with whomsoever he is if he sees anything which he approves not it goes not out of his lips unless to the person concerned if haply he may gain his brother so far is he from making the faults or failures of others the matter of his conversation that of the absent he never does speak at all unless he can speak well a talebearer a backbiter a whisperer an evilspeaker is to him all one as a murderer he would just as soon cut his neighbours throat as thus murder his reputation just as soon would he think of diverting himself by setting fire to his neighbours house as of thus scattering abroad arrows firebrands and death and saying am i not in sport  he makes one only exception sometimes he is convinced that it is for the glory of god or which comes to the same the good of his neighbour that an evil should not be covered in this case for the benefit of the innocent he is constrained to declare the guilty but even here 1 he will not speak at all till love superior love constrains him 2 he cannot do it from a general confused view of doing good or promoting the glory of god but from a clear sight of some particular end some determinate good which he pursues 3 still he cannot speak unless he be fully convinced that this very means is necessary to that end that the end cannot be answered at least not so effectually by any other way 4 he then doeth it with the utmost sorrow and reluctance using it as the last and worst medicine a desperate remedy in a desperate case a kind of poison never to be used but to expel poison consequently 5 he uses it as sparingly as possible and this he does with fear and trembling lest he should transgress the law of love by speaking too much more than he would have done by not speaking at all  love believeth all things it is always willing to think the best to put the most favourable construction on everything it is ever ready to believe whatever may tend to the advantage of any ones character it is easily convinced of what it earnestly desires the innocence or integrity of any man or at least of the sincerity of his repentance if he had once erred from the way it is glad to excuse whatever is amiss to condemn the offender as little as possible and to make all the allowance for human weakness which can be done without betraying the truth of god and when it can no longer believe then love hopeth all things is any evil related of any man love hopes that the relation is not true that the thing related was never done is it certain it was  but perhaps it was not done with such circumstances as are related so that allowing the fact there is room to hope it was not so ill as it is represented was the action apparently undeniably evil love hopes the intention was not so is it clear the design was evil too  yet might it not spring from the settled temper of the heart but from a start of passion or from some vehement temptation which   hurried the man beyond himself and even when it cannot be doubted but all the actions designs and tempers are equally evil still love hopes that god will at last make bare his arm and get himself the victory and that there shall be joy in heaven over this one sinner thatrepenteth more than over ninety and nine just persons that need no repentance 17 lastly it endureth all things this completes the character of him that is truly merciful he endureth not some not many things only not most but absolutely all things whatever the injustice the malice the cruelty of men can inflict he is able to suffer he calls nothing intolerable he never says of anything this is not to be borne no he can not only do but suffer all things through christ which strengtheneth him and all he suffers does not destroy his love nor impair it in the least it is proof against all it is a flame that burns even in the midst of the great deep many waters cannot quench his love neither can the floods drown it it triumphs over all it neverfaileth either in time or in eternity  in obedience to what heaven decrees knowledge shall fail and prophecy shall cease but lasting charitys more ample sway nor bound by time nor subject to decay in happy triumph shall for ever live and endless good diffuse and endless praise receive so shall the merciful obtain mercy not only by the blessing of god upon all their ways by his now repaying the love they bear to their brethren a thousand fold into their own bosom but likewise by an exceeding and eternal weight of glory in the kingdom prepared for them from the beginning of the world 18 for a little while you may say woe is me that i am constrained to dwell withmesech and to have my habitation among the tents ofkedar you may pour out your soul and bemoan the loss of true genuine love in the earth lost indeed you may well say but not in the ancient sense see how these christians love one another these christian kingdoms that are tearing out each others bowels desolating one another with fire and sword these christian armies that are sending each by thousands by ten thousands quick into hell these christian nations that are all on fire with intestine broils party against party faction against faction these christian cities where deceit and fraud oppression and wrong yea robbery and murder go not out of their streets these christian families torn asunder with envy jealousy anger domestic jars without number without end yea what is most dreadful most to be lamented of all these christian churches churches tell it not ingath  but alas how can we hide it either from jews turks or pagans that bear the name of christ the prince of peace and wage continual war with each other that convert sinners by burning them alive that are drunk with the blood of the saints  does this praise belong only to babylon the great the mother of harlots and abominations of the earth nay verily but reformed churches so called have fairly learned to tread in her steps protestant churches too know to persecute when they have power in their hands even unto blood and meanwhile how do they alsoanathematize each other devote each other to the nethermost hell what wrath what contention what malice what bitterness is everywhere found among them even where they agree in essentials and only differ in opinions or in the circumstantials of religion who follows after only the things that make for peace and things wherewith one may edify another o god how long shall thy promise fail fear it not ye little flock against hope believe in hope it is your fathers good pleasure yet to renew the face of the earth surely all these things shall come to an end and the inhabitants of the earth shall learn righteousness nation shall not lift up sword against nation neither shall they know war any more the mountains of the lords house shall be established on the top of the mountains and all the kingdoms of the earth shall become the kingdoms of our god they shall not then hurt or destroy in all his holy mountain but they shall call their walls salvation and their gates praise they shall all be without spot or blemish loving one another even as christ hath loved us  be thou part of the   firstfruits if the harvest is not yet do thou love thyneighbor as thyself the lord god fill thy heart with such a love to every soul that thou mayest be ready to lay down thy life for his sake may thy soul continually overflow with love swallowing up every unkind and unholy temper till hecalleth thee up into the region of love there to reign with him for ever and ever   sermon 23 text of the 1872 edition upon our lords sermon on the mount discourse 3 blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see god blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of god blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness sake for theirs is the kingdom of heaven blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake rejoice and be exceeding glad for great is your reward in heaven for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you matt 5812 i 1 how excellent things are spoken of the love of our neighbour it is the fulfilling of the law the end of the commandment without this all we have all we do all we suffer is of no value in the sight of god but it is that love of our neighbour which springs from the love of god otherwise itself is nothing worth it behoves us therefore to examine well upon what foundation our love of our neighbour stands whether it is really built upon the love of god whether we do love him because he first loved us whether we are pure in heart for this is the foundation which shall never be moved blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see god the pure in heart are they whose hearts god hath purified even as he is pure who are purified through faith in the blood of jesus from every unholy affection who being cleansed from all filthiness of flesh and spirit perfect holiness in the loving fear of god they are through the power of his grace purified from pride by the deepest poverty of spirit from anger from every unkind or turbulent passion by meekness and gentleness from every desire but to please and enjoy god to know and love him more and more by that hunger and thirst after righteousness which now engrosses their whole soul so that now they love the lord their god with all their heart and with all their soul and mind and strength  but how little has this purity of heart been regarded by the false teachers of all ages they have taught men barely to abstain from such outward impurities as god hath forbidden by name but they did not strike at the heart and by not guarding against they in effect countenanced inward corruptions a remarkable instance of this our lord has given us in the following words ye have heard that it was said by them of old time thou shalt not commit adultery matt 527 and in explaining this those blind leaders of the blind only insist on mens abstaining from the outward act but i say unto you whosoeverlooketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart matt 528 for god requireth truth in the inward parts he searcheth the heart and trieth the reins and if thou incline unto iniquity with thy heart the lord will not hear thee 4 and god admits no excuse for retaining anything which is an occasion of impurity therefore if thy right eye offend thee pluck it out and cast it from thee for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell matt 529 if persons as dear to thee as thy right eye be an occasion of thy thus offending god a means of exciting unholy desire in thy soul delay not forcibly separate from them and if thy right hand offend thee cut it off and cast it from thee for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell matt 530 if any who seem as necessary to thee as thy right hand be an occasion of sin of impure desire even though it were never to go beyond the heart never to break out in word or action constrain thyself to an entire and final parting cut them off at a stroke give them up to god any loss whether of pleasure or substance or friends is preferable to the loss of thy soul  two steps only it may not be improper to take before such an absolute and final separation first try whether the unclean spirit may not be driven out by fasting and prayer and by carefully abstaining   from every action and word and look which thou hast found to be an occasion of evil secondly if thou art not by this means delivered ask counsel of him thatwatcheth over thy soul or at least of some who have experience in the ways of god touching the time and manner of that separation but confer not with flesh and blood lest thou be given up to a strong delusion to believe a lie 5 nor may marriage itself holy and honourable as it is be used as a pretence for giving a loose to our desires indeed it hath been said whosoever will put away his wife let him give her a writing of divorcement and then all was well though he alleged no cause but that he did not like her or liked another better but i say unto you that whosoever shall put away his wife saving for the case of fornication that is adultery the word porneia signifying unchastity in general either in the married or unmarried state causeth her to commit adultery if she marry again and whosoever shall marry her that is put away committeth adultery matt 531 32 all polygamy is clearly forbidden in these words wherein our lord expressly declares that for any woman who has a husband alive to marry again is adultery by parity of reason it is adultery for any man to marry again so long as he has a wife alive yea although they were divorced unless that divorce had been for the cause of adultery in that only case there is noscripture which forbids to marry again  such is the purity of heart which god requires and works in those who believe on the son of his love and blessed are they who are thus pure in heart for they shall see god he will manifest himself unto them not only as he doth not unto the world but as he doth not always to his own children he will bless them with the clearest communications of his spirit the most intimate fellowship with the father and with the son he will cause his presence to go continually before them and the light of his countenance to shine upon them it is the ceaseless prayer of their heart i beseech thee show me thy glory and they have the petition they ask of him they now see him by faith the veil of the flesh being made as it were transparent even in these his lowest works in all that surrounds them in all that god has created and made they see him in the height above and in the depth beneath they see him filling all in all the pure in heart see all things full of god they see him in the firmament of heaven in the moon walking in brightness in the sun when herejoiceth as a giant to run his course they see him making the clouds his chariots and walking upon the wings of the wind they see him preparing rain for the earth and blessing the increase of it giving grass for the cattle and green herb for the use of man they see the creator of all wisely governing all and upholding all things by the word of his power o lord our governor how excellent is thy name in all the world  in all his providences relating to themselves to their souls or bodies the pure in heart do more particularly see god they see his hand ever over them for good giving them all things in weight and measure numbering the hairs of their head making a hedge round about them and all that they have and disposing all the circumstances of their life according to the depth both of his wisdom and mercy but in a more especial manner they see god in his ordinances whether they appear in the great congregation to pay him the honour due unto his name and worship him in the beauty of holiness or enter into their closets and there pour out their souls before their father which is in secret whether they search the oracles of god or hear the ambassadors of christ proclaiming glad tidings of salvation or by eating of that bread and drinking of that cup show forth his death till he come in the clouds of heaven  in all these his appointed ways they find such a near approach as cannot be expressed they see him as it were face to face and talk with him as a man talking with his friend  a fit preparation for those mansions above wherein they shall see him as he is but how far were they from seeing god who having heard that it had been said by them of old time thou shalt not forswear thyself but shalt perform unto the lord thine oaths matt 533 interpreted it thus thou shalt not forswear thyself when thouswearest by the lord jehovah thou shalt perform unto the lord these thine oaths but as to other oaths heregardeth them not   so the pharisees taught they not only allowed all manner of swearing in common conversation but accounted even forswearing a little thing so they had not sworn by the peculiar name of god   but our lord here absolutely forbids all common swearing as well as all false swearing and shows the heinousness of both by the same awful consideration that every creature is gods and he is everywhere present in all and over all i say unto you swear not at all neither by heaven for it is gods throne matt 534 and therefore this is the same as to swear by him whositteth upon the circle of the heavens nor by the earth for it is his footstool matt 535 and he is as intimately present in earth as heaven neither by jerusalem for it is the city of the great king and god is well known in her palaces neither shalt thou swear by thy head because thou canst not make one hair white or black matt 536 because even this it is plain is not thine but gods the sole disposer of all in heaven and earth but let your communication matt 537 your conversation your discourse with each other be yea yea nay nay a bare serious affirming or denying for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil ek tou ponerou estin is of the evil one proceedeth from the devil and is a mark of his children  that our lord does not here forbid the swearing in judgment and truth when we are required so to do by a magistrate may appear 1 from the occasion of this part of his discourse  the abuse he was here reproving  which was false swearing and common swearing the swearing before a magistrate being quite out of the question  2 from the very words wherein he forms the general conclusion let your communication or discourse be yea yea nay nay  3 from his own example for he answered himself upon oath when required by a magistrate when the high priest said unto him i adjure thee by the living god that thou tell us whether thou be the christ the son of god jesus immediately answered in the affirmative thou hast said that is the truth nevertheless or rather moreover i say unto you hereafter shall ye see the son of man sitting on the right hand of power and coming in the clouds of heaven matt2663 64  4 from the example of god even the father who willing the more abundantly to show unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel confirmed it by an oathheb 617  5 from the example of st paul who we think had the spirit of god and well understood the mind of his master god is my witness saith he to the romans that without ceasing i make mention of you always in my prayers rom 19 to the corinthians i call god to record upon my soul that to spare you i came not as yet unto corinth 2 cor 123 and to the philippians god is my record how greatly i long after you in the bowels of jesus christ phil 18 hence it undeniably appears that if the apostle knew the meaning of his lords words they do not forbid swearing on weighty occasions even to one another how much less before a magistrate  and lastly from that assertion of the great apostle concerning solemn swearing in general which it is impossible he could have mentioned without any touch of blame if his lord had totally forbidden it men verily swear by the greater by one greater than themselves and an oath for confirmation is to them the end of all strife heb 616  but the great lesson which our blessed lord inculcates here and which he illustrates by this example is that god is in all things and that we are to see the creator in the glass of every creature that we should use and look upon nothing as separate from god which indeed is a kind of practical atheism but with a true magnificence of thought survey heaven and earth and all that is therein as contained by god in the hollow of his hand who by his intimate presence holds them all in being who pervades and actuates the whole created frame and is in a true sense the soul of universe ii 1 thus far our lord has been more directly employed in teaching the religion of the heart he has shown what christians are to be he proceeds to show what they are to do also  how inward holiness is to exert itself in our outward conversation blessed saith he are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of god the peacemakers the word in the original is hoieirenopoioi it is well known that eirene in the sacred writings implies all manner of good every blessing that relates either to the soul or the body to time or eternity accordingly when st paul in the titles of his epistles wishes grace and peace to the romans or the corinthians it is as if he had said as a fruit of the free undeserved love and favour of god may you enjoy all blessings spiritual and temporal all the good things which god hath prepared for them that love him hence we may easily learn in how wide a sense the term peacemakers is to be understood in its literal meaning it implies those lovers of god and man who utterly detest and abhor all strife and   debate all variance and contention and accordingly labour with all their might either to prevent this fire of hell from being kindled or when it is kindled from breaking out or when it is broke out from spreading any farther they endeavour to calm the stormy spirits of men to quiet their turbulent passions to soften the minds of contending parties and if possible reconcile them to each other they use all innocent arts and employ all their strength all the talents which god has given them as well to preserve peace where it is as to restore it where it is not it is the joy of their heart to promote to confirm to increase mutual goodwill among men but more especially among the children of god however distinguished by things of smaller importance that as they have all one lord one faith as they are all called in one hope of their calling so they may all walk worthy of the vocation wherewith they are called with all lowliness and meekness with longsuffering forbearing one another in love endeavouring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace but in the full extent of the word a peacemaker is one that as he hath opportunity doth good unto all men one that being filled with the love of god and of all mankind cannot confine the expressions of it to his own family or friends or acquaintance or party or to those of his own opinions  no nor those who are partakers of like precious faith but steps over all these narrow bounds that he may do good to every man that he may some way or other manifest his love to neighbours and strangers friends and enemies he doth good to them all as he hath opportunity that is on every possible occasion redeeming the time in order thereto buying up every opportunity improving every hour losing no moment wherein he may profit another he does good not of one particular kind but good in general in every possible way employing herein all his talents of every kind all his powers and faculties of body and soul all his fortune his interest his reputation desiring only that when his lord cometh he may say well done good and faithful servant he doth good to the uttermost of his power even to the bodies of all men he rejoices to deal his bread to the hungry and to cover the naked with a garment is any a stranger he takes him in and relieves him according to his necessities are any sick or in prison he visits them and administers such help as they stand most in need of and all this he does not as unto man but remembering him that hath said inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren ye have done it unto me how much more does he rejoice if he can do any good to the soul of any man this power indeed belongeth unto god it is he only that changes the heart without which every other change is lighter than vanity nevertheless it pleases him whoworketh all in all to help man chiefly by man to convey his own power and blessing and love through one man to another therefore although it be certain that the help which is done upon earth god doth it himself yet has no man need on this account to stand idle in his vineyard the peacemaker cannot he is ever labouring therein and as an instrument in gods hand preparing the ground for his masters use or sowing the seed of the kingdom or watering what is already sown if haply god may give the increase according to the measure of grace which he has received he uses all diligence either to reprove the gross sinner to reclaim those who run on headlong in the broad way of destruction or to give light to them that sit in darkness and are ready to perish for lack of knowledge or to support the weak to lift up the hands that hang down and the feeble knees or to bring back and heal that which was lame and turned out of the way nor is he less zealous to confirm those who are already striving to enter in at the strait gate to strengthen those that stand that they may run with patience the race which is set before them to build up in their most holy faith those that know in whom they have believed to exhort them to stir up the gift of god which is in them that daily growing in grace an entrance may be ministered unto them abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our lord and saviour jesus christ  blessed are they who are thus continually employed in the work of faith and the labour of love for they shall be called that is shall be a common hebraism the children of god god shall continue unto them the spirit of adoption yea shall pour it more abundantly into their hearts he shall bless them with all the blessings of his children he shall acknowledge them as sons before angels and men and if sons then heirs heirs of god and joint heirs with christ   iii 1 one would imagine such a person as has been above described so full of genuine humility so unaffectedly serious so mild and gentle so free from all selfish design so devoted to god and such   an active lover of men should be the darling of mankind but our lord was better acquainted with human nature in its present state he therefore closes the character of this man of god with showing him the treatment he is to expect in the world blessed saith he are they which are persecuted for righteousness sake for theirs is the kingdom of heaven 2 in order to understand this throughly let us first inquire who are they that are persecuted and this we may easily learn from st paul as of old he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the spirit even so it is nowgal 429 yea saith the apostle and all that will live godly in christ jesus shall suffer persecution 2tim 312 the same we are taught by st john marvel not my brethren if the world hate you we know that we have passed from death unto life because we love the brethren 1 john 31314 as if he had said the brethren the christians cannot be loved but by them who have passed from death unto life and most expressly by our lord if the world hate you ye know that it hated me before it hated you if ye were of the world the world would love its own but because ye are not of the world therefore the worldhateth you remember the word that i said unto you the servant is not greater than his lord if they have persecuted me they will also persecute you john 1518 c by all these scriptures it manifestly appears who they are that are persecuted namely the righteous he that is born of the spirit all that will live godly in christ jesus they that are passed from death unto life those who are not of the world all those who are meek and lowly in heart that mourn for god that hunger after his likeness all that love god and their neighbour and therefore as they have opportunity do good unto all men if it be secondly inquired why they are persecuted the answer is equally plain and obvious it is for righteousness sake because they are righteous because they are born after the spirit because they will live godly in christ jesus because they are not of the world whatever may be pretended this is the real cause be their infirmities more or less still if it were not for this they would be borne with and the world would love its own they are persecuted because they are poor in spirit that is say the world poorspirited mean dastardly souls good for nothing not fit to live in the world  because they mourn they are such dull heavy lumpish creatures enough to sink anyones spirits that sees them they are mere deathheads they kill innocent mirth and spoil company wherever they come  because they are meek tame passive fools just fit to be trampled upon  because they hunger and thirst after righteousness a parcel of hotbrained enthusiasts gaping after they know not what not content with rational religion but running mad after raptures and inward feelings  because they are merciful lovers of all lovers of the evil and unthankful encouraging all manner of wickedness nay tempting people to do mischief by impunity and men who it is to be feared have their own religion still to seek very loose in their principles  because they are pure in heart uncharitable creatures that damn all the world but those that are of their own sort blasphemous wretches that pretend to make god a liar to live without sin  above all because they are peacemakers because they take all opportunities of doing good to all men this is the grand reason why they have been persecuted in all ages and will be till the restitution of all things if they would but keep their religion to themselves it would be tolerable but it is this spreading their errors this infecting so many others which is not to be endured they do so much mischief in the world that they ought to be tolerated no longer it is true the men do some things well enough they relieve some of the poor but this too is only done to gain the more to their party and so in effect to do the more mischief thus the men of the world sincerely think and speak and the more the kingdom of god prevails the more the peacemakers are enabled to propagate lowliness meekness and all other divine tempers the more mischief is done in their account consequently the more are they enraged against the authors of this and the more vehemently will they persecute them  let us thirdly inquire who are they that persecute them st paul answers he that is born after the flesh everyone who is not born of the spirit or at least desirous so to be all that do not at least labour to live godly in christ jesus all that are not passed from death unto life and consequently cannot love the brethren the world that is according to our saviours account they who know not him that sent me they who know not god even the loving pardoning god by the teaching of his own spirit   the reason is plain the spirit which is in the world is directly opposite to the spirit which is of god it must therefore needs be that those who are of the world will be opposite to those who are of god there is the utmost contrariety between them in all their opinions their desires designs and tempers and hitherto the leopard and the kid cannot lie down in peace together the proud because he is proud cannot but persecute the lowly the light and airy those that mourn and so in every other kind the unlikeness of disposition were there no other being a perpetual ground of enmity therefore were it only on this account all the servants of the devil will persecute the children of god 5 should it be inquired fourthly how they will persecute them it may be answered in general just in that manner and measure which the wise disposer of all sees will be most for his glory  will tend most to his childrens growth in grace and the enlargement of his own kingdom there is no one branch of gods government of the world which is more to be admired than this his ear is never heavy to the threatenings of the persecutor or the cry of the persecuted his eye is ever open and his hand stretched out to direct every the minutest circumstance when the storm shall begin how high it shall rise which way it shall point its course when and how it shall end are all determined by his unerring wisdom the ungodly are only a sword of his an instrument which he uses as itpleaseth him and which itself when the gracious ends of his providence are answered is cast into the fire at some rare times as when christianity was planted first and while it was taking root in the earth as also when the pure doctrine of christ began to be planted again in our nation god permitted the storm to rise high and his children were called to resist unto blood there was a peculiar reason why he suffered this with regard to the apostles that their evidence might be the more unexceptionable but from the annals of the church we learn another and a far different reason why he suffered the heavy persecutions which rose in the second and third centuries namely because the mystery of iniquity did so strongly work because of the monstrous corruptions which even then reigned in the church these god chastised and at the same time strove to heal by those severe but necessary visitations  perhaps the same observation may be made with regard to the grand persecution in our own land god had dealt very graciously with our nation he had poured out various blessings upon us he had given us peace abroad and at home and a king wise and good beyond his years and above all he had caused the pure light of his gospel to arise and shine amongst us but what return did he find he looked for righteousness but behold a cry  a cry of oppression and wrong of ambition and injustice of malice and fraud and covetousness yea the cry of those who even then expired in the flames entered into the ears of the lord of sabaoth it was then god arose to maintain his own cause against those that held the truth in unrighteousness then he sold them into the hands of their persecutors by a judgment mixed with mercy an affliction to punish and yet a medicine to heal the grievous backslidings of his people but it is seldom god suffers the storm to rise so high as torture or death or bonds or imprisonment whereas his children are frequently called to endure those lighter kinds of persecution they frequently suffer the estrangement of kinsfolk  the loss of the friends that were as their own soul they find the truth of their lords word concerning the event though not the design of his coming suppose ye that i am come to give peace on earth i tell you nay but rather division luke 1251 and hence will naturally follow loss of business or employment and consequently of substance but all these circumstances likewise are under the wise direction of god who allots to everyone what is most expedient for him but the persecution which attends all the children of god is that our lord describes in the following words blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you  shall persecute by reviling you  and say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake this cannot fail it is the very badge of our discipleship it is one of the seals of our calling it is a sure portion entailed on all the children of god if we have it not we are bastards and not sons straight through evil report as well as good report lies the only way to the kingdom the meek serious humble zealous lovers of god and man are of good report among their brethren but of evil report with the world who count and treat them as the filth and offscouring of all things   indeed some have supposed that before the fullness of the gentiles shall come in the scandal of the cross will cease that god will cause christians to be esteemed and loved even by those who are as yet in their sins yea and sure it is that even now he at some times suspends the contempt as well as the fierceness of men he makes a mans enemies to be at peace with him for a season and gives him favour with his bitterest persecutors but setting aside this exempt case the scandal of the cross is not yet ceased but a man may say still if i please men i am not the servant of christ let no man therefore regard that pleasing suggestion pleasing doubtless to flesh and blood that bad men only pretend to hate and despise them that are good but do indeed love and esteem them in their hearts not so they may employ them sometimes but it is for their own profit they may put confidence in them for they know their ways are not like other mens but still they love them not unless so far as the spirit of god may be striving with them our saviours words are express if ye were of the world the world would love its own but because ye are not of the world therefore the worldhateth you yea setting aside what exceptions may be made by the preventing grace or the peculiar providence of god ithateth them as cordially and sincerely as ever it did their master it remains only to inquire how are the children of god to behave with regard to persecution and first they ought not knowingly or designedly to bring it upon themselves this is contrary both to the example and advice of our lord and all his apostles who teach us not only not to seek but to avoid it as far as we can without injuring our conscience without giving up any part of that righteousness which we are to prefer before life itself so our lord expressly when they persecute you in this city flee ye into another which is indeed when it can be taken the most unexceptionable way of avoiding persecution  yet think not that you can always avoid it either by this or any other means if ever that idle imagination steals into your heart put it to flight by that earnest caution remember the word that i said unto you the servant is not greater than his lord if they have persecuted me they will also persecute you be ye wise as serpents and harmless as doves but will this screen you from persecution not unless you have more wisdom than your master or more innocence than the lamb of god neither desire to avoid it to escape it wholly for if you do you are none of his if you escape the persecution you escape the blessing the blessing of those who are persecuted for righteousness sake if you are not persecuted for righteousness sake you cannot enter into the kingdom of heaven if we suffer with him we shall also reign with him but if we deny him he will also deny us nay rather rejoice and be exceeding glad when men persecute you for his sake when they persecute you by reviling you and by saying all manner of evil against you falsely which they will not fail to mix with every kind of persecution they must blacken you to excuse themselves for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you  those who were most eminently holy in heart and life yea and all the righteous which ever have been from the beginning of the world rejoice because by his mark also ye know unto whom ye belong and because great is your reward in heaven  the reward purchased by the blood of the covenant and freely bestowed in proportion to your sufferings as well as to your holiness of heart and life be exceeding glad knowing that these light afflictions which are but for a moment work out for you a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory meantime let no persecution turn you out of the way of lowliness and meekness of love and beneficence ye have heard indeed that it hath been said an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth matt 538 and your miserable teachers have hence allowed you to avenge yourselves to return evil for evil but i say unto you that ye resist not evil  not thus not by returning it in kind but rather than do this whosoeversmiteth thee on thy right cheek turn to him the other also and if any man will sue thee at the law and take away thy coat let him have thy cloak also and whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile go with him twain so invincible let thy meekness be and be thy love suitable thereto give to him thatsketh thee and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away only give not away that which is another mans that which is not thine own therefore 1 take care to owe no man anything for what thou owest is not thy own but another mans 2 provide for those of thine own household this also god   hath required of thee and what is necessary to sustain them in life and godliness is also not thine own then 3 give or lend all that remains from day to day or from year to year only first seeing thou canst not give or lend to all remember the household of faith 13 the meekness and love we are to feel the kindness we are to show to them which persecute us for righteousness sake our blessed lord describes farther in the following verses o that they were graven upon our hearts ye have heard that it hath been said thou shalt love thy neighbour and hate thy enemy matt 543 c god indeed had said only the former part thou shalt love thy neighbour the children of the devil had added the latter and hate thy enemy but i say unto you 1 love your enemies see that you bear a tender goodwill to those who are most bitter of spirit against you who wish you all manner of evil 2 bless them that curse you are there any whose bitterness of spirit breaks forth in bitter words who are continually cursing and reproaching you when you are present and saying all evil against you when absent so much the rather do you bless in conversing with them use all mildness and softness of language reprove them by repeating a better lesson before them by showing them how they ought to have spoken and in speaking of them say all the good you can without violating the rules of truth and justice 3 do good to them that hate you let your actions show that you are as real in love as they in hatred return good for evil be not overcome of evil but overcome evil with good 4 if you can do nothing more at least pray for them that despitefully use you and persecute you you can never be disabled from doing this nor can all their malice or violence hinder you pour out your souls to god not only for those who did this once but now repent  this is a little thing if thy brother seven times a day turn and say unto thee i repent luke 174 that is if after ever so many relapses he give thee reason to believe that he is really and throughly changed then thou shalt forgive him so as to trust him to put him in thy bosom as if he had never sinned against thee at all  but pray for wrestle with god for those that do not repent that now despitefully use thee and persecute thee thus far forgive them not until seven times only but until seventy times seven matt 1822 whether they repent or no yea though they appear farther and farther from it yet show them this instance of kindness that ye may be the children that ye may approve yourselves the genuine children of your father which is in heaven who shows his goodness by giving such blessings as they are capable of even to his stubbornest enemies whomaketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good andsendeth rain on the just and on the unjust for if ye love them which love you what reward have ye do not even the publicans the same matt 546  who pretend to no religion whom ye yourselves acknowledge to be without god in the world and if ye salute show kindness in word or deed to your brethren your friends or kinsfolk only what do ye more than others  than those who have no religion at all do not even the publicans so matt 547 nay but follow ye a better pattern than them in patience in longsuffering in mercy in beneficence of every kind to all even to your bitterest persecutors be ye christians perfect in kind though not in degree even as your father which is in heaven is perfect matt 548  iv behold christianity in its native form as delivered by its great author this is the genuine religion of jesus christ such he presents it to him whose eyes are opened see a picture of god so far as he is imitable by man a picture drawn by gods own hand behold ye despisers and wonder and perish or rather wonder and adore rather cry out is this the religion of jesus ofnazareth the religion which i persecuted let me no more be found even to fight against god lord what wouldst thou have me to do what beauty appears in the whole how just a symmetry what exact proportion in every part how desirable is the happiness here described how venerable how lovely the holiness this is the spirit of religion the quintessence of it these are indeed the fundamentals of christianity o that we may not be hearers of it only  like a man beholding his own face in a glass whogoeth his way and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was nay but let us steadily look into this perfect law of liberty and continue therein let us not rest until every line thereof is transcribed into our own hearts let us watch and pray and believe and love and strive for the mastery till every part of it shall appear in our soul graven there by the finger of god till we are holy as he which hath called us is holy perfect as our father which is in heaven is perfect   sermon 24  text of the 1872 ed upon our lords sermon on the mount discourse 4 ye are the salt of the earth but if the salt hath lost its savour wherewith shall it be salted it is thenceforth good for nothing but to be cast out and trodden under foot of men ye are the light of the world a city that is set on an hill cannot be hid neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel but on a candlestick and itgiveth light to all that are in the house let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven math 51316 the beauty of holiness of that inward man of the heart which is renewed after the image of god cannot but strike every eye which god hath opened  every enlightened understanding the ornament of a meek humble loving spirit will at least excite the approbation of all those who are capable in any degree of discerning spiritual good and evil from the hour men begin to emerge out of the darkness which covers the giddy unthinking world they cannot but perceive how desirable a thing it is to be thus transformed into the likeness of him that created us this inward religion bears the shape of god so visibly impressed upon it that a soul must be wholly immersed in flesh and blood when he can doubt of its divine original we may say of this in a secondary sense even as of the son of god himself that it is the brightness of his glory the express image of his person apaugasma tes doxe autou  the beaming forth of his eternal glory and yet so tempered and softened that even the children of men may herein see god and live charakter tes hupostaseos autou  the character the stamp the living impression of his person who is the fountain of beauty and love the original source of all excellency and perfection if religion therefore were carried no farther than this they could have no doubt concerning it they should have no objection against pursuing it with the whole ardour of their souls but why say they is it clogged with other things what need of loading it with doing and suffering these are what damps the vigour of the soul and sinks it down to earth again is it not enough to follow after charity to soar upon the wings of love will it not suffice to worship god who is a spirit with the spirit of our minds without encumbering ourselves with outward things or even thinking of them at all is it not better that the whole extent of our thought should be taken up with high and heavenly contemplation and that instead of busying ourselves at all about externals we should only commune with god in our hearts  many eminent men have spoken thus have advised us to cease from all outward action wholly to withdraw from the world to leave the body behind us to abstract ourselves from all sensible things to have no concern at all about outward religion but to work all virtues in the will as the far more excellent way more perfective of the soul as well as more acceptable to god it needed not that any should tell our lord of this masterpiece of the wisdom from beneath this fairest of all the devices wherewith satan hath ever perverted the right ways of the lord and o what instruments hath he found from time to time to employ in this his service to wield this grand engine of hell against some of the most important truths of god  men that would deceive if it were possible the very elect the men of faith and love yea that have for a season deceived and led away no inconsiderable number of them who have fallen in all ages into the gilded snare and hardly escaped with the skin of their teeth but has our lord been wanting on his part has he not sufficiently guarded us against this pleasing delusion has he not armed us here with armour of proof against satan transformed into an angel of light yea verily he here defends in the clearest and strongest manner the active patient religion he had just described what can be fuller and plainer than the words he immediately subjoins to what   he had said of doing and suffering ye are the salt of the earth but if the salt have lost his savour wherewith shall it be salted it is thenceforth good for nothing but to be cast out and trodden under foot of men ye are the light of the world a city that is set on an hill cannot be hid neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel but on a candlestick and itgiveth light to all that are in the house let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven in order fully to explain and enforce these important words i shall endeavour to show first that christianity is essentially a social religion and that to turn it into a solitary one is to destroy it secondly that to conceal this religion is impossible as well as utterly contrary to the design of its author i shall thirdly answer some objections and conclude the whole with a practical application i 1 first i shall endeavour to show that christianity is essentially a social religion and that to turn it into a solitary religion is indeed to destroy it by christianity i mean that method of worshipping god which is here revealed to man by jesus christ when i say this is essentially a social religion i mean not only that it cannot subsist so well but that it cannot subsist at all without society  without living and conversing with other men and in showing this i shall confine myself to those considerations which will arise from the very discourse before us but if this be shown then doubtless to turn this religion into a solitary one is to destroy it not that we can in any wise condemn the intermixing solitude or retirement with society this is not only allowable but expedient nay it is necessary as daily experience shows for everyone that either already is or desires to be a real christian it can hardly be that we should spend one entire day in a continued intercourse with men without suffering loss in our soul and in some measure grieving the holy spirit of god we have need daily to retire from the world at least morning and evening to converse with god to commune more freely with our father which is in secret nor indeed can a man of experience condemn even longer seasons of religious retirement so they do not imply any neglect of the worldly employ wherein the providence of god has placed us yet such retirement must not swallow up all our time this would be to destroy not advance true religion for that the religion described by our lord in the foregoing words cannot subsist without society without our living and conversing with other men is manifest from hence that several of the most essential branches thereof can have no place if we have no intercourse with the world there is no disposition for instance which is more essential to christianity than meekness now although this as it implies resignation to god or patience in pain and sickness may subsist in a desert in a hermits cell in total solitude yet as it implies which it no less necessarily does mildness gentleness and longsuffering it cannot possibly have a being it has no place under heaven without an intercourse with other men so that to attempt turning this into a solitary virtue is to destroy it from the face of the earth another necessary branch of true christianity ispeacemaking or doing of good that this is equally essential with any of the other parts of the religion of jesus christ there can be no stronger argument to evince and therefore it would be absurd to allege any other than that it is here inserted in the original plan he has laid down of the fundamentals of his religion therefore to set aside this is the same daring insult on the authority of our great master as to set aside mercifulness purity of heart or any other branch of his institution but this is apparently set aside by all who call us to the wilderness who recommend entire solitude either to the babes or the young men or the fathers in christ for will any man affirm that a solitary christian so called though it is little less than a contradiction in terms can be a merciful man  that is one that takes every opportunity of doing all good to all men what can be more plain than that this fundamental branch of the religion of jesus christ cannot possibly subsist without society without our living and conversing with other men but is it not expedient however one might naturally ask to converse only with good men  only with those whom we know to be meek and merciful  holy of heart and holy of life is it not expedient to refrain from any conversation or intercourse with men of the opposite character  men who do not obey perhaps do not believe the gospel of our lord jesus christ the advice of st paul to   the christians at corinth may seem to favour this i wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators 1 cor 59 and it is certainly not advisable so to company with them or with any of the workers of iniquity as to have any particular familiarity or any strictness of friendship with them to contract or continue an intimacy with any such is no way expedient for a christian it must necessarily expose him to abundance of dangers and snares out of which he can have no reasonable hope of deliverance but the apostle does not forbid us to have any intercourse at all even with the men that know not god for then says he ye must needs go out of the world which he could never advise them to do but he subjoins if any man that is called a brother that professes himself a christian be a fornicator or covetous or an idolater or a railer or a drunkard or anextortioner 1 cor 511 now i have written unto you not to keep company with him with such an one no not to eat this must necessarily imply that we break off all familiarity all intimacy of acquaintance with him yet count him not saith the apostle elsewhere as an enemy but admonish him as a brother 2thes 315 plainly showing that even in such a case as this we are not to renounce all fellowship with him so that here is no advice to separate wholly even from wicked men yea these very words teach us quite the contrary  much more the words of our lord who is so far from directing us to break off all commerce with the world that without it according to his account of christianity we cannot be christians at all it would be easy to show that some intercourse even with ungodly and unholy men is absolutely needful in order to the full exertion of every temper which he has described as the way of the kingdom that it is indispensably necessary in order to the complete exercise of poverty of spirit of mourning and of every other disposition which has a place here in the genuine religion of jesus christ yea it is necessary to the very being of several of them of that meekness for example which instead of demanding an eye for an eye or a tooth for a tooth doth not resist evil but causes us rather when smitten on the right cheek to turn the other also  of that mercifulness whereby we love our enemies bless them that curse us do good to them that hate us and pray for them which despitefully use us and persecute us  and of that complication of love and all holy tempers which is exercised in suffering for righteousness sake now all these it is clear could have no being were we to have no commerce with any but real christians indeed were we wholly to separate ourselves from sinners how could we possibly answer that character which our lord gives us in these very words ye christians ye that are lowly serious and meek ye that hunger after righteousness that love god and man that do good to all and therefore suffer evil ye are the salt of the earth it is your very nature to season whatever is round about you it is the nature of the divine savour which is in you to spread to whatsoever you touch to diffuse itself on every side to all those among whom you are this is the great reason why the providence of god has so mingled you together with other men that whatever grace you have received of god may through you be communicated to others that every holy temper and word and work of yours may have an influence on lo them also by this means a check will in some measure be given to the corruption which is in the world and a small part at least saved from the general infection and rendered holy and pure before god that we may the more diligently labour to season all we can with every holy and heavenly temper our lord proceeds to show the desperate state of those who do not impart the religion they have received which indeed they cannot possibly fail to do so long as it remains in their own hearts if the salt have lost its savour wherewith shall it be salted it is thenceforth good for nothing but to be cast out and trodden under foot of men if ye who were holy and heavenlyminded and consequently zealous of good works have no longer that savour in yourselves and do therefore no longer season others if you are grown flat insipid dead both careless of your own soul and useless to the souls of other men wherewith shall ye be salted how shall ye be recovered what help what hope can tasteless salt be restored to its savour no it is thenceforth good for nothing but to be cast out even as the mire in the streets and to be trodden under foot of men to be overwhelmed with everlasting contempt if ye had never known the lord there might have been hope  if ye had never been found in him but what can you now say to that his solemn declaration just parallel to what he hath here spoken every branch in me thatbeareth not fruit he the father taketh away he that abideth in me and i in him bringeth forth much fruit if a man abide not in me or do not bring forth fruit   he is cast out as a branch and withered and men gather them not to plant them again but to cast them into the fire john 152 5 6 9 toward those who have never tasted of the good word god is indeed pitiful and of tender mercy but justice takes place with regard to those who have tasted that the lord is gracious and have afterwards turned back from the holy commandment then delivered to them for it is impossible for those who were once enlightened heb 64 c in whose hearts god had once shined to enlighten them with the knowledge of the glory of god in the face of jesus christ who have tasted of the heavenly gift of redemption in his blood the forgiveness of sins and were made partakers of the holy ghost of lowliness of meekness and of the love of god and man shed abroad in their hearts by the holy ghost which was given unto them and have fallen away  kaiparapesontas  here is not a supposition but a flat declaration of matter of fact to renew them again unto repentance seeing they crucify to themselves the son of god afresh and put him to an open shame but that none may misunderstand these awful words it should be carefully observed 1 who they are that are here spoken of namely they and they only who were once thus enlightened they only who did taste of that heavenly gift and were thus made partakers of the holy ghost so that all who have not experienced these things are wholly unconcerned in this scripture 2 what that falling away is which is here spoken of it is an absolute total apostasy a believer may fall and not fall away he may fall and rise again and if he should fall even into sin yet this case dreadful as it is is not desperate for we have an advocate with the father jesus christ the righteous and he is the propitiation for our sins but let him above all things beware lest his heart be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin lest he should sink lower and lower till he wholly fall away till he become as salt that hath lost its savour for if we thus sin wilfully after we have received the experimental knowledge of the truth there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins but a certain fearful looking for of fiery indignation which shall devour the adversaries ii 1 but although we may not wholly separate ourselves from mankind although it be granted we ought to season them with the religion which god has wrought in our hearts yet may not this be done insensibly may we not convey this into others in a secret and almost imperceptible manner so that scarce anyone shall be able to observe how or when it is done  even as salt conveys its own savour into that which is seasoned thereby without any noise and without being liable to any outward observation and if so although we do not go out of the world yet we may lie hid in it we may thus far keep our religion to ourselves and not offend lo those whom we cannot help 2 of this plausible reasoning of flesh and blood our lord was well aware also and he has given a full answer to it in those words which come now to be considered in explaining which i shall endeavour to show as i proposed to do in the second place that so long as true religion abides in our hearts it is impossible to conceal it as well as absolutely contrary to the design of its great author and first it is impossible for any that have it to conceal the religion of jesus christ this our lord makes plain beyond all contradiction by a twofold comparison ye are the light of the world a city set upon an hill cannot be hid ye christians are the light of the world with regard both to your tempers and actions your holiness makes you as conspicuous as the sun in the midst of heaven as ye cannot go out of the world so neither can ye stay in it without appearing to all mankind ye may not flee from men and while ye are among them it is impossible to hide your lowliness and meekness and those other dispositions whereby ye aspire to be perfect as your father which is in heaven is perfect love cannot be hid any more than light and least of all when it shines forth in action when ye exercise yourselves in the labour of love in beneficence of every kind as well may men think to hide a city as to hide a christian yea as well may they conceal a city set upon a hill as a holy zealous active lover of god and man  3 it is true men who love darkness rather than light because their deeds are evil will take all possible pains to prove that the light which is in you is darkness they will say evil all manner of evil falsely of the good which is in you they will lay to your charge that which is farthest from your thoughts which is the very reverse of all you are and all you do and your patient continuance in welldoing your meek suffering all things for the lords sake your calm humble joy in the midst of   persecution your unwearied labour to overcome evil with good will make you still more visible and conspicuous than ye were before so impossible it is to keep our religion from being seen unless we cast it away so vain is the thought of hiding the light unless by putting it out sure it is that a secret unobserved religion cannot be the religion of jesus christ whatever religion can be concealed is not christianity if a christian could be hid he could not be compared to a city set upon an hill to the light of the world the sun shining from heaven and seen by all the world below never therefore let it enter into the heart of him whom god hath renewed in the spirit of his mind to hide that light to keep his religion to himself especially considering it is not only impossible to conceal true christianity but likewise absolutely contrary to the design of the great author of it this plainly appears from the following words neither do men light a candle to put it under a bushel as if he had said as men do not light a candle only to cover and conceal it so neither does god enlighten any soul with his glorious knowledge and love to have it covered or concealed either by prudence falsely so called or shame or voluntary humility to have it hid either in a desert or in the world either by avoiding men or in conversing with them but they put it on a candlestick and it giveth light to all that are in the house in like manner it is the design of god that every christian should be in an open point of view that he may give light to all around that he may visibly express the religion of jesus christ thus hath god in all ages spoken to the world not only by precept but by example also he hath not left himself without witness in any nation where the sound of the gospel hath gone forth without a few who testified his truth by their lives as well as their words these have been as lights shining in a dark place and from time to time they have been the means of enlightening some of preserving a remnant a little seed which was counted unto the lord for a generation they have led a few poor sheep out of the darkness of the world and guided their feet into the way of peace one might imagine that where both scripture and the reason of things speak so clearly and expressly there could not be much advanced on the other side at least not with any appearance of truth but they who imagine thus know little of the depths of satan after all that scripture and reason have said so exceeding plausible are the pretences for solitary religion for a christians going out of the world or at least hiding himself in it that we need all the wisdom of god to see through the snare and all the power of god to escape it so many and strong are the objections which have been brought against being social open active christians iii 1 to answer these was the third thing which i proposed and first it has been often objected that religion does not lie in outward things but in the heart the inmost soul that it is the union of the soul with god the life of god in the soul of man that outside religion is nothing worth seeing god delighteth not in burntofferings in outward services but a pure and holy heart is the sacrifice he will not despise i answer it is most true that the root of religion lies in the heart in the inmost soul that this is the union of the soul with god the life of god in the soul of man but if this root be really in the heart it cannot but put forth branches and these are the several instances of outward obedience which partake of the same nature with the root and consequently are not only marks or signs but substantial parts of religion it is also true that bare outside religion which has no root in the heart is nothing worth that god delighteth not in such outward services no more than in jewish burntofferings and that a pure and holy heart is a sacrifice with which he is always well pleased but he is also well pleased with all that outward service which arises from the heart with the sacrifice of our prayers whether public or private of our praises and thanksgivings with the sacrifice of our goods humbly devoted to him and employed wholly to his glory and with that of our bodies which he peculiarly claims which the apostle beseeches us by the mercies of god to present unto him a living sacrifice holy acceptable to god   2 a second objection nearly related to this is that love is all in all that it is the fulfilling of the law the end of the commandment of every commandment of god that all we do and all we suffer if we have not charity or loveprofiteth us nothing and therefore the apostle directs us to follow after charity and terms this the more excellent way i answer it is granted that the love of god and man arising from faith unfeigned is all in all the fulfilling of the law the end of every commandment of god it is true that without this whatever we do whatever we suffer profits us nothing but it does not follow that love is all in such a sense as to supersede either faith or good works it is the fulfilling of the law not by releasing us from but by constraining us to obey it it is the end of the commandment as every commandment leads to and centres in it it is allowed that whatever we do or suffer without love profits us nothing but withal whatever we do or suffer in love though it were only the suffering reproach for christ or the giving a cup of cold water in his name it shall in no wise lose its reward 3 but does not the apostle direct us to follow after charity and does he not term it a more excellent way  he does direct us to follow after charity but not after that alone his words are follow after charity and desire spiritual gifts 1 cor 141 yea follow after charity and desire to spend and to be spent for your brethren follow after charity and as you have opportunity do good to all men in the same verse also wherein he terms this the way of love a more excellent way he directs the corinthians to desire other gifts besides it yea to desire them earnestly covet earnestly saith he the best gifts and yet i show unto you a more excellent way 1 cor 1231 more excellent than what than the gifts of healing of speaking with tongues and of interpreting mentioned in the preceding verse but not more excellent than the way of obedience of this the apostle is not speaking neither is he speaking of outward religion at all so that this text is quite wide of the present question  but suppose the apostle had been speaking of outward as well as inward religion and comparing them together suppose in the comparison he had given the preference ever so much to the latter suppose he had preferred as he justly might a loving heart before all outward works whatever yet it would not follow that we were to reject either one or the other no god hath joined them together from the beginning of the world and let not man put them asunder 4 but god is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth and is not this enough nay ought we not to employ the whole strength of our mind herein does not attending to outward things clog the soul that it cannot soar aloft in holy contemplation does it not damp the vigour of our thought has it not a natural tendency to encumber and distract the mind whereas st paul would have us to be without carefulness and to wait upon the lord without distraction  i answer god is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth yea and this is enough we ought to employ the whole strength of our mind therein but then i would ask what is it to worship god a spirit in spirit and in truth why it is to worship him with our spirit to worship him in that manner which none but spirits are capable of it is to believe in him as a wise just holy being of purer eyes than to behold iniquity and yet merciful gracious and longsuffering forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin casting all our sins behind his back and accepting us in the beloved it is to love him to delight in him to desire him with all our heart and mind and soul and strength to imitate him we love by purifying ourselves even as he is pure and to obey him whom we love and in whom we believe both in thought and word and work consequently one branch of the worshipping god in spirit and in truth is the keeping his outward commandments to glorify him therefore with our bodies as well as with our spirits to go through outward work with hearts lifted up to him to make our daily employment a sacrifice to god to buy and sell to eat and drink to his glory  this is worshipping god in spirit and in truth as much as the praying to him in a wilderness  5 but if so then contemplation is only one way of worshipping god in spirit and in truth therefore to give ourselves up entirely to this would be to destroy many branches of spiritual worship all   equally acceptable to god and equally profitable not hurtful to the soul for it is a great mistake to suppose that an attention to those outward things whereto the providence of god hath called us is any clog to a christian or any hindrance at all to his always seeing him that is invisible it does not at all damp the ardour of his thought it does not encumber or distract his mind it gives him no uneasy or hurtful care who does it all as unto the lord who hath learned whatsoever he doth in word or deed to do all in the name of the lord jesus having only one eye of the soul which moves round on outward things and one immovably fixed on god learn what thismeaneth ye poor recluses that you may clearly discern your own littleness of faith yea that you may no longer judge others by yourselves go and learn what thatmeaneth  thou o lord in tender love dost all my burdens bear lift my heart to things above and fix it ever there calm on tumults wheel i sit midst busy multitudes alone sweetly waiting at thy feet till all thy will he done 6 but the grand objection is still behind we appeal say they to experience our light did shine we used outward things many years and yet they profited nothing we attended on all the ordinances but we were no better for it nor indeed anyone else nay we were the worse for we fancied ourselves christians for so doing when we knew not what christianity meant i allow the fact i allow that you and ten thousand more have thus abused the ordinances of god mistaking the means for the end supposing that the doing these or some other outward works either was the religion of jesus christ or would be accepted in the place of it but let the abuse be taken away and the use remain now use all outward things but use them with a constant eye to the renewal of your soul in righteousness and true holiness 7 but this is not all they affirm experience likewise shows that the trying to do good is but lost labour what does it avail to feed or clothe mens bodies if they are just dropping into everlasting fire and what good can any man do to their souls if these are changed god doth it himself besides all men are either good at least desirous so to be or obstinately evil now the former have no need of us let them ask help of god and it shall be given them and the latter will receive no help from us nay and our lord forbids to cast our pearls before swine i answer 1 whether they will finally be lost or saved you are expressly commanded to feed the hungry and clothe the naked if you can and do not whatever becomes of them you shall go away into everlasting fire 2 though it is god only changes hearts yet he generally doth it by man it is our part to do all that in us lies as diligently as if we could change them ourselves and then to leave the event to him 3 god in answer to their prayers builds up his children by each other in every good gift nourishing and strengthening the whole body by that which every jointsupplieth so that the eye cannot say to the hand i have no need of thee no nor even the head to the feet i have no need of you lastly how are you assured that the persons before you are dogs or swine judge them not until you have tried howknowest thou o man but thou mayst gain thy brother  but thou mayst under god save his soul from death when he spurns thy love and blasphemes the good word then it is time to give him up to god 8 we have tried we have laboured to reform sinners and what did it avail on many we could make no impression at all and if some were changed for a while yet their goodness was but as the   morning dew and they were soon as bad nay worse than ever so that we only hurt them and ourselves too for our minds were hurried and discomposed  perhaps filled with anger instead of love therefore we had better have kept our religion to ourselves it is very possible this fact also may be true that you have tried to do good and have not succeeded yea that those who seemed reformed relapsed into sin and their last state was worse than the first and what marvel is the servant above his master but how often did he strive to save sinners and they would not hear or when they had followed him awhile they turned back as a dog to his vomit but he did not therefore desist from striving to do good no more should you whatever your success be it is your part to do as you are commanded the event is in the hand of god you are not accountable for this leave it to him who orders all things well in the morning sow thy seed and in the evening withhold not thy hand for thouknowest not whether shall prosper eccles 116 but the trial hurries and frets your own soul perhaps it did so for this very reason because you thought you was accountable for the event which no man is nor indeed can be  or perhaps because you was off your guard you was not watchful over your own spirit but this is no reason for disobeying god try again but try more warily than before do good as you forgive not seven times only but until seventy times seven only be wiser by experience attempt it every time more cautiously than before be more humbled before god more deeply convinced that of yourself you can do nothing be more jealous over your own spirit more gentle and watchful unto prayer thus cast your bread upon the waters and you shall find it again after many days iv 1 notwithstanding all these plausible pretences for hiding it let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven this is the practical application which our lord himself makes of the foregoing considerations let your light so shine  your lowliness of heart your gentleness and meekness of wisdom your serious weighty concern for the things of eternity and sorrow for the sins and miseries of men your earnest desire of universal holiness and full happiness in god your tender goodwill to all mankind and fervent love to your supreme benefactor endeavour not to conceal this light wherewith god hath enlightened your soul but let it shine before men before all with whom you are in the whole tenor of your conversation let it shine still more eminently in your actions in your doing all possible good to all men and in your suffering for righteousness sake while you rejoice and are exceeding glad knowing that great is your reward in heaven let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works  so far let a christian be from ever designing or desiring to conceal his religion on the contrary let it be your desire not to conceal it not to put the light under a bushel let it be your care to place it on a candlestick that it may give light to all that are in the house only take heed not to seek your own praise herein not to desire any honour to yourselves but let it be your sole aim that all who see your good works may glorify your father which is in heaven be this your one ultimate end in all things with this view be plain open undisguised let your love be without dissimulation why should you hide fair disinterested love let there be no guile found in your mouth let your words be the genuine picture of your heart let there be no darkness or reservedness in your conversation no disguise in your behaviour leave this to those who have other designs in view designs which will not bear the light be ye artless and simple to all mankind that all may see the grace of god which is in you and although some will harden their hearts yet others will take knowledge that ye have been with jesus and by returning themselves to the great bishop of their souls glorify your father which is in heaven with this one design that men may glorify god in you go on in his name and in the power of his might be not ashamed even to stand alone so it be in the ways of god let the light which is in your heart shine in all good works both works of piety and works of mercy and in order to enlarge your ability of doing good renounce all superfluities cut off all unnecessary expense in food in furniture in apparel be a good steward of every gift of god even of these his lowest gifts cut off all unnecessary expense of time all needless or uselessemployments and whatsoever thy handfindeth to do do it with thy might in a word be thou full of faith and love do good suffer evil and herein   be thou steadfast unmovable yea always abounding in the work of the lord forasmuch as thou knowest that thy labour is not in vain in the lord   sermon 25 text of the 1872 edition upon our lords sermon on the mount discourse 5 think not that i am come to destroy the law or the prophets i am not come to destroy but to fulfil for verily i say unto you till heaven and earth pass one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law till all be fulfilled whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments and shall teach men so he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven but whosoever shall do and teach them the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven for verily i say unto you that except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes andpharisees ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven matt 51720 among the multitude of reproaches which fell upon him who was despised and rejected of men it could not fail to be one that he was a teacher of novelties an introducer of a new religion this might be affirmed with the more colour because many of the expressions he had used were not common among the jews either they did not use them at all or not in the same sense not in so full and strong a meaning add to this that the worshipping god in spirit and in truth must always appear a new religion to those who have hitherto known nothing but outside worship nothing but the form of godliness and it is not improbable some might hope it was so that he was abolishing the old religion and bringing in another  one which they might flatter themselves would be an easier way to heaven but our lord refutes in these words both the vain hopes of the one and the groundless calumnies of the other i shall consider them in the same order as they lie taking each verse for a distinct head of discourse i 1 and first think not that i am come to destroy the law or the prophets i am not come to destroy but to fulfil the ritual or ceremonial law delivered bymoses to the children of israel containing all the injunctions and ordinances which related to the old sacrifices and service of the temple our lord indeed did come to destroy to dissolve and utterly abolish to this bear all the apostles witness not only barnabas and paul who vehemently withstood those who taught that christians ought to keep the law of moses acts 155 not only st peter who termed the insisting on this on the observance of the ritual law a tempting god and putting a yoke upon the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers saith he nor we were able to bear but all the apostles elders and brethren being assembled with one accord acts 1522 declared that to command them to keep this law was to subvert their souls and that it seemed good to the holy ghost and to them to lay no such burden upon them acts 1528 this handwriting of ordinances our lord did blot out take away and nail to his cross  2 but the moral law contained in the ten commandments and enforced by the prophets he did not take away it was not the design of his coming to revoke any part of this this is a law which never can be broken which stands fast as the faithful witness in heaven the moral stands on an entirely different foundation from the ceremonial or ritual law which was only designed for a temporary restraint upon a disobedient and stiffnecked people whereas this was from the beginning of the world being written not on tables of stone but on the hearts of all the children of men when they came out of the hands of the creator and however the letters once wrote by the finger of god are now in a great measure defaced by sin yet can they not wholly be blotted out while we have any consciousness of good and evil every part of this law must remain in force upon all mankind and in all ages as not depending either on time or place or any other circumstances liable to change but on the nature of god and the nature of man and their unchangeable relation to each other   i am not come to destroy but to fulfil some have conceived our lord to mean  i am come to fulfil this by my entire and perfect obedience to it and it cannot be doubted but he did in this sense fulfil every part of it but this does not appear to be what he intends here being foreign to the scope of his present discourse without question his meaning in this place is consistently with all that goes before and follows after  i am come to establish it in its fullness in spite of all the glosses of men i am come to place in a full and clear view whatsoever was dark or obscure therein i am come to declare the true and full import of every part of it to show the length and breadth the entire extent of every commandment contained therein and the height and depth the inconceivable purity and spirituality of it in all its branches and this our lord has abundantly performed in the preceding and subsequent parts of the discourse before us in which he has not introduced a new religion into the world but the same which was from the beginning  a religion the substance of which is without question as old as the creation being coeval with man and having proceeded from god at the very time when man became a living soul the substance i say for some circumstances of it now relate to man as a fallen creature  a religion witnessed to both by the law and by the prophets in all succeeding generations yet was it never so fully explained nor so thoroughly understood till the great author of it himself condescended to give mankind this authentic comment on all the essential branches of it at the same time declaring it should never be changed but remain in force to the end of the world ii 1 for verily i say unto you a solemn preface which denotes both the importance and certainty of what is spoken till heaven and earth pass one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law till all be fulfilled one jot  it is literally not one iota not the most inconsiderable vowel or one tittle mia keraia  one corner or point of a consonant it is a proverbial expression which signifies that no one commandment contained in the moral law nor the least part of any one however inconsiderable it might seem should ever be disannulled shall in no wise pass from the law ou me parelthei apo tou nomou the double negative here used strengthens the sense so as to admit of no contradiction and the word parelthei it may be observed is not barely future declaring what will be but has likewise the force of an imperative ordering what shall be it is a word of authority expressing the sovereign will and power of him that spake of him whose word is the law of heaven and earth and stands fast for ever and ever one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass till heaven and earth pass or as it is expressed immediately after hews an panta genetai  till all  or rather all things be fulfilled till the consummation of all things here is therefore no room for that poor evasion with which some have delighted themselves greatly that no part of the law was to pass away till all the law was fulfilled but it has been fulfilled by christ and therefore now must pass for the gospel to be established not so the word all does not mean all the law but all things in the universe as neither has the term fulfilled any reference to the law but to all things in heaven and earth from all this we may learn that there is no contrariety at all between the law and the gospel that there is no need for the law to pass away in order to the establishing of the gospel indeed neither of them supersedes the other but they agree perfectly well together yea the very same words considered in different respects are parts both of the law and of the gospel if they are considered as commandments they are parts of the law if as promises of the gospel thus thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart when considered as a commandment is a branch of the law when regarded as a promise is an essential part of the gospel  the gospel being no other than the commands of the law proposed by way of promises accordingly poverty of spirit purity of heart and whatever else is enjoined in the holy law of god are no other when viewed in a gospel light than so many great and precious promises  there is therefore the closest connexion that can be conceived between the law and the gospel on the one hand the law continually makes way for and points us to the gospel on the other the gospel continually leads us to a more exact fulfilling of the law the law for instance requires us to love   god to love our neighbour to be meek humble or holy we feel that we are not sufficient for these things yea that with man this is impossible but we see a promise of god to give us that love and to make us humble meek and holy we lay hold of this gospel of these glad tidings it is done unto us according to our faith and the righteousness of the law is fulfilled in us through faith which is in christ jesus we may yet farther observe that every command in holy writ is only a covered promise for by that solemn declaration this is the covenant i will make after those days saith the lord i will put my laws in your minds and write them in your hearts god hath engaged to give whatsoever he commands does he command us then to pray without ceasing to rejoice evermore to be holy as he is holy it is enough he will work in us this very thing it shall be unto us according to his word  4 but if these things are so we cannot be at a loss what to think of those who in all ages of the church have undertaken to change or supersede some commands of god as they professed by the peculiar direction of his spirit christ has here given us an infallible rule whereby to judge of all such pretensions christianity as it includes the whole moral law of god both by way of injunction and of promise if we will hear him is designed of god to be the last of all his dispensations there is no other to come after this this is to endure till the consummation of all things of consequence all such new revelations are of satan and not of god and all pretences to another more perfect dispensation fall to the ground of course heaven and earth shall pass away but this word shall not pass away  iii 1 whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments and shall teach men so he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven but whosoever shall do and teach them the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven who what are they that make the preaching of the law a character of reproach do they not see on whom their reproach must fall  on whose head it must light at last whosoever on this ground despiseth us despiseth him that sent us for did ever any man preach the law like him even when he came not to condemn but to save the world when he came purposely to bring life and immortality to light through the gospel can any preach the law more expressly more rigorously than christ does in these words and who is he that shall amend them who is he that shall instruct the son of god how to preach who will teach him a better way of delivering the message which he hath received of the father 2 whosoever shall break one of these least commandments or one of the least of these commandments  these commandments we may observe is a term used by our lord as equivalent with the law or the law and the prophets  which is the same thing seeing the prophets added nothing to the law but only declared explained or enforced it as they were moved by the holy ghost  whosoever shall break one of these least commandments especially if it be done wilfully or presumptuously  one  for he that keepeth the whole law and thus offends in one point is guilty of all the wrath of god abideth on him as surely as if he had broken every one so that no allowance is made for one darling lust no reserve for one idol no excuse for refraining from all besides and only giving way to one bosom sin what god demands is an entire obedience we are to have an eye to all his commandments otherwise we lose all the labour we take in keeping some and our poor souls for ever and ever  one of these least or one of the least of these commandments  here is another excuse cut off whereby many who cannot deceive god miserably deceive their own souls this sin saith the sinner is it not a little one will not the lord spare me in this thing surely he will not be extreme to mark this since i do not offend in the greater matters of the law vain hope speaking after the   manner of men we may term these great and those little commandments but in reality they are not so if we use propriety of speech there is no such thing as a little sin every sin being a transgression of the holy and perfect law and an affront on the great majesty of heaven 3 and shall teach men so in some sense it may be said that whosoever openly breaks any commandment teaches others the same for example speaks and many times louder than precept in this sense it is apparent every open drunkard is a teacher of drunkenness everysabbathbreaker is constantly teaching his neighbour to profane the day of the lord but this is not all an habitual breaker of the law is seldom content to stop here he generally teaches other men to do so too by word as well as example especially when he hardens his neck andhateth to be reproved such a sinner soon commences an advocate for sin he defends what he is resolved not to forsake he excuses the sin which he will not leave and thus directly teaches every sin which he commits he shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven  that is shall have no part therein he is a stranger to the kingdom of heaven which is on earth he hath no portion in that inheritance no share of that righteousness and peace and joy in the holy ghost nor by consequence can he have any part in the glory which shall be revealed but if those who even thus break and teach others to break one of the least of these commandments shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven shall have no part in the kingdom of christ and of god if even these shall be cast into outer darkness where is wailing and gnashing of teeth then where will they appear whom our lord chiefly and primarily intends in these words  they who bearing the character of teachers sent from god do nevertheless themselves break his commandments yea and openly teach others so to do being corrupt both in life and doctrine these are of several sorts of the first sort are they who live in some wilful habitual sin now if an ordinary sinner teaches by his example how much more a sinful minister  even if he does not attempt to defend excuse or extenuate his sin if he does he is a murderer indeed yea the murderergeneral of his congregation he peoples the regions of death he is the choicest instrument of the prince of darkness when he goes hence hell from beneath is moved to meet him at his coming nor can he sink into the bottomless pit without dragging a multitude after him next to these are the goodnatured good sort of men who live an easy harmless life neither troubling themselves with outward sin nor with inward holiness men who are remarkable neither one way nor the other neither for religion nor irreligion who are very regular both in public and private but do not pretend to be any stricter than their neighbours a minister of this kind breaks not one or a few only of the least commandments of god but all the great and weighty branches of his law which relate to the power of godliness and all that require us to pass the time of our sojourning in fear to work out our salvation with fear and trembling to have our loins always girt and our lights burning to strive or agonize to enter in at the strait gate and he teaches men so by the whole form of his life and the general tenor of his preaching which uniformly tends to soothe those in their pleasing dream who imagine themselves christians and are not to persuade all who attend upon his ministry to sleep on and take their rest no marvel therefore if both he and they that follow him wake together in everlasting burnings but above all these in the highest rank of the enemies of the gospel of christ are they who openly and explicitly judge the law itself and speak evil of the law who teach men to break lysai to dissolve to loose to untie the obligation of not one only whether of the least or of the greatest but all the commandments at a stroke who teach without any cover in so many words  what did our lord do with the law he abolished it there is but one duty which is that of believing all commands are unfit for our times from any demand of the law no man is obliged now to go one step to give away one farthing to eat or omit one morsel this is indeed carrying matters with a high hand this is withstanding our lord to the face and telling him that he understood not how to deliver the message on which he was sent o lord lay not this sin to their charge father forgive them for they know not what they do the most surprising of all the circumstances that attend this strong delusion is that they who are given up to it really believe that they honour christ by overthrowing his law and that they are   magnifying his office while they are destroying his doctrine yea they honour him just asjudas did when he said hail master and kissed him and he may as justly say to every one of them betrayest thou the son of man with a kiss it is no other than betraying him with a kiss to talk of his blood and take away his crown to set light by any part of his law under pretence of advancing his gospel nor indeed can anyone escape this charge who preaches faith in any such manner as either directly or indirectly tends to set aside any branch of obedience who preaches christ so as to disannul or weaken in anywise the least of the commandments of god 9 it is impossible indeed to have too high an esteem for the faith of gods elect and we must all declare by grace ye are saved through faith not of works lest any man should boast we must cry aloud to every penitent sinner believe in the lord jesus christ and thou shalt be saved but at the same time we must take care to let all men know we esteem no faith but that whichworketh by love gal 56 and that we are not saved by faith unless so far as we are delivered from the power as well as the guilt of sin and when we say believe and thou shalt be saved we do not mean believe and thou shalt step from sin to heaven without any holiness coming between faith supplying the place of holiness but believe and thou shalt be holy believe in the lord jesus and thou shalt have peace and power together thou shalt have power from him in whom thoubelievest to trample sin under thy feet power to love the lord thy god with all thy heart and to serve him with all thy strength thou shalt have power by patient continuance in welldoing to seek for glory and honour and immortality thou shalt both do and teach all the commandments of god from the least even to the greatest thou shalt teach them by thy life as well as thy words and so be called great in the kingdom of heaven  iv 1 whatever other way we teach to the kingdom of heaven to glory honour and immortality be it called the way of faith or by any other name it is in truth the way to destruction it will not bring a man peace at the last for thus saith the lord verily i say unto you that except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes andpharisees ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven the scribes mentioned so often in the new testament as some of the most constant and vehement opposers of our lord were not secretaries or men employed in writing only as that term might incline us to believe neither were they lawyers in our common sense of the word although the word nomikoi is so rendered in our translation their employment had no affinity at all to that of a lawyer among us they were conversant with the laws of god and not with the laws of man these were their study it was their proper and peculiar business to read and expound the law and the prophets particularly in the synagogues they were the ordinary stated preachers among the jews so that if the sense of the original word was attended to we might render it the divines for these were the men who made divinity their profession and they were generally as their name literally imports men of letters men of the greatest account for learning that were then in the jewish nation 2 the pharisees were a very ancient sect or body of men among the jews originally so called from the hebrew word prs  which signifies to separate or divide not that they made any formal separation from or division in the national church they were only distinguished from others by greater strictness of life by more exactness of conversation for they were zealous of the law in the minutest points paying tithes of mint anise andcummin and hence they were had in honour of all the people and generally esteemed the holiest of men many of the scribes were of the sect of thepharisees thus st paul himself who was educated for a scribe first at the university of tarsus and after that in jerusalem at the feet ofgamaliel one of the most learned scribes or doctors of the law that were then in the nation declares of himself before the council i am a pharisee the son of a pharisee acts 236 and before kingagrippa after the straitest sect of our religion i lived a pharisee acts 265 and the whole body of the scribes generally esteemed and acted in concert with thepharisees hence we find our saviour so frequently coupling them together as coming in many respects under the same consideration in this place they seem to be mentioned together as the most eminent professors of religion the former of whom were accounted the wisest  the latter the holiest of men   3 what the righteousness of the scribes andpharisees really was it is not difficult to determine our lord has preserved an authentic account which one of them gave of himself and he is clear and full in describing his own righteousness and cannot be supposed to have omitted any part of it he went up indeed into the temple to pray but was so intent upon his own virtues that he forgot the design upon which he came for it is remarkable he does not properly pray at all he only tells god how wise and good he was god i thank thee that i am not as other men areextortioners unjust adulterers or even as this publican i fast twice in the week i give tithes of all that i possess his righteousness therefore consisted of three parts first saith he i am not as other men are i am not an extortioner not unjust not an adulterer not even as this publican secondly i fast twice in the week and thirdly i give tithes of all that i possess i am not as other men are this is not a small point it is not every man that can say this it is as if he had said  i do not suffer myself to be carried away by that great torrent custom i live not by custom but by reason not by the examples of men but the word of god i am not anextortioner not unjust not an adulterer however common these sins are even among those who are called the people of god extortion in particular  a kind of legal injustice not punishable by any human law the making gain of anothers ignorance or necessity having filled every corner of the land nor even as this publican not guilty of any open or presumptuous sin not an outward sinner but a fair honest man of blameless life and conversation i fast twice in the week there is more implied in this than we may at first be sensible of all the stricter pharisees observed the weekly fasts namely every monday and thursday on the former day they fasted in memory ofmoses receiving on that day as their tradition taught the two tables of stone written by the finger of god on the latter in memory of his casting them out of his hand when he saw the people dancing round the golden calf on these days they took no sustenance at all till three in the afternoon the hour at which they began to offer up the evening sacrifice in the temple till that hour it was their custom to remain in the temple in some of the corners apartments or courts thereof that they might be ready to assist at all the sacrifices and to join in all the public prayers the time between they were accustomed to employ partly in private addresses to god partly in searching the scriptures in reading the law and the prophets and in meditating thereon thus much is implied in i fast twice in the week the second branch of the righteousness of pharisee i give tithes of all that i possess this thepharisees did with the utmost exactness they would not except the most inconsiderable thing no not mint anise andcummin they would not keep back the least part of what they believed properly to belong to god but gave a full tenth of their whole substance yearly and of all their increase whatsoever it was yea the stricter pharisees as has been often observed by those who are versed in the ancient jewish writings not content with giving one tenth of their substance to god in his priests andlevites gave another tenth to god in the poor and that continually they gave the same proportion of all they had in alms as they were accustomed to give in tithes and this likewise theyajusted with the utmost exactness that they might not keep back any part but might fully render unto god the things which were gods as they accounted this to be so that upon the whole they gave away from year to year an entire fifth of all that they possessed 6 this was the righteousness of the scribes andpharisees a righteousness which in many respects went far beyond the conception which many have been accustomed to entertain concerning it but perhaps it will be said it was all false and feigned for they were all a company of hypocrites some of them doubtless were men who had really no religion at all no fear of god or desire to please him who had no concern for the honour thatcometh of god but only for the praise of men and these are they whom our lord so severely condemns so sharply reproves on many occasions but we must not suppose because manypharisees were hypocrites therefore all were so nor indeed is hypocrisy by any means essential to the character of a pharisee this is not the distinguishing mark of their sect it is rather this according to our lords account they trusted in themselves that they were righteous and despised others this is their genuine badge but thepharisee of this kind cannot be a hypocrite he must be in the common sense sincere otherwise he could not trust in himself that he is righteous the man who was here commending himself to god unquestionably thought himself   righteous consequently he was no hypocrite he was not conscious to himself of any insincerity he now spoke to god just what he thought namely that he was abundantly better than other men but the example of st paul were there no other is sufficient to put this out of all question he could not only say when he was a christian herein do i exercise myself to have always a conscience void of offence toward god and toward men acts 2416 but even concerning the time when he was a pharisee men and brethren i have lived in all good conscience before god until this day acts 231 he was therefore sincere when he was apharisee as well when he was a christian he was no more a hypocrite when he persecuted the church than when he preached the faith which once he persecuted let this then be added to the righteousness of the scribes andpharisees  a sincere belief that they are righteous and in all things doing god service 7 and yet except your righteousness saith our lord shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and pharisees ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven a solemn and weighty declaration and which it behoves all who are called by the name of christ seriously and deeply to consider but before we inquire how our righteousness may exceed theirs let us examine whether at present we come up to it first a pharisee was not as other men are in externals he was singularly good are we so do we dare to be singular at all do we not rather swim with the stream do we not many times dispense with religion and reason together because we would not look particular are we not often more afraid of being out of the fashion than of being out of the way of salvation have we courage to stem the tide  to run counter to the world  to obey god rather than man otherwise thepharisee leaves us behind at the very first step it is well if we overtake him any more but to come closer can we use his first plea with god which is in substance i do no harm i live in no outward sin i do nothing for which my own heart condemns me do you not are you sure of that do you live in no practice for which your own heart condemns you if you are not an adulterer if you are not unchaste either in word or deed are you not unjust the grand measure of justice as well as of mercy is do unto others as thou wouldst they should do unto thee do you walk by this rule do you never do unto any what you would not they should do unto you nay are you not grossly unjust are you not an extortioner do you not make a gain of anyones ignorance or necessity neither in buying nor selling suppose you are engaged in trade do you demand do you receive no more than the real value of what you sell do you demand do you receive no more of the ignorant than of the knowing  of a little child than of an experienced trader if you do why does not your heart condemn you you are a barefacedextortioner do you demand no more than the usual price of goods of any who is in pressing want  who must have and that without delay the things which you only can furnish him with if you do this also is flat extortion indeed you do not come up to the righteousness of a pharisee 8 a pharisee secondly to express his sense in our common way used all the means of grace as he fasted often and much twice in every week so he attended all the sacrifices he was constant in public and private prayer and in reading and hearing the scriptures do you go as far as this do you fast much and often  twice in the week i fear not once at least on all fridays in the year so our church clearly and peremptorily enjoins all her members to do to observe all these as well as the vigils and the forty days of lent as days of fasting or abstinence do you fast twice in the year i am afraid some among us cannot plead even this do you neglect no opportunity of attending and partaking of the christian sacrifice how many are they who call themselves christians and yet are utterly regardless of it  yet do not eat of that bread or drink of that cup for months perhaps years together do you every day either hear the scriptures or read them and meditate thereon do you join in prayer with the great congregation daily if you have opportunity if not whenever you can particularly on that day which you remember to keep it holy do you strive to make opportunities are you glad when they say unto you we will go into the house of the lord are you zealous of and diligent in private prayer do you suffer no day to pass without it rather are not some of you so far from spending therein with the pharisee several hours in one day that you think one hour full enough if not too much do you spend an hour in a day or in a week in praying to your father which is in secret yea an hour in a month have you spent one hour together in private prayer ever   since you was born ah poor christian shall not thepharisee rise up in the judgment against thee and condemn thee his righteousness is as far above thine as the heaven is above the earth the pharisee thirdly paid tithes and gave alms of all that he possessed and in how ample a manner so that he was as we phrase it a man that did much good do we come up to him here which of us is so abundant as he was in good works which of us gives a fifth of all his substance to god both of the principal and of the increase who of us out of suppose an hundred pounds a year gives twenty to god and the poor out of fifty ten and so in a larger or a smaller proportion when shall our righteousness in using all the means of grace in attending all the ordinances of god in avoiding evil and doing good equal at least the righteousness of the scribes andpharisees although if it only equalled theirs what would that profit for verily i say unto you except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes andpharisees ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven but how can it exceed theirs wherein does the righteousness of a christian exceed that of a scribe or pharisee christian righteousness exceeds theirs first in the extent of it most of thepharisees though they were rigorously exact in many things yet were emboldened by the traditions of the elders to dispense with others of equal importance thus they were extremely punctual in keeping the fourth commandment  they would not even rub an ear of corn on the sabbathday but not at all in keeping the third  making little account of light or even false swearing so that their righteousness was partial whereas the righteousness of a real christian is universal he does not observe one or some parts of the law of god and neglect the rest but keeps all his commandments loves them all values them above gold or precious stones it may be indeed that some of the scribes andpharisees endeavoured to keep all the commandments and consequently were as touching the righteousness of the law that is according to the letter of it blameless but still the righteousness of a christian exceeds all this righteousness of a scribe or pharisee by fulfilling the spirit as well as the letter of the law by inward as well as outward obedience in this in the spirituality of it it admits of no comparison this is the point which our lord has so largely proved in the whole tenor of this discourse their righteousness was external only christian righteousness is in the inner man the pharisee cleansed the outside of the cup and the platter the christian is clean within the pharisee laboured to present god with a good life the christian with a holy heart the one shook off the leaves perhaps the fruits of sin the other lays the axe to the root as not being content with the outward form of godliness how exact soever it be unless the life the spirit the power of god unto salvation be felt in the inmost soul thus to do no harm to do good to attend the ordinances of god the righteousness of pharisee are all external whereas on the contrary poverty of spirit mourning meekness hunger and thirst after righteousness the love of our neighbour and purity of heart the righteousness of a christian are all internal and even peacemaking or doing good and suffering for righteousness sake stand entitled to the blessings annexed to them only as they imply these inward dispositions as they spring from exercise and confirm them so that whereas the righteousness of the scribes andpharisees was external only it may be said in some sense that the righteousness of a christian is internal only all his actions and sufferings being as nothing in themselves being estimated before god only by the tempers from which they spring 12 whosoever therefore thou art whobearest the holy and venerable name of a christian see first that thy righteousness fall not short of the righteousness of the scribes andpharisees be not thou as other men are dare to stand alone to be against example singularly good if thou follow a multitude at all it must be to do evil let not custom or fashion be thy guide but reason and religion the practice of others is nothing to thee every man must give an account of himself to god indeed if thou canst save the soul of another do but at least save one  thy own walk not in the path of death because it is broad and many walk therein nay by this very token thou mayst know it is the way wherein thou nowwalkest a broad wellfrequented fashionable way then it infallibly leads to destruction o be not thou damned for company cease from evil fly from sin as from the face of a serpent at least do no harm he thatcommitteth sin is of the devil be not thou found in that number touching outward sins surely the grace of god is even now sufficient for thee herein at least exercise thyself to have a conscience void of offence toward god and toward men   secondly let not thy righteousness fall short of theirs with regard to the ordinances of god if thy labour or bodily strength will not allow of thy fasting twice in the week however deal faithfully with thy own soul and fast as often as thy strength will permit omit no public no private opportunity of pouring out thy soul in prayer neglect no occasion of eating that bread and drinking that cup which is the communion of the body and blood of christ be diligent in searching the scriptures read as thou mayst and meditate therein day and night rejoice to embrace every opportunity of hearing the word of reconciliation declared by the ambassadors of christ the stewards of the mysteries of god in using all the means of grace in a constant and careful attendance on every ordinance of god live up to at least till thou canst go beyond the righteousness of the scribes andpharisees thirdly fall not short of a pharisee in doing good give alms of all thou dost possess is any hungry feed him is he athirst give him drink naked cover him with a garment if thou hast this worlds goods do not limit thy beneficence to a scanty proportion be merciful to the uttermost of thy power why not even as this pharisee now make thyself friends while the time is of the mammon of unrighteousness that when thou failest when this earthly tabernacle is dissolved they may receive thee into everlasting habitations 13 but rest not here let thy righteousness exceed the righteousness of the scribes andpharisees be not thou content to keep the whole law and offend in one point hold thou fast all his commandments and all false ways do thou utterly abhor do all the things whatsoever he hath commanded and that with all thy might thou canst do all things through christ strengthening thee though without him thou canst do nothing above all let thy righteousness exceed theirs in the purity and spirituality of it what is the exactest form of religion to thee the most perfect outside righteousness go thou higher and deeper than all this let thy religion be the religion of the heart be thou poor in spirit little and base and mean and vile in thy own eyes amazed and humbled to the dust at the love of god which is in christ jesus thy lord be serious let the whole stream of thy thoughts words and works be such as flows from the deepest conviction that thoustandest on the edge of the great gulf thou and all the children of men just ready to drop in either into everlasting glory or everlasting burnings be meek let thy soul be filled with mildness gentleness patience longsuffering toward all men at the same time that all which is in thee is athirst for god the living god longing to awake up after his likeness and to be satisfied with it be thou a lover of god and of all mankind in this spirit do and suffer all things thus exceed the righteousness of the scribes andpharisees and thou shalt be called great in the kingdom of heaven   sermon 26 text of the 1872 ed upon our lords sermon on the mount discourse 6 take heed that ye do not your alms before men to be seen of them otherwise ye have no reward of your father which is in heaven therefore when thou doest thine alms do not sound a trumpet before thee as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets that they may have glory of men verily i say unto you they have their reward but when thou doest alms let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth that thine alms may be in secret and thy father whichseeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly and when thou prayest thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets that they may be seen of men verily i say unto you they have their reward but thou when thou prayest enter into thy closet and when thou hast shut thy door pray to thy father which is in secret and thy father whichseeth in secret he shall reward thee openly but when ye pray use not vain repetitions as the heathen do for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking be not ye therefore like unto them for your fatherknoweth what things ye have need of before you ask him after this manner therefore pray ye our father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory for ever amen for if ye forgive men their trespasses your heavenly father will also forgive you but if ye forgive not men their trespasses neither will your father forgive your trespasses matt 6115 in the preceding chapter our lord has described inward religion in its various branches he has laid before us those dispositions of soul which constitute real christianity the inward tempers contained in that holiness without which no man shall see the lord the affections which when flowing from their proper fountain from a living faith in god through christ jesus are intrinsically and essentially good and acceptable to god he proceeds to show in this chapter how all our actions likewise even those that are indifferent in their own nature may be made holy and good and acceptable to god by a pure and holy intention whatever is done without this he largely declares is of no value before god whereas whatever outward works are thus consecrated to god they are in his sight of great price  the necessity of this purity of intention he shows first with regard to those which are usually accounted religious actions and indeed are such when performed with a right intention some of these are commonly termed works of piety the rest works of charity or mercy of the latter sort he particularly names almsgiving of the former prayer and fasting but the directions given for these are equally to be applied to every work whether of charity or mercy i 1 and first with regard to works of mercy take heed saithhethat ye do not your alms before men to be seen of them otherwise ye have no reward of your father which is in heaven that ye do not your alms  although this only is named yet is every work of charity included every thing which we give or speak or do whereby our neighbour may be profited whereby another man may receive any advantage either in his body or soul the feeding the hungry the clothing the naked the   entertaining or assisting the stranger the visiting those that are sick or in prison the comforting the afflicted the instructing the ignorant the reproving the wicked the exhorting and encouraging the welldoer and if there be any other work of mercy it is equally included in this direction take heed that ye do not your alms before men to be seen of them  the thing which is here forbidden is not barely the doing good in the sight of men this circumstance alone that others see what we do makes the action neither worse nor better but the doing it before men to be seen of them with this view from this intention only i say from this intention only for this may in some cases be a part of our intention we may design that some of our actions should be seen and yet they may be acceptable to god we may intend that our light should shine before men when our conscience bears us witness in the holy ghost that our ultimate end in designing they should see our good works is that they may glorify our father which is in heaven but take heed that ye do not the least thing with a view to your own glory take heed that a regard to the praise of men have no place at all in your works of mercy if ye seek your own glory if you have any design to gain the honour that cometh of men whatever is done with this view is nothing worth it is not done unto the lord he accepteth it not ye have no reward for this of our father which is in heaven therefore when thou doest thine alms do not sound a trumpet before thee as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets that they may have praise of men  the word synagogue does not here mean a place of worship but any place of public resort such as the marketplace or exchange it was a common thing among the jews who were men of large fortunes particularly among the pharisees to cause a trumpet to be sounded before them in the most public parts of the city when they were about to give any considerable alms the pretended reason for this was to call the poor together to receive it but the real design that they might have praise of men but be not thou like unto them do not thou cause a trumpet to be sounded before thee use no ostentation in doing good aim at the honour which cometh of god only they who seek the praise of men have their reward they shall have no praise of god  but when thou doest alms let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth  this is a proverbial expression the meaning of which is  do it in as secret a manner as is possible as secret as is consistent with the doing it at all for it must not be left undone omit no opportunity of doing good whether secretly or openly and with the doing it in the most effectual manner for here is also an exception to be made when you are fully persuaded in your own mind that by your not concealing the good which is done either you will yourself be enabled or others excited to do the more good then you may not conceal it then let your light appear and shine to all that are in the house but unless where the glory of god and the good of mankind oblige you to the contrary act in as private and unobserved a manner as the nature of the thing will admit  that thy alms may be in secret and thy father which seeth in secret he shall reward thee openly perhaps in the present world  many instances of this stand recorded in all ages but infallibly in the world to come before the general assembly of men and angels  ii 1 from works of charity or mercy our lord proceeds to those which are termed works of piety and when thou prayest saith he thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets that they may be seen of men  thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are hypocrisy then or insincerity is the first thing we are to guard against in prayer beware not to speak what thou dost not mean prayer is the lifting up of the heart to god all words of prayer without this are mere hypocrisy whenever therefore thouattemptest to pray see that it be thy one design to commune with god to lift up thy heart to him to pour out thy soul before him not as the hypocrites who love or are wont to pray standing in the synagogues the exchange or marketplaces and in the corners of the streets wherever the most people are that they may be seen of men this was the sole design the motive and end of the prayers which they there repeated verily i say unto you they have their reward  they are to expect none from your father which is in heaven  2 but it is not only the having an eye to the praise of men which cuts us off from any reward in heaven which leaves us no room to expect the blessing of god upon our works whether of piety or mercy purity of intention is equally destroyed by a view to any temporal reward whatever if we repeat our prayers if we attend the public worship of god if we relieve the poor with a view to gain   or interest it is not a whit more acceptable to god than if it were done with a view to praise any temporal view any motive whatever on this side eternity any design but that of promoting the glory of god and the happiness of men for gods sake makes every action however fair it may appear to men an abomination unto the lord but when thou prayest enter into thy closet and when thou hast shut the door pray to thy father which is in secret  there is a time when thou art openly to glorify god to pray and praise him in the great congregation but when thoudesirest more largely and more particularly to make thy requests known unto god whether it be in the evening or in the morning or at noonday enter into thy closet and shut the door use all the privacy thou canst only leave it not undone whether thou hast any closet any privacy or no pray to god if it be possible when noneseeth but he but if otherwise pray to god thus pray to thy father which is in secret pour out thy heart before him and thy father which seeth in secret he shall reward thee openly but when ye pray even in secret use not vain repetitions as the heathen dome battalogesete do not use abundance of words without any meaning say not the same thing over and over again think not the fruit of your prayers depends on the length of them like the heathens for they think they shall be heard for their much speaking the thing here reproved is not simply the length any more than the shortness of our prayers  but first length without meaning speaking much and meaning little or nothing the using not all repetitions for our lord himself prayed thrice repeating the same words but vain repetitions as the heathens did reciting the names of their gods over and over as they do among christians vulgarly so called and not among the papists only who say over and over the same string of prayers without ever feeling what they speak  secondly the thinking to be heard for our much speaking the fancying god measures prayers by their length and is best pleased with those which contain the most words which sound the longest in his ears these are such instances of superstition and folly as all who are named by the name of christ should leave to the heathens to them on whom the glorious light of the gospel hath never shined 5 be not ye therefore like unto them  ye who have tasted of the grace of god in christ jesus are throughly convinced your fatherknoweth what things ye have need of before ye ask him so that the end of your praying is not to inform god as though he knew not your wants already but rather to inform yourselves to fix the sense of those wants more deeply in your hearts and the sense of your continual dependence on him who only is able to supply all your wants it is not so much to move god who is always more ready to give than you to ask as to move yourselves that you may be willing and ready to receive the good things he has prepared for you iii 1 after having taught the true nature and ends of prayer our lord subjoins an example of it even that divine form of prayer which seems in this place to be proposed by way of pattern chiefly as the model and standard of all our prayers after this manner therefore pray ye whereas elsewhere he enjoins the use of these very words he said unto them when ye pray say  luke 112 we may observe in general concerning this divine prayer first that it contains all we can reasonably or innocently pray for there is nothing which we have need to ask of god nothing which we can ask without offending him which is not included either directly or indirectly in this comprehensive form secondly that it contains all we can reasonably or innocently desire whatever is for the glory of god whatever is needful or profitable not only for ourselves but for every creature in heaven and earth and indeed our prayers are the proper test of our desires nothing being fit to have a place in our desires which is not fit to have a place in our prayers what we may not pray for neither should we desire thirdly that it contains all our duty to god and man whatsoever things are pure and holy whatsoever god requires of the children of men whatsoever is acceptable in his sight whatsoever it is whereby we may profit our neighbour being expressed or implied therein it consists of three parts  the preface the petitions and the doxology or conclusion the preface our father which art in heaven lays a general foundation for prayer comprising what we must first know of god before we can pray in confidence of being heard it likewise points out to us all those   tempers with which we are to approach to god which are most essentially requisite if we desire either our prayers or our lives should find acceptance with him 4 our father  if he is a father then he is good then he is loving to his children and here is the first and great reason for prayer god is willing to bless let us ask for a blessing our father  our creator the author of our being he who raised us from the dust of the earth who breathed into us the breath of life and we became living souls but if he made us let us ask and he will not withhold any good thing from the work of his own hands our father  our preserver who day by day sustains the life he has given of whose continuing love we now and every moment receive life and breath and all things so much the more boldly let us come to him and we shall obtain mercy and grace to help in time of need above all the father of our lord jesus christ and of all that believe in him who justifies us freely by his grace through the redemption that is in jesus who hath blotted out all our sins and healed all our infirmities who hath received us for his own children by adoption and grace and because we are sons hath sent forth the spirit of his son into our hearts crying abba father who hath begotten us again of incorruptible seed and created us anew in christ jesus therefore we know that heheareth us always therefore we pray to him without ceasing we pray because we love and we love him because he first loved us 5  our father  not mine only who now cry unto him but ours in the most extensive sense the god and father of the spirits of all flesh the father of angels and men so the very heathens acknowledged him to be pater te theon te the father of the universe of all the families both in heaven and earth therefore with him there is no respect of persons heloveth all that he hath made he is loving unto every man and his mercy is over all his works and the lords delight is in them that fear him and put their trust in his mercy in them that trust in him through the son of his love knowing they are accepted in the beloved but if god so loved us we ought also to love one another yea all mankind seeing god so loved the world that he gave his onlybegotten son even to die the death that they might not perish but have everlasting life 6 which art in heaven  high and lifted up god over all blessed for ever who sitting on the circle of the heavens beholdeth all things both in heaven and earth whose eye pervades the whole sphere of created being yea and of uncreated night unto whom are known all his works and all the works of every creature not only from the beginning of the world a poor low weak translation but ap aionos from all eternity from everlasting to everlasting who constrains the host of heaven as well as the children of men to cry out with wonder and amazement o the depth the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and of the knowledge of god which art in heaven  the lord and ruler of all superintending and disposing all things who art the king of kings and lord of lords the blessed and only potentate who art strong and girded about with power doing whatsoever pleaseth thee the almighty for whensoever thouwillest to do is present with thee in heaven  eminently there heaven is thy throne the place where thine honour particularly dwelleth but not there alone for thoufillest heaven and earth the whole expanse of space heaven and earth are full of thy glory glory be to thee o lord most high therefore should we serve the lord with fear and rejoice unto him with reverence therefore should we think speak and act as continually under the eye in the immediate presence of the lord the king  7 hallowed be thy name  this is the first of the six petitions whereof the prayer itself is composed the name of god is god himself the nature of god so far as it can be discovered to man it means therefore together with his existence all his attributes orperfections his eternity particularly signified by his great and incommunicable name jehovah as the apostle john translates it to a kai to o arche kai telos oon kai ho on kai ho en kai ho erchomenos  the alpha and omega the beginning and the end he which is and which was and which is to come  his fullness of being denoted by his other great name i am that i am  his omnipresence  his omnipotence who is indeed the only agent in the material world all matter being essentially dull and inactive and moving only as it is moved by the finger of god and he is the spring of action in every creature visible and invisible which could neither act nor exist without the continual influx and agency of his almighty power  his wisdom clearly deduced from the things that are seen from the goodly order of the universe  his trinity in unity and unity in trinity discovered to us in the   very first line of his written word bara elohim  literally the gods created a plural noun joined with a verb of the singular number as well as in every part of his subsequent revelations given by the mouth of all his holy prophets and apostles  his essential purity and holiness  and above all his love which is the very brightness of his glory in praying that god or his name may be hallowed or glorified we pray that he may be known such as he is by all that are capable thereof by all intelligent beings and with affections suitable to that knowledge that he may be duly honoured and feared and loved by all in heaven above and in the earth beneath by all angels and men whom for that end he has made capable of knowing and loving him to eternity 8 thy kingdom come  this has a closeconnexion with the preceding petition in order that the name of god might be hallowed we pray that his kingdom the kingdom of christ may come this kingdom then comes to a particular person when he repents and believes the gospel when he is taught of god not only to know himself but to know jesus christ and him crucified as this is life eternal to know the only true god and jesus christ whom he hath sent so it is the kingdom of god begun below set up in the believers heart the lord god omnipotent thenreigneth when he is known through christ jesus hetaketh unto himself his mighty power that he may subdue all things unto himself he goeth on in the soul conquering and to conquer till he hath put all things under his feet till every thought is brought into captivity to the obedience of christ when therefore god shall give his son the heathen for his inheritance and the uttermost parts of the earth for his possession when all kingdoms shall bow before him and all nations shall do him service when the mountain of the lords house the church of christ shall be established in the top of the mountains when the fullness of the gentiles shall come in and all israel shall be saved then shall it be seen that the lord is king and hath put on glorious apparel appearing to every soul of man as king of kings and lord of lords and it is meet for all those who love his appearing to pray that he would hasten the time that this his kingdom the kingdom of grace may come quickly and swallow up all the kingdoms of the earth that all mankind receiving him for their king truly believing in his name may be filled with righteousness and peace and joy with holiness and happiness  till they are removed hence into his heavenly kingdom there to reign with him for ever and ever  for this also we pray in those words thy kingdom come we pray for the coming of his everlasting kingdom the kingdom of glory in heaven which is the continuation and perfection of the kingdom of grace on earth consequently this as well as the preceding petition is offered up for the whole intelligent creation who are all interested in this grand event the final renovation of all things by gods putting an end to misery and sin to infirmity and death taking all things into his own hands and setting up the kingdom which endureth throughout all ages exactly answerable to this are those awful words in the prayer at the burial of the dead beseeching thee that it may please thee of thy gracious goodness shortly to accomplish the number of thine elect and to hasten thy kingdom that we with all those that are departed in the true faith of thy holy name may have our perfect consummation and bliss both in body and soul in thy everlasting glory 9 thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven  this is the necessary and immediate consequence wherever the kingdom of god is come wherever god dwells in the soul by faith and christ reigns in the heart by love it is probable many perhaps the generality of men at the first view of these words are apt to imagine they are only an expression of or petition for resignation for a readiness to suffer the will of god whatsoever it be concerning us and this is unquestionably a divine and excellent temper a most precious gift of god but this is not what we pray for in this petition at least not in the chief and primary sense of it we pray not so much for a passive as for an active conformity to the will of god in saying thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven how is it done by the angels of god in heaven  those who now circle his throne rejoicing they do it willingly they love his commandments and gladly hearken to his words it is their meat and drink   to do his will it is their highest glory and joy they do it continually there is no interruption in their willing service they rest not day nor night but employ every hour speaking after the manner of men otherwise our measures of duration days and nights and hours have no place in eternity in fulfilling his commands in executing his designs in performing the counsel of his will and they do it perfectly no sin no defect belongs to angelic minds it is true the stars are not pure in his sight even the morningstars that sing together before him in his sight that is in comparison of him the very angels are not pure but this does not imply that they are not pure in themselves doubtless they are they are without spot and blameless they are altogether devoted to his will and perfectly obedient in all things  if we view this in another light we may observe the angels of god in heaven do all the will of god and they do nothing else nothing but what they are absolutely assured is his will again they do all the will of god as he willeth in the manner which pleases him and no other yea and they do this only because it is his will for this end and no other reason 10 when therefore we pray that the will of god may be done in earth as it is in heaven the meaning is that all the inhabitants of the earth even the whole race of mankind may do the will of their father which is in heaven as willingly as the holy angels that these may do it continually even as they without any interruption of their willing service yea and that they may do it perfectly  that the god of peace through the blood of the everlasting covenant may make them perfect in every good work to do his will and work in them all which is wellpleasing in his sight in other words we pray that we and all mankind may do the whole will of god in all things and nothing else not the least thing but what is the holy and acceptable will of god we pray that we may do the whole will of god as hewilleth in the manner that pleases him and lastly that we may do it because it is his will that this may be the sole reason and ground the whole and only motive of whatsoever we think or whatsoever we speak or do 11 give us this day our daily bread  in the three former petitions we have been praying for all mankind we come now more particularly to desire a supply for our own wants not that we are directed even here to confine our prayer altogether to ourselves but this and each of the following petitions may be used for the whole church of christ upon earth by bread we may understand all things needful whether for our souls or bodies ta proszoen kai eusebeian  the things pertaining to life and godliness we understand not barely the outward bread what our lord terms the meat whichperisheth but much more the spiritual bread the grace of god the food whichendureth unto everlasting life it was the judgment of many of the ancient fathers that we are here to understand the sacramental bread also daily received in the beginning by the whole church of christ and highly esteemed till the love of many waxed cold as the grand channel whereby the grace of his spirit was conveyed to the souls of all the children of god our daily bread  the word we render daily has been differently explained by different commentators but the most plain and natural sense of it seems to be this which is retained in almost all translations as well ancient as modern  what is sufficient for this day and so for each day as it succeeds 12 give us  for we claim nothing of right but only of free mercy we deserve not the air we breathe the earth that bears or the sun that shines upon us all our desert we own is hell but god loves us freely therefore we ask him to give what we can no more procure for ourselves than we can merit it at his hands not that either the goodness or the power of god is a reason for us to stand idle it is his will that we should use all diligence in all things that we should employ our utmost endeavours as much as if our success were the natural effect of our own wisdom and strength and then as though we had done nothing we are to depend on him the giver of every good and perfect gift this day  for we are to take no thought for the morrow for this very end has our wise creator divided life into these little portions of time so clearly separated from each other that we might look   on every day as a fresh gift of god another life which we may devote to his glory and that every evening may be as the close of life beyond which we are to see nothing but eternity 13 and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them that trespass against us  as nothing but sin can hinder the bounty of god from flowing forth upon every creature so this petition naturally follows the former that all hinderances being removed we may the more clearly trust in the god of love for every manner of thing which is good our trespasses  the word properly signifies our debts thus our sins are frequently represented in scripture every sin laying us under a fresh debt to god to whom we already owe as it were ten thousand talents what then can we answer when he shall say pay me that thouowest we are utterly insolvent we have nothing to pay we have wasted all our substance therefore if he deal with us according to the rigour of his law if he exact what he justly may he must command us to be bound hand and foot and delivered over to the tormentors indeed we are already bound hand and foot by the chains of our own sins these considered with regard to ourselves are chains of iron and fetters of brass they are wounds wherewith the world the flesh and the devil have gashed and mangled us all over they are diseases that drink up our blood and spirits that i bring us down to the chambers of the grave but considered as they are here with regard to god they are debts immense and numberless well therefore seeing we have nothing to pay may we cry unto him that he would frankly forgive us all the word translated forgive implies either to forgive a debt or to unloose a chain and if we attain the former the latter follows of course if our debts are forgiven the chains fall off our hands as soon as ever through the free grace of god in christ we receive forgiveness of sins we receive likewise a lot among those which are sanctified by faith which is in him sin has lost its power it has no dominion over those who are under grace that is in favour with god as there is now no condemnation for them that are in christ jesus so they are freed from sin as well as from guilt the righteousness of the law is fulfilled in them and they walk not after the flesh but after the spirit  14 as we forgive them that trespass against us  in these words our lord clearly declares both on what condition and in what degree or manner we may look to be forgiven of god all our trespasses and sins are forgiven us if we forgive and as we forgive others first god forgives us if we forgive others this is a point of the utmost importance and our blessed lord is so jealous lest at any time we should let it slip out of our thoughts that he not only inserts it in the body of his prayer but presently after repeats it twice over if saith he ye forgive men their trespasses your heavenly father will also forgive you but if ye forgive not men their trespasses neither will your father forgive your trespasses matt 614 15 secondly god forgives us as we forgive others so that if any malice or bitterness if any taint of unkindness or anger remains if we do not clearly fully and from the heart forgive all men their trespasses we far cut short the forgiveness of our own god cannot clearly and fully forgive us he may show us some degree of mercy but we will not suffer him to blot out all our sins and forgive all our iniquities in the mean time while we do not from our hearts forgive our neighbour his trespasses what manner of prayer are we offering to god whenever we utter these words we are indeed setting god at open defiance we are daring him to do his worst forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them that trespass against us that is in plain terms do not thou forgive us at all we desire no favour at thy hands we pray that thou wilt keep our sins in remembrance and that thy wrath may abide upon us but can you seriously offer such a prayer to god and hath he not yet cast you quick into hell o tempt him no longer now even now by his grace forgive as you would be forgiven now have compassion on thy fellowservant as god hath had and will have pity on thee 15 and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil and lead us not into temptation the word translated temptation means trial of any kind and so the english word temptation was formerly taken in an indifferent sense although now it is usually understood of solicitation to sin st james uses the word in both these senses first in its general then in its restrained acceptation he takes it in the former sense when he saith blessed is the man thatendureth temptation for when he   is tried or approved of god he shall receive the crown of life james 112 13 he immediately adds taking the word in the latter sense let no man say when he is tempted i am tempted of god for god cannot be tempted with evil neithertempteth he any man but every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust or desireexelkomenos drawn out of god in whom alone he is safe  and enticed caught as a fish with a bait then it is when he is thus drawn away and enticed that he properly enters into temptation then temptation covers him as a cloud it overspreads his whole soul then how hardly shall he escape out of the snare therefore we beseech god not to lead us into temptation that is seeing godtempteth no man not to suffer us to be led into it but deliver us from evil rather from the evil oneapo tou ponerou ho poneros is unquestionably the wicked one emphatically so called the prince and god of this world who works with mighty power in the children of disobedience but all those who are the children of god by faith are delivered out of his hands he may fight against them and so he will but he cannot conquer unless they betray their own souls he may torment for a time but he cannot destroy for god is on their side who will not fail in the end to avenge his own elect that cry unto him day and night lord when we are tempted suffer us not to enter into temptation do thou make a way for us to escape that the wicked one touch us not 16 the conclusion of this divine prayer commonly called the doxology is a solemn

men to fast verily i say unto you they have their reward but thou when thou fastest anoint thine head and wash thy face that thou appear not unto men to fast but unto thy father which is in secret and thy father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly matthew 61618 1 it has been the endeavour of satan from the beginning of the world to put asunder what god hath joined together to separate inward from outward religion to set one of these at variance with the other and herein he has met with no small success among those who were ignorant of his devices many in all ages having a zeal for god but not according to knowledge have been strictly attached to the righteousness of the law the performance of outward duties but in the mean time wholly regardless of inward righteousness the righteousness which is of god by faith and many have run into the opposite extreme disregarding all outward duties perhaps even speaking evil of the law and judging the law so far as it enjoins the performance of them it is by this very device of satan that faith and works have been so often set at variance with each other and many who had a real zeal for god have for a time fallen into the snare on either hand some have magnified faith to the utter exclusion of good works not only from being the cause of our justification for we know that man is justified freely by the redemption which is in jesus but from being the necessary fruit of it yea from having any place in the religion of jesus christ others eager to avoid this dangerous mistake have run as much too far the contrary way and either maintained that good works were the cause at least the previous condition of justification  or spoken of them as if they were all in all the whole religion of jesus christ in the same manner have the end and the means of religion been set at variance with each other some wellmeaning men have seemed to place all religion in attending the prayers of the church in receiving the lords supper in hearing sermons and reading books of piety neglecting mean time the end of all these the love of god and their neighbour and this very thing has confirmed others in the neglect if not contempt of the ordinances of god  so wretchedly abused to undermine and overthrow the very end they were designed to establish but of all the means of grace there is scarce any concerning which men have run into greater extremes than that of which our lord speaks in the abovementioned words i mean religious fasting how have some exalted this beyond all scripture and reason  and others utterly disregarded it as it were revenging themselves by undervaluing as much as the former had overvalued it those have spoken of it as if it were all in all if not the end itself yet infallibly connected with it these as if it were just nothing as if it were a fruitless labour which had no relation at all thereto whereas it is certain the truth lies between them both it is not all nor yet is it nothing it is not the end but it is a precious means thereto a means which god himself has ordained and in which therefore when it is duly used he will surely give us his blessing in order to set this in the clearest light i shall endeavour to show first what is the nature of fasting and what the several sorts and degrees thereof secondly what are the reasons grounds and ends of it thirdly how we may answer the most plausible objections against it and fourthly in what manner it should be performed i 1 i shall endeavour to show first what is the nature of fasting and what the several sorts and degrees thereof as to the nature of it all the inspired writers both in the old testament and the new take the word to fast in one single sense for not to eat to abstain from food this is so clear that it would be labour lost to quote the words of davidnehemiah isaiah and the prophets which   followed or of our lord and his apostles all agreeing in this that to fast is not to eat for a time prescribed to this other circumstances were usually joined by them of old which had no necessaryconnexion with it such were the neglect of their apparel the laying aside those ornaments which they were accustomed to wear the putting on mourning the strewing ashes upon their head or wearing sackcloth next their skin but we find little mention made in the new testament of any of these indifferent circumstances nor does it appear that any stress was laid upon them by the christians of the purer ages however some penitents might voluntarily use them as outward signs of inward humiliation much less did the apostles or the christians contemporary with them beat or tear their own flesh such discipline as this was not unbecoming the priests or worshippers of baal the gods of the heathens were but devils and it was doubtless acceptable to their devilgod when his priests 1 kings 1828 cried aloud and cut themselves after their manner till the blood gushed out upon them but it cannot be pleasing to him nor become his followers who came not to destroy mens lives but to save them  as to the degrees or measures of fasting we have instances of some who have fasted several days together so moses elijah and our blessed lord being endued with supernatural strength for that purpose are recorded to have fasted without intermission forty days and forty nights but the time of fasting more frequently mentioned in scripture is one day from morning till evening and this was the fast commonly observed among the ancient christians but beside these they had also their halffasts semijejunia as tertullian styles them on the fourth and sixth days of the week wednesday and friday throughout the year on which they took no sustenance till three in the afternoon the time when they returned from the public service nearly related to this is what our church seems peculiarly to mean by the term abstinence which may be used when we cannot fast entirely by reason of sickness or bodily weakness this is the eating little the abstaining in part the taking a smaller quantity of food than usual i do not remember any scriptural instance of this but neither can i condemn it for the scripture does not it may have its use and receive a blessing from god the lowest kind of fasting if it can be called by that name is the abstaining from pleasant food of this we have several instances in scripture besides that of daniel and his brethren who from a peculiar consideration namely that they might not defile themselves with the portion of the kings meat nor with the wine which he drank a daily provision of which the king had appointed for them requested and obtained of the prince of the eunuchs pulse to eat and water to drink daniel 18 c perhaps from a mistaken imitation of this might spring the very ancient custom of abstaining from flesh and wine during such times as were set apart for fasting and abstinence  if it did not rather arise from a supposition that these were the most pleasant food and a belief that it was proper to use what was least pleasing at those times of solemn approach to god in the jewish church there were some stated fasts such was the fast of the seventh month appointed by god himself to be observed by all israel under the severest penalty the lord spake unto moses saying on the tenth day of this seventh month there shall be a day of atonement and ye shall afflict your souls  to make an atonement for you before the lord your god for whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that same day he shall be cut off from among his peoplelev 2326 c in afterages several other stated fasts were added to these so mention is made by the prophet zechariah of the fast not only of the seventh but also of the fourth of the fifth and of the tenth month zech 819 in the ancient christian church there were likewise stated fasts and those both annual and weekly of the former sort was that before easter observed by some for eightandforty hours by others for an entire week by many for two weeks taking no sustenance till the evening of each day of the latter those of the fourth and sixth days of the week observed asepiphanius writes remarking it as an undeniable fact en holei tei oikoumenei  in the whole habitable earth at least in every place where any christians made their abode the annual fasts in our church are the forty days of lent the ember days at the four seasons the rogation days and the vigils or eves of several solemn festivals  the weekly all fridays in the year except christmasday   but beside those which were fixed in every nation fearing god there have always been occasional fasts appointed from time to time as the particular circumstances and occasions of each required so when the children of moab and the children of ammon came against jehoshaphat to battle jehoshaphat set himself to seek the lord and proclaimed a fast throughout alljudah 2 chron 201 3 and so in the fifth year of jehoiakim the son of josiah in the ninth month when they were afraid of the king of babylon the princes of judah proclaimed a fast before the lord to all the people of jerusalem jer 369 and in like manner particular persons who take heed unto their ways and desire to walk humbly and closely with god will find frequent occasion for private seasons of thus afflicting their souls before their father which is in secret and it is to this kind of fasting that the directions here given do chiefly and primarily refer ii 1 i proceed to show in the second place what are the grounds the reasons and ends of fasting and first men who are under strong emotions of mind who are affected with any vehement passion such as sorrow or fear are often swallowed up therein and even forget to eat their bread at such seasons they have little regard for food not even what is needful to sustain nature much less for any delicacy or variety being taken up with quite different thoughts thus whensaul said i am sore distressed for the philistines make war against me and god is departed from me it is recorded he had eaten no bread all the day nor all the night 1 sam 2815 20 thus those who were in the ship with st paul when no small tempest lay upon them and all hope that they should be saved was taken away continued fasting having taken nothing no regular meal for fourteen days together acts 2733 and thus david and all the men that were with him when they heard that the people were fled from the battle and that many of the people were fallen and dead andsaul and jonathan his son were dead also mourned and wept and fasted until even forsaul and jonathan and for the house of israel 2 sam 112 nay many times they whose minds are deeply engaged are impatient of any interruption and even loathe their needful food as diverting their thoughts from what they desire should engross their whole attention even as saul when on the occasion mentioned before he had fallen all along upon the earth and there was no strength in him yet said i will not eat till his servants together with the woman compelled him 2 here then is the natural ground of fasting one who is under deep affliction overwhelmed with sorrow for sin and a strong apprehension of the wrath of god would without any rule without knowing or considering whether it were a command of god or not forget to eat his bread abstain not only from pleasant but even from needful food  like st paul who after he was led into damascus was three days without sight and did neither eat nor drink acts 99 yea when the storm rose high when an horrible dread overwhelmed one who had been without god in the world his soul would loathe all manner of meat it would be unpleasing and irksome to him he would be impatient of anything that should interrupt his ceaseless cry lord save or i perish  how strongly is this expressed by our church in the first part of the homily on fasting  when men feel in themselves the heavy burden of sin see damnation to be the reward of it and behold with the eye of their mind the horror of hell they tremble they quake and are inwardly touched with sorrowfulness of heart and cannot but accuse themselves and open their grief unto almighty god and call unto him for mercy this being done seriously their mind is so occupied taken up partly with sorrow and heaviness partly with an earnest desire to be delivered from this danger of hell and damnation that all desire of meat and drink is laid apart and loathsomeness or loathing of all worldly things and pleasure cometh in place so that nothing then liketh them more than to weep to lament to mourn and both with words and behaviour of body to show themselves weary of life 3 another reason or ground of fasting is this many of those who now fear god are deeply sensible how often they have sinned against him by the abuse of these lawful things they know how much   they have sinned by excess of food how long they have transgressed the holy law of god with regard to temperance if not sobriety too how they have indulged their sensual appetites perhaps to the impairing even their bodily health  certainly to the no small hurt of their soul for hereby they continually fed and increased that sprightly folly that airiness of mind that levity of temper that gay inattention to things of the deepest concern that giddiness and carelessness of spirit which were no other than drunkenness of soul which stupefied all their noblest faculties no less than excess of wine or strong drink to remove therefore the effect they remove the cause they keep at a distance from all excess they abstain as far as is possible from what had well nigh plunged them in everlasting perdition they often wholly refrain always take care to be sparing and temperate in all things they likewise well remember howfulness of bread increased not only carelessness and levity of spirit but also foolish and unholy desires yea unclean and vile affections and this experience puts beyond all doubt even a genteel regular sensuality is continuallysensualizing the soul and sinking it into a level with the beasts that perish it cannot be expressed what an effect variety and delicacy of food have on the mind as well as the body making it just ripe for every pleasure of sense as soon as opportunity shall invite therefore on this ground also every wise man will refrain his soul and keep it low will wean it more and more from all those indulgences of the inferior appetites which naturally tend to chain it down to earth and to pollute as well as debase it here is another perpetual reason for fasting to remove the food of lust and sensuality to withdraw the incentives of foolish and hurtful desires of vile and vain affections perhaps we need not altogether omit although i know not if we should do well to lay any great stress upon it another reason for fasting which some good men have largely insisted on namely the punishing themselves for having abused the good gifts of god by sometimes wholly refraining from them thus exercising a kind of holy revenge upon themselves for their past folly and ingratitude in turning the things which should have been for their health into an occasion of falling they suppose david to have had an eye to this when he said i wept and chastened or punished my soul with fasting and st paul when he mentions what revenge godly sorrow occasioned in the corinthians a fifth and more weighty reason for fasting is that it is an help to prayer particularly when we set apart larger portions of time for private prayer then especially it is that god is often pleased to lift up the souls of his servants above all the things of earth and sometimes to rap them up as it were into the third heavens and it is chiefly as it is an help to prayer that it has so frequently been found a means in the hand of god of confirming and increasing not one virtue not chastity only as some have idly imagined without any ground either from scripture reason or experience but also seriousness of spirit earnestness sensibility and tenderness of conscience deadness to the world and consequently the love of god and every holy and heavenly affection not that there is any natural or necessary connexion between fasting and the blessings god conveys thereby but he will have mercy as he will have mercy he will convey whatsoeverseemeth him good by whatsoever means he is pleased to appoint and he hath in all ages appointed this to be a means of averting his wrath and obtaining whatever blessings we from time to time stand in need of  how powerful a means this is to avert the wrath of god we may learn from the remarkable instance of ahab there was none like him who did sell himself  wholly give himself up like a slave bought with money  to work wickedness yet when he rent his clothes and put sackcloth upon his flesh and fasted and went softly the word of the lord came toelijah saying seest thou how ahab humbleth himself before me because hehumbleth himself before me i will not bring the evil in his days it was for this end to avert the wrath of god that daniel sought god with fasting and sackcloth and ashes this appears from the whole tenor of his prayer particularly from the solemn conclusion of it o lord according to all thy righteousness or mercies let thy anger be turned away from thy holy mountain  hear the prayer of thy servant and cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary that is desolate  o lord hear o lord forgive o lord hearken and do for thine own sake dan 93 16 c   but it is not only from the people of god that we learn when his anger is moved to seek him by fasting and prayer but even from the heathens whenjonah had declared yet forty days and nineveh shall be overthrown the people ofnineveh proclaimed a fast and put on sackcloth from the greatest of them unto the least for the king ofnineveh arose from his throne and laid his robe from him and covered him with sackcloth and sat in ashes and he caused it to be proclaimed and published through nineveh let neither man nor beast herd nor flock taste anything let them not feed nor drink water not that the beast had sinned or could repent but that by their example man might be admonished considering that for his sin the anger of god was hanging over all creatures who can tell if god will turn and repent and turn away from his fierce anger that we perish not and their labour was not in vain the fierce anger of god was turned away from them god saw their works the fruits of that repentance and faith which he had wrought in them by his prophet and god repented of the evil that he had said he would do unto them and he did it notjonah 34 c and it is a means not only of turning away the wrath of god but also of obtaining whatever blessings we stand in need of so when the other tribes were smitten before thebenjamites all the children of israel went up unto the house of god and wept and fasted that day until even and then the lord said go up again for tomorrow i will deliver them into thine hand judges 2026 c so samuel gathered all israel together when they were in bondage to the philistines and they fasted on that day before the lord and when the philistines drew near to battle against israel the lord thundered upon them with a great thunder and discomfited them and they were smitten before israel 1 sam 76 so ezra i proclaimed a fast at the river ahava that we might afflict ourselves before our god to seek of him a right way for us and for our little ones and he was entreated of us ezra 821 so nehemiah i fasted and prayed before the god of heaven and said prosper i pray thee thy servant this day and grant him mercy in the sight of this man and god granted him mercy in the sight of the king neh 1411  in like manner the apostles always joined fasting with prayer when they desired the blessing of god on any important undertaking thus we read acts 13 there were in the church that was at antioch certain prophets and teachers as they ministered to the lord and fasted doubtless for direction in this very affair the holy ghost said separate mebarnabas and saul for the work whereunto i have called them and when they had a second time fasted and prayed and laid their hands on them they sent them away acts 1313 thus also paul and barnabas themselves as we read in the following chapter when they returned again to lystra iconium and antioch confirming the souls of the disciples and when they had ordained them elders in every church and had prayed with fasting commended them to the lord acts 1423 yea that blessings are to be obtained in the use of this means which are no otherwise attainable our lord expressly declares in his answer to his disciples asking why could not we cast him out jesus said unto them because of your unbelief for verily i say unto you if ye have faith as a grain of mustardseed ye shall say unto this mountain remove hence to yonder place and it shall remove and nothing shall be impossible unto you howbeit this kind of devilsgoeth not out but by prayer and fasting matt 1719 c  these being the appointed means of attaining that faith whereby the very devils are subject unto you 11 these were the appointed means for it was not merely by the light of reason or of natural conscience as it is called that the people of god have been in all ages directed to use fasting as a means to these ends but they have been from time to time taught it of god himself by clear and open revelations of his will such is that remarkable one by the prophetjoel therefore saith the lord turn you to me with all your heart and with fasting and with weeping and with mourning  who knoweth if he will return and repent and leave a blessing behind him blow the trumpet in zion sanctify a fast call a solemn assembly  then will the lord be jealous over his land and will pity his people yea i will send you corn and wine and oil  i will no more make you a reproach among the heathen joel 212 c nor are they only temporal blessings which god directs his people to expect in the use of these means for at the same time that he promised to those who should seek him with fasting and weeping and   mourning i will restore you the years which locust hath eaten the cankerworm and the caterpillar and the palmerworm my great army he subjoins so shall ye eat and be satisfied and praise the name of the lord your god  ye shall also know that i am in the midst of israel and that i am the lord your god and then immediately follows the great gospel promise i will pour out my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams and your young men shall see visions and also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will i pour out my spirit joel 22829 12 now whatsoever reasons there were to quicken those of old in the zealous and constant discharge of this duty they are of equal force still to quicken us but above all these we have a peculiar reason for being in fastings often namely the command of him by whose name we are called he does not indeed in this place expressly enjoin either fasting giving of alms or prayer but his directions how to fast to give alms and to pray are of the same force with such injunctions for the commanding us to do anything thus is an unquestionable command to do that thing seeing it is impossible to perform it thus if it be not performed at all consequently the saying give alms pray fast in such a manner is a clear command to perform all those duties as well as to perform them in that manner which shall in nowise lose its reward and this is a still farther motive and encouragement to the performance of this duty even the promise which our lord has graciously annexed to the due discharge of it thy father whichseeth in secret shall reward thee openly such are the plain grounds reasons and ends of fasting such our encouragement to persevere therein notwithstanding abundance of objections which men wiser than their lord have been continually raising against it iii 1 the most plausible of these i come now to consider and first it has been frequently said let a christian fast from sin and not from food this is what god requires at his hands so he does but he requires the other also therefore this ought to be done and that not left undone view your argument in its full dimensions and you will easily judge of the strength of it  if a christian ought to abstain from sin then he ought not to abstain from food but a christian ought to abstain from sin therefore he ought not to abstain from food that a christian ought to abstain from sin is most true but how does it follow from hence that he ought not to abstain from food yea let him do both the one and the other let him by the grace of god always abstain from sin and let him often abstain from food for such reasons and ends as experience and scripture plainly show to be answered thereby but is it not better as it has secondly been objected to abstain from pride and vanity from foolish and hurtful desires from peevishness and anger and discontent than from food without question it is but here again we have need to remind you of our lords words these things ought ye to have done and not to leave the other undone and indeed the latter is only in order to the former it is a means to that great end we abstain from food with this view  that by the grace of god conveyed into our souls through this outward means in conjunction with all the other channels of his grace which he hath appointed we may be enabled to abstain from every passion and temper which is not pleasing in his sight we refrain from the one that being endued with power from on high we may be able to refrain from the other so that your argument proves just the contrary to what you designed it proves that we ought to fast for if we ought to abstain from evil tempers and desires then we ought thus to abstain from food since these little instances of selfdenial are the ways god hath chose wherein to bestow that great salvation but we do not find it so in fact this is a third objection we have fasted much and often but what did it avail we were not a whit better we found no blessing therein nay we have found it an hinderance rather than an help instead of preventing anger for instance or fretfulness it has been a means of increasing them to such a height that we could neither bear others nor ourselves this may   very possibly be the case it is possible either to fast or pray in such a manner as to make you much worse than before more unhappy and more unholy yet the fault does not lie in the means itself but in the manner of using it use it still but use it in a different manner do what god commands as he commands it and then doubtless his promise shall not fail his blessings shall be withheld no longer but when thou fastest in secret he thatseeth in secret shall reward thee openly but is it not mere superstition so it has been fourthly objected to imagine that god regards such little things as these if you say it is you condemn all the generations of gods children but will you say these were all weak superstitious men can you be so hardy as to affirm this both of moses and joshua ofsamuel and david of jehosaphat ezra nehemiah and all the prophets yea of a greater than all  the son of god himself it is certain both our master and all these his servants did imagine that fasting is not a little thing and that he who is higher than the highest doth regard it of the same judgment it is plain were all his apostles after they were filled with the holy ghost and with wisdom when they had the unction of the holy one teaching them all things they still approved themselves the ministers of god byfastings as well as by the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left after the bridegroom was taken from them then did they fast in those days nor would they attempt anything as we have seen above wherein the glory of god was nearly concerned such as the sending forth labourers into the harvest without solemn fasting as well as prayer  but if fasting be indeed of so great importance and attended with such a blessing is it not best say some fifthly to fast always not to do it now and then but to keep a continual fast to use as much abstinence at all times as our bodily strength will bear let none be discouraged from doing this by all means use as little and plain food exercise as much selfdenial herein at all times as your bodily strength will bear and this may conduce by the blessing of god to several of the great ends abovementioned it may be a considerable help not only to chastity but also to heavenlymindedness to the weaning your affections from things below and setting them on things above but this is not fasting scriptural fasting it is never termed so in all the bible it in some measure answers some of the ends thereof but still it is another thing practise it by all means but not so as thereby to set aside a command of god and an instituted means of averting his judgments and obtaining the blessings of his children  use continually then as much abstinence as you please which taken thus is no other than christian temperance but this need not at all interfere with your observing solemn times of fasting and prayer for instance your habitual abstinence or temperance would not prevent your fasting in secret if you were suddenly overwhelmed with huge sorrow and remorse and with horrible fear and dismay such a situation of mind would almost constrain you to fast you would loathe your daily food you would scarce endure even to take such supplies as were needful for the body till god lifted you up out of the horrible pit and set your feet upon a rock and ordered your goings the same would be the case if you were in agony of desire vehemently wrestling with god for his blessing you would need none to instruct you not to eat bread till you had obtained the request of your lips 7 again had you been at nineveh when it was proclaimed throughout the city let neither man nor beast herd nor flock taste anything let them not feed or drink water but let them cry mightily unto god  would your continual fast have been any reason for not bearing part in that general humiliation doubtless it would not you would have been as much concerned as any other not to taste food on that day no more would abstinence or the observing a continual fast have excused any of the children of israel from fasting on the tenth day of the seventh month that shall not be afflicted shall not fast in that day he shall be cut off from among his people lastly had you been with the brethren inantioch at the time when they fasted and prayed before the sending forth of barnabas and saul can you possibly imagine that your temperance or abstinence would have been a sufficient cause for not joining therein without doubt if you had not you would soon have been cut off from the christian community you would have deservedly been cast out from among them as bringing confusion into the church of god   iv 1 i am in the last place to show in what manner we are to fast that it may be an acceptable service unto the lord and first let it be done unto the lord with our eye singly fixed on him let our intention herein be this and this alone to glorify our father which is in heaven to express our sorrow and shame for our manifold transgressions of his holy law to wait for an increase of purifying grace drawing our affections to things above to add seriousness and earnestness to our prayers to avert the wrath of god and to obtain all the great and precious promises which he hath made to us in jesus christ  let us beware of mocking god of turning our fast as well as our prayers into an abomination unto the lord by the mixture of any temporal view particularly by seeking the praise of men against this our blessed lord more peculiarly guards us in the words of the text moreover when ye fast be ye not as the hypocrites  such were too many who were called the people of god of a sad countenance sour affectedly sad putting their looks into a peculiar form for they disfigure their faces not only by unnatural distortions but also by covering them with dust and ashes that they may appear unto men to fast this is their chief if not only design verily i say unto you they have their reward even the admiration and praise of men but thou when thou fastest anoint thy head and wash thy face do as thou art accustomed to do at other times that thou appear not unto men to fast  let this be no part of thy intention if they know it without any desire of thine it matters not thou art neither the better nor the worse  but unto thy father which is in secret and thy father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly but if we desire this reward let us beware secondly of fancying we merit anything of god by our fasting we cannot be too often warned of this inasmuch as a desire to establish our own righteousness to procure salvation of debt and not of grace is so deeply rooted in all our hearts fasting is only a way which god hath ordained wherein we wait for his unmerited mercy and wherein without any desert of ours he hath promised freely to give us his blessing not that we are to imagine the performing the bare outward act will receive any blessing from god is it such a fast that i have chosen saith the lord a day for a man to afflict his soul is it to bow down his head as a bulrush and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him are these outward acts however strictly performed all that is meant by a mans afflicting his soul  wilt thou call this a fast and an acceptable day to the lord no surely if it be a mere external service it is all but lost labour such a performance may possibly afflict the body but as to the soul profiteth nothing yea the body may sometimes be afflicted too much so as to be unfit for the works of our calling this also we are diligently to guard against for we ought to preserve our health as a good gift of god therefore care is to be taken whenever we fast to proportion the fast to our strength for we may not offer god murder for sacrifice or destroy our bodies to help our souls but at these solemn seasons we may even in great weakness of body avoid that other extreme for which god condemns those who of old expostulated with him for not accepting their fasts wherefore have we fasted say they and thouseest not  behold in the day of your fast you find pleasure saith the lord if we cannot wholly abstain from food we may at least abstain from pleasant food and then we shall not seek his face in vain 5 but let us take care to afflict our souls as well as our bodies let every season either of public or private fasting be a season of exercising all those holy affections which are implied in a broken and contrite heart let it be a season of devout mourning of godly sorrow for sin such a sorrow as that of the corinthians concerning which the apostle saith i rejoice not that ye were made sorry but that ye sorrowed to repentance for ye were made sorry after a godly manner that ye might receive damage by us in nothing for godly sorrow  he kata theon lype  the sorrow which is according to god which is a precious gift of his spirit lifting the soul to god from whom it flows  worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of yea and let our sorrowing after a godly sort work in us the same inward and outward repentance the same entire change of heart renewed after the image of god in righteousness and true holiness and the same change of life till we are holy as he is holy in all manner of conversation let it work in us the same carefulness to be found in him without spot and blameless the same clearing of ourselves by our lives rather than words by our abstaining from all appearance of evil the same indignation vehement abhorrence of every sin the   same fear of our own deceitful hearts the same desire to be in all things conformed to the holy and acceptable will of god the same zeal for whatever may be a means of his glory and of our growth in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ and the same revenge against satan and all his works against all filthiness both of flesh and spirit 2 cor 79 c and with fasting let us always join fervent prayer pouring out our whole souls before god confessing our sins with all their aggravations humbling ourselves under his mighty hand laying open before him all our wants all our guiltiness and helplessness this is a season for enlarging our prayers both in behalf of ourselves and of our brethren let us now bewail the sins of our people and cry aloud for the city of our god that the lord may build up zion and cause his face to shine on her desolations thus we may observe the men of god in ancient times always joined prayer and fasting together thus the apostles in all the instances cited above and thus our lord joins them in the discourse before us  it remains only in order to our observing such a fast as is acceptable to the lord that we add alms thereto works of mercy after our power both to the bodies and souls of men with such sacrifices also god is well pleased thus the angel declares tocornelius fasting and praying in his house thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before god acts 104 c and this god himself expressly and largely declares is not this the fast that i have chosen to loose the bands of wickedness to undo the heavy burdens to let the oppressed go free and that ye break every yoke is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house when thou seest the naked that thou cover him and that thou hide not thyself from thy own flesh then shall thy light break forth as the morning and thine health shall spring forth speedily and thy righteousness shall go before thee the glory of the lord shall be thy reward then shalt thou call and the lord shall answer thou shalt cry and he shall say here i am  if when thou fastest thou draw out thy soul to the hungry and satisfy the afflicted soul then shall thy light rise in obscurity and thy darkness be as the noonday and the lord shall guide thee continually and satisfy thy soul in drought and make fat thy bones and thou shalt be like a watered garden and like a spring of water whose waters fail not isa 586 c   sermon 28 text of the 1872 ed upon our lords sermon on the mount discourse 8 lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth where moth and rust doth corrupt and where thieves break through and steal but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt and where thieves do not break through nor steal for where your treasure is there will your heart be also the light of the body is the eye if therefore thine eye be single thy whole body shall be full of light but if thine eye be evil thy whole body shall be full of darkness if therefore the light that is in thee be darkness how great is that darkness matt 61923 1 from those which are commonly termed religious actions and which are real branches of true religion where they spring from a pure and holy intention and are performed in a manner suitable thereto  our lord proceeds to the actions of common life and shows that the same purity of intention is as indispensably required in our ordinary business as in giving alms or fasting or prayer and without question the same purity of intention which makes our alms and devotions acceptable must also make our labour or employment a proper offering to god if a man pursues his business that he may raise himself to a state of honour and riches in the world he is no longer serving god in his employment and has no more title to a reward from god than he who gives alms that he may be seen or prays that he may be heard of men for vain and earthly designs are no more allowable in our employments than in our alms and devotions they are not only evil when they mix with our good works with our religious actions but they have the same evil nature when they enter into the common business of ouremployments if it were allowable to pursue them in our worldly employments it would be allowable to pursue them in our devotions but as our alms and devotions are not an acceptable service but when they proceed frond a pure intention so our common employment cannot be reckoned a service to him but when it is performed with the same piety of heart  this our blessed lord declares in the liveliest manner in those strong and comprehensive words which he explains enforces and enlarges upon throughout this whole chapter the light of the body is the eye if therefore thine eye be single thy whole body shall be full of light but if thine eye be evil thy whole body shall be full of darkness the eye is the intention what the eye is to the body the intention is to the soul as the one guides all the motions of the body so does the other those of the soul this eye of the soul is then said to be single when it looks at one thing only when we have no other design but to know god and jesus christ whom he hath sent  to know him with suitable affections loving him as he hath loved us to please god in all things to serve god as we love him with all our heart and mind and soul and strength and to enjoy god in all and above all things in time and in eternity  if thine eye be thus single thus fixed on god thy whole body shall be full of light thy whole body  all that is guided by the intention as the body is by the eye all thou art all thou doest thy desires tempers affections thy thoughts and words and actions the whole of these shall be full of light full of true divine knowledge this is the first thing we may here understand by light in his light thou shalt see light he which of old commanded light to shine out of darkness shall shine in thy heart he shall enlighten the eyes of thy understanding with the knowledge of the glory of god his spirit shall reveal unto thee the deep things of god the inspiration of the holy one shall give thee understanding and cause thee to know wisdom secretly yea the anointing which thou receivest of him shall abide in thee and teach thee of all things   how does experience confirm this even after god hath opened the eyes of our understanding if we seek or desire anything else than god how soon is our foolish heart darkened then clouds again rest upon our souls doubts and fears again overwhelm us we are tossed to and fro and know not what to   do or which is the path wherein we should go but when we desire and seek nothing but god clouds and doubts vanish away we who were sometime darkness are now light in the lord the night now shineth as the day and we find the path of the upright is light godshoweth us the path wherein we should go and maketh plain the way before our face 4 the second thing which we may here understand by light is holiness while thouseekest god in all things thou shalt find him in all the fountain of all holiness continually filling thee with his own likeness with justice mercy and truth while thoulookest unto jesus and him alone thou shalt be filled with the mind that was in him thy soul shall be renewed day by day after the image of him that created it if the eye of thy mind be not removed from him if thouendurest as seeing him that is invisible and seeking nothing else in heaven or earth then as thoubeholdest the glory of the lord thou shalt be transformed into the same image from glory to glory by the spirit of the lord and it is also matter of daily experience that by grace we are thus saved through faith it is by faith that the eye of the mind is opened to see the light of the glorious love of god and as long as it is steadily fixed thereon on god in christ reconciling the world unto himself we are more and more filled with the love of god and man with meekness gentleness longsuffering with all the fruits of holiness which are through christ jesus to the glory of god the father this light which fills him who has a single eye implies thirdly happiness as well as holiness surely light is sweet and a pleasant thing it is to see the sun but how much more to see the sun of righteousness continually shining upon the soul and if there be any consolation in christ if any comfort of love if any peace thatpasseth all understanding if any rejoicing in hope of the glory of god they all belong to him whose eye is single thus is his whole body full of light hewalketh in the light as god is in the light rejoicing evermore praying without ceasing and in everything giving thanks enjoying whatever is the will of god concerning him in christ jesus but if thine eye be evil thy whole body shall be full of darkness if thine eye be evil  we see there is no medium between a single and an evil eye if the eye be not single then it is evil if the intention in whatever we do be not singly to god if we seek anything else then our mind and conscience are defiled our eye therefore is evil if in anything we do we aim at any other end than god if we have any view but to know and to love god to please and serve him in all things if we have any other design than to enjoy god to be happy in him both now and for ever 7 if thine eye be not singly fixed on god thy whole body shall be full of darkness the veil shall still remain on thy heart thy mind shall be more and more blinded by the god of this world lest the light of the glorious gospel of christ should shine upon thee thou wilt be full of ignorance and error touching the things of god not being able to receive or discern them and even when thou hast some desire to serve god thou wilt be full of uncertainty as to the manner of serving him finding doubts and difficulties on every side and not seeing any way to escape yea if thine eye be not single if thou seek any of the things of earth thou shalt be full of ungodliness and unrighteousness thy desires tempers affections being all out of course being all dark and vile and vain and thy conversation will be evil as well as thy heart not seasoned with salt or meet to minister grace unto the hearers but idle unprofitable corrupt grievous to the holy spirit of god 8 both destruction and unhappiness are in thy ways for the way of peace hast thou not known there is no peace no settled solid peace for them that know not god there is no true nor lasting content for any who do not seek him with their whole heart while thouaimest at any of the things that perish all that cometh is vanity yea not only vanity but vexation of spirit and that both in the pursuit and the enjoyment also thouwalkest indeed in a vain shadow anddisquietest thyself in vain thou walkest in darkness that may be felt sleep on but thou canst not take thy rest the dreams of life can give pain and that thou knowest but ease they cannot give there is no rest in this world or the world to come but only in god the centre of spirits   if the light which is in thee be darkness how great is that darkness if the intention which ought to enlighten the whole soul to fill it with knowledge and love and peace and which in fact does so as long as it is single as long as it aims at god alone  if this be darkness if it aim at anything beside god and consequently cover the soul with darkness instead of light with ignorance and error with sin and misery o how great is that darkness it is the very smoke which ascends out of the bottomless pit it is the essential night which reigns in the lowest deep in the land of the shadow of death 9 therefore lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth where moth and rust doth corrupt and where thieves break through and steal if you do it is plain your eye is evil it is not singly fixed on god with regard to most of the commandments of god whether relating to the heart or life the heathens of africa or america stand much on a level with those that are called christians the christians observe them a few only being excepted very near as much as the heathens for instance the generality of the natives of england commonly called christians are as sober and as temperate as the generality of the heathens near the cape of good hope and so the dutch or french christians are as humble and as chaste as the choctaw or cherokee indians it is not easy to say when we compare the bulk of the nations in europe with those in america whether the superiority lies on the one side or the other at least the american has not much the advantage but we cannot affirm this with regard to the command now before us here the heathen has far the preeminence he desires and seeks nothing more than plain food to eat and plain raiment to put on and he seeks this only from day to day he reserves he lays up nothing unless it be as much corn at one season of the year as he will need before that season returns this command therefore the heathens though they know it not do constantly and punctually observe they lay up for themselves no treasures upon earth no stores of purple or fine linen of gold or silver which either moth or rust may corrupt or thieves break through and steal but how do the christians observe what they profess to receive as a command of the most high god not at all not in any degree no more than if no such command had ever been given to man even the good christians as they are accounted by others as well as themselves pay no manner of regard thereto it might as well be still hid in its original greek for any notice they take of it in what christian city do you find one man of five hundred who makes the least scruple of laying up just as much treasure as he can  of increasing his goods just as far as he is able there are indeed those who would not do this unjustly there are many who will neither rob nor steal and some who will not defraud their neighbour nay who will not gain either by his ignorance or necessity but this is quite another point even these do not scruple the thing but the manner of it they do not scruple the laying up treasures upon earth but the laying them up by dishonesty they do not start at disobeying christ but at a breach of heathen morality so that even these honest men do no more obey this command than a highwayman or a housebreaker nay they never designed to obey it from their youth up it never entered into their thoughts they were bred up by their christian parents masters and friends without any instruction at all concerning it unless it were this  to break it as soon and as much as they could and to continue breaking it to their lives end there is no one instance of spiritual infatuation in the world which is more amazing than this most of these very men read or hear the bible read  many of them every lords day they have read or heard these words an hundred times and yet never suspect that they are themselves condemned thereby any more than by those which forbid parents to offer up their sons or daughters unto moloch o that god would speak to these miserable selfdeceivers with his own voice his mighty voice that they may at last awake out of the snare of the devil and the scales may fall from their eyes do you ask what it is to lay up treasures on earth it will be needful to examine this thoroughly and let us first observe what is not forbidden in this command that we may then clearly discern what is we are not forbidden in this command first to provide things honest in the sight of all men to provide wherewith we may render unto all their due  whatsoever they can justly demand of us so far from it that we are taught of god to owe no man anything we ought therefore to use all diligence in our calling in order to owe no man anything this being no other than a plain law of common justice which our lord came not to destroy but to fulfil   neither secondly does he here forbid the providing for ourselves such things as are needful for the body a sufficiency of plain wholesome food to eat and clean raiment to put on yea it is our duty so far as god puts it into our power to provide these things also to the end we may eat our own bread and be burdensome to no man nor yet are we forbidden thirdly to provide for our children and for those of our own household this also it is our duty to do even upon principles of heathen morality every man ought to provide the plain necessaries of life both for his own wife and children and to put them into a capacity of providing these for themselves when he is gone hence and is no more seen i say of providing these the plain necessaries of life not delicacies not superfluities  and that by their diligent labour for it is no mans duty to furnish them any more than himself with the means either of luxury or idleness but if any man provides not thus far for his own children as well as for the widows of his own house of whom primarily st paul is speaking in those wellknown words to timothy he hath practically denied the faith and is worse than an infidel or heathen lastly we are not forbidden in these words to lay up from time to time what is needful for the carrying on our worldly business in such a measure and degree as is sufficient to answer the foregoing purposes  in such a measure as first to owe no man anything secondly to procure for ourselves the necessaries of life and thirdly to furnish those of our own house with them while we live and with the means of procuring them when we are gone to god we may now clearly discern unless we are unwilling to discern it what that is which is forbidden here it is the designedly procuring more of this worlds goods than will answer the foregoing purposes the labouring after a larger measure of worldly substance a larger increase of gold and silver  the laying up any more than these ends require  is what is here expressly and absolutely forbidden if the words have any meaning at all it must be this for they are capable of no other consequently whoever he is that owing no man anything and having food and raiment for himself and his household together with a sufficiency to carry on his worldly business so far as answers these reasonable purposes whosoever i say being already in these circumstances seeks a still larger portion on earth he lives in an open habitual denial of the lord that bought him he hath practically denied the faith and is worse than an african or american infidel hear ye this all ye that dwell in the world and love the world wherein ye dwell ye may be highly esteemed of men but ye are an abomination in the sight of god how long shall your souls cleave to the dust how long will ye load yourselves with thick clay when will ye awake and see that the open speculative heathens are nearer the kingdom of heaven than you when will ye be persuaded to choose the better part that which cannot be taken away from you when will ye seek only to lay up treasures in heaven renouncing dreading abhorring all other if you aim at laying up treasures on earth you are not barely losing your time and spending your strength for that which is not bread for what is the fruit if you succeed  you have murdered your own soul you have extinguished the last spark of spiritual life therein now indeed in the midst of life you are in death you are a living man but a dead christian for where your treasure is there will your heart be also your heart is sunk into the dust your soulcleaveth to the ground your affections are set not on things above but on things of the earth on poor husks that may poison but cannot satisfy an everlasting spirit made for god your love your joy your desire are all placed on the things which perish in the using you have thrown away the treasure in heaven god and christ are lost you have gained riches and hellfire o how hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of god when our lords disciples were astonished at his speaking thus he was so far from retracting it that he repeated the same important truth in stronger terms than before it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god how hard is it for them whose very word is applauded not to be wise in their own eyes how hard for them not to think themselves better than the poor base uneducated herd of men how hard not to seek happiness in their riches or in things dependent upon them in gratifying the desire of the flesh the desire of the eye or the pride of life o ye rich how can ye escape the damnation of hell only with all god all things are possible   15 and even if you do not succeed what is the fruit of your endeavouring to lay up treasures on earth they that will be rich hoi boulomenoi ploutein they that desire that endeavour after it whether they succeed or no fall into a temptation and a snare  a gin a trap of the devil and into many foolish and hurtful lusts epithymias anoetous desires with which reason hath nothing to do such as properly belong not to rational and immortal beings but only to the brute beasts which have no understanding  which drown men in destruction andperdi tion in present and eternal misery let us but open our eyes and we may daily see the melancholy proofs of this  men who desiring resolving to be rich coveting after money the root of all evil have already pierced themselves through with many sorrows and anticipated the hell to which they are going the cautiousness with which the apostle here speaks is highly observable he does not affirm this absolutely of the rich for a man may possibly be rich without any fault of his by an overruling providence preventing his own choice but he affirms it of hoiboulomenoi plourein those who desire or seek to be rich riches dangerous as they are do not always drown men in destruction and perdition but the desire of riches does those who calmly desire and deliberately seek to attain them whether they do in fact gain the world or no do infallibly lose their own souls these are they that sell him who bought them with his blood for a few pieces of gold or silver these enter into a covenant with death and hell and their covenant shall stand for they are daily making themselves meet to partake of their inheritance with the devil and his angels o who shall warn this generation of vipers to flee from the wrath to come not those who lie at their gate or cringe at their feet desiring to be fed with the crumbs that fall from their tables not those who court their favour or fear their frown none of those who mind earthly things but if there be a christian upon earth if there be a man who hath overcome the world who desires nothing but god and fears none but him that is able to destroy both body and soul in hell thou o man of god speak and spare not lift up thy voice like a trumpet cry aloud and show these honourable sinners the desperate condition wherein they stand it may be one in a thousand may have ears to hear may arise and shake himself from the dust may break loose from these chains that bind him to the earth and at length lay up treasures in heaven and if it should be that one of these by the mighty power of god awoke and asked what must i do to be saved the answer according to the oracles of god is clear full and express god doth not say to thee sell all that thou hast indeed he whoseeth the hearts of men saw it needful to enjoin this in one peculiar case that of the young rich ruler but he never laid it down for a general rule to all rich men in all succeeding generations his general direction is first be not high minded god seeth not as man seeth he esteems thee not for thy riches grandeur or equipage for any qualification or accomplishment which is directly or indirectly owing to thy wealth which can be bought or procured thereby all these are with him as dung and dross let them be so with thee also beware thou think not thyself to be one jot wiser or better for all these things weigh thyself in another balance estimate thyself only by the measure of faith and love which god hath given thee if thou hast more of the knowledge and love of god than he thou art on this account and no other wiser and better more valuable and honourable than him who is with the dogs of thy flock but if thou hast not this treasure those art more foolish more vile more truly contemptible i will not say than the lowest servant under thy roof but than the beggar laid at thy gate full of sores secondly trust not in uncertain riches trust not in them for help and trust not in them for happiness first trust not in them for help thou art miserably mistaken if thoulookest for this in gold or silver these are no more able to set thee above the world than to set thee above the devil know that both the world and the prince of this world laugh at all such preparations against them these will little avail in the day of troubleeven if they remain in the trying hour but it is not certain that they will for how oft do they make themselves wings and fly away but if not what support will they afford even in the ordinary troubles of life the desire of thy eyes the wife of thy youth thy son thine only son or the friend which was as thy own soul is taken away at a stroke will thy riches reanimate the breathless clay or call back its late inhabitant will they secure thee from sickness diseases pain do these visit the poor only nay he that feeds thy flocks or tills thy ground has less sickness and pain than thou he is more rarely visited by these unwelcome guests and if they come there at all they are   more easily driven away from the little cot than from the cloudtopt palaces and during the time that thy body is chastened with pain or consumes away with pining sickness how do thy treasures help thee let the poor heathen answer  ut lippum pictae tabulae fomenta podagrum auriculas citharae collecta sorde dolentes such help as pictures to sore eyes afford as heapdup tables to their gouty lord 19 but there is at hand a greater trouble than all these thou art to die thou art to sink into dust to return to the ground from which thou wast taken to mix with common clay thy body is to go to the earth as it was while thy spirit returns to god that gave it and the time draws on the years slide away with a swift though silent pace perhaps your day is far spent the noon of life is past and the evening shadows begin to rest upon you you feel in yourself sure approaching decay the springs of life wear away apace now what help is there in your riches do they sweeten death do they endear that solemn hour quite the reverse o death how bitter art thou to a man thatliveth at rest in his possessions how unacceptable to him is that awful sentence this night shall thy soul be required of thee  or will they prevent the unwelcome stroke or protract the dreadful hour can they deliver your soul that it should not see death can they restore the years that are past can they add to your appointed time a month a day an hour a moment  or will the good things you have chosen for your portion here follow you over the great gulf not so naked came you into this world naked must you return  linquenda tellus et domus et placens uxor neque harum quas colis arborum te praeter invisam cupressos ulla brevem dominum sequetur the following is boscawens translation of these verses fromhorace thy lands thy dome thy pleasing wife these must thou quit tis natures doom no tree whose culture charms thy life save the sad cypress waits thy tomb  edit surely were not these truths too plain to be observed because they are too plain to be denied no man that is to die could possibly trust for help in uncertain riches 20 and trust not in them for happiness for here also they will be found deceitful upon the weights indeed this every reasonable man may infer from what has been observed already for if neither thousands of gold and silver nor any of the advantages or pleasures purchased thereby can prevent our being miserable it evidently follows they cannot make us happy what happiness can they afford to him who in the midst of all is constrained to cry out to my new courts sad thought does still repair and round my gilded roofs hangs hovering care   indeed experience is here so full strong and undeniable that it makes all other arguments needless appeal we therefore to fact are the rich and great the only happy men and is each of them more or less happy in proportion to his measure of riches are they happy at all i had well nigh said they are of all men most miserable rich man for once speak the truth from thy heart speak both for thyself and for thy brethren amidst our plenty something still to me to thee to him is wanting that cruel something unpossessed corrodes and leavens all the rest yea and so it will till thy wearisome days of vanity are shut up in the night of death surely then to trust in riches for happiness is the greatest folly of all that are under the sun are you not convinced of this is it possible you should still expect to find happiness in money or all it can procure what can silver and gold and eating and drinking and horses and servants and glittering apparel and diversions and pleasures as they are called make thee happy they can as soon make thee immortal 21 these are all dead show regard them not trust thou in the living god so shalt thou be safe under the shadow of the almighty his faithfulness and truth shall be thy shield and buckler he is a very present help in time of trouble such an help as can never fail then shalt thou say if all thy other friends die the lord liveth and blessed be my strong helper he shall remember thee when thou liest sick upon thy bed when vain is the help of man when all the things of earth can give no support he will make all thy bed in thy sickness he will sweeten thy pain the consolations of god shall cause thee to clap thy hands in the flames and even when this house of earth is well nigh shaken down when it is just ready to drop into the dust he will teach thee to say o death where is thy sting o grave where is thy victory thanks be unto god whogiveth me the victory through my lord jesus christ  o trust in him for happiness as well as for help all the springs of happiness are in him trust in him who giveth us all things richly to enjoy parechonti plousios panta eis apolausin  who of his own rich and free mercy holds them out to us as in his own hand that receiving them as his gift and as pledges of his love we may enjoy all that we possess it is his love gives a relish to all we taste  puts life and sweetness into all while every creature leads us up to the great creator and all earth is a scale to heaven he transfuses the joys that are at his own right hand into all he bestows on his thankful children who having fellowship with the father and his son jesus christ enjoy him in all and above all thirdly seek not to increase in goods lay not up for thyself treasures upon earth this is a flat positive command full as clear as thou shalt not commit adultery how then is it possible for a rich man to grow richer without denying the lord that bought him yea how can any man who has already the necessaries of life gain or aim at more and be guiltless lay not up saith our lord treasures upon earth if in spite of this you do and will lay up money or goods which moth or rust may corrupt or thieves break through and steal if you will add house to house or field to field  why do you call yourself a christian you do not obey jesus christ you do not design it why do you name yourself by his name why call ye me lord lord saith he himself and do not the things which i say  if you ask but what must we do with our goods seeing we have more than we have occasion to use if we must not lay them up must we throw them away i answer if you threw them into the sea if you were to cast them into the fire and consume them they would be better bestowed than they are now you cannot find so mischievous a manner of throwing them away as either the laying them up for your posterity or the laying them out upon yourselves in folly and superfluity of all possible   methods of throwing them away these two are the very worst the most opposite to the gospel of christ and the most pernicious to your own soul how pernicious to your own soul the latter of these is has been excellently shown by a late writer  if we waste our money we are not only guilty of wasting a talent which god has given us but we do ourselves this farther harm we turn this useful talent into a powerful means of corrupting ourselves because so far as it is spent wrong so far it is spent in the support of some wrong temper in gratifying some vain and unreasonable desires which as christians we are obliged to renounce as wit and fine parts cannot be only trifled away but will expose those that have them to greater follies so money cannot be only trifled away but if it is not used according to reason and religion will make people live a more silly and extravagant life than they would have done without it if therefore you dont spend your money in doing good to others you must spend it to the hurt of yourself you act like one that refuses the cordial to his sick friend which he cannot drink himself without inflaming his blood for this is the case of superfluous money if you give it to those who want it is a cordial if you spend it upon yourself in something that you do not want it only inflames and disorders your mind  in using riches where they have no real use nor we any real want we only use them to our great hurt in creating unreasonable desires in nourishing ill tempers in indulging in foolish passions and supporting a vain turn of mind for high eating and drinking fine clothes and fine houses state and equipage gay pleasures and diversions do all of them naturally hurt and disorder our heart they are the food and nourishment of all the folly and weakness of our nature they are all of them the support of something that ought not to be supported they are contrary to that sobriety and piety of heart which relishes divine things they are so many weights upon our mind that makes us less able and less inclined to raise our thoughts and affections to things above so that money thus spent is not merely wasted or lost but it is spent to bad purposes and miserable effects to the corruption and disorder of our hearts to the making us unable to follow the sublime doctrines of the gospel it is but like keeping money from the poor to buy poison for ourselves 24 equally inexcusable are those who lay up what they do not need for any reasonable purposes  if a man had hands and eyes and feet that he could give to those that wanted them if he should lock them up in a chest instead of giving them to his brethren that were blind and lame should we not justly reckon him an inhuman wretch if he should rather choose to amuse himself with hoarding them up than entitle himself to an eternal reward by giving them to those that wanted eyes and hands might we not justly reckon him mad now money has very much the nature of eyes and feet if therefore we lock it up in chests while the poor and distressed want it for their necessary uses we are not far from the cruelty of him that chooses rather to hoard up the hands and eyes than to give them to those that want them if we choose to lay it up rather than to entitle ourselves to an eternal reward by disposing of our money well we are guilty of his madness that rather chooses to lock up eyes and hands than to make himself for ever blessed by giving them to those that want them may not this be another reason why rich men shall so hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven a vast majority of them are under a curse under the peculiar curse of god inasmuch as in the general tenor of their lives they are not only robbing god continually embezzling and wasting their lords goods and by that very means corrupting their own souls but also robbing the poor the hungry the naked wronging the widow and the fatherless and making themselves accountable for all the want affliction and distress which they may but do not remove yea doth not the blood of all those who perish for want of what they either lay up or lay out needlessly cry against them from the earth o what account will they give to him who is ready to judge both the quick and the dead the true way of employing what you do not want yourselves you may fourthly learn from those words of our lord which are the counterpart of what went before lay up for yourselves treasures in   heaven where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt and where thieves do not break through and steal put out whatever thou canst spare upon better security than this world can afford lay up thy treasures in the bank of heaven and god shall restore them in that day he that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the lord and look what helayeth out it shall be paid him again place that saith he unto my account howbeit thouowest me thine own self besides give to the poor with a single eye with an upright heart and write so much given to god for inasmuch as ye did it unto one of the least of these my brethren ye have done it unto me this is the part of a faithful and wise steward not to sell either his houses or lands or principal stock be it more or less unless some peculiar circumstance should require it and not to desire or endeavour to increase it any more than to squander it away in vanity but to employ it wholly to those wise and reasonable purposes for which his lord has lodged it in his hands the wise steward after having provided his own household with what is needful for life and godliness makes himself friends with all that remains from time to time of the mammon of unrighteousness that when he fails they may receive him into everlasting habitations  that whensoever his earthly tabernacle is dissolved they who were before carried intoabrahams bosom after having eaten his bread and worn the fleece of his flock and praised god for the consolation may welcome him into paradise and to the house of god eternal in the heavens we charge you therefore who are rich in this world as having authority from our great lord and master agathoergein  to be habitually doing good to live in a course of good works be ye merciful as your father which is in heaven is merciful who doth good andceaseth not be ye merciful  how far after your power with all the ability which godgiveth make this your only measure of doing good not any beggarly maxims or customs of the world we charge you to be rich in good works as you have much to give plenteously freely ye have received freely give so as to lay up no treasure but in heaven be ye ready to distribute to everyone according to his necessity disperse abroad give to the poor deal your bread to the hungry cover the naked with a garment entertain the stranger carry or send relief to them that are in prison heal the sick not by miracle but through the blessing of god upon your seasonable support let the blessing of him that was ready to perish through pining want come upon thee defend the oppressed plead the cause of the fatherless and make the widows heart sing for joy  we exhort you in the name of the lord jesus christ to be willing to communicate koinonikous einai to be of the same spirit though not in the same outward state with those believers of ancient times who remained steadfast entei koinoniai in that blessed and holy fellowship wherein none said that anything was his own but they had all things common be a steward a faithful and wise steward of god and of the poor differing from them in these two circumstances only that your wants are first supplied out of the portion of your lords goods which remains in your hands and that you have the blessedness of giving thus lay up for yourselves a good foundation not in the world which now is but rather for the time to come that ye may lay hold on eternal life the great foundation indeed of all the blessings of god whether temporal or eternal is the lord jesus christ  his righteousness and blood  what he hath done and what he hath suffered for us and other foundation in this sense can no man lay no not an apostle no not an angel from heaven but through his merits whatever we do in his name is a foundation for a good reward in the day when every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour therefore labour thou not for the meat thatperisheth but for that which endureth unto everlasting life therefore whatsoever thy hand now findeth to do do it with thy might therefore let no fair occasion pass unheeded by snatching the golden moments as they fly thou by few fleeting years ensure eternity by patient continuance in welldoing seek thou for glory and honour and immortality in a constant zealous performance of all good works wait thou for that happy hour when the king shall say i was an hungered and ye gave me meat i was thirsty and ye gave me drink i was a stranger   and ye took me in naked and ye clothed me i was sick and ye visited me i was in prison and ye came unto me  come ye blessed of my father receive the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world   sermon 29 text of the 1872 edition upon our lords sermon on the mount discourse 9 no man can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or else he will hold to the one and despise the other ye cannot serve god and mammon therefore i say unto you take no thought for your life what ye shall eat or what ye shall drink nor yet for your body what ye shall put on is not the life more than meat and the body than raiment behold the fowls of the air for they sow not neither do they reap nor gather into barns yet your heavenly father feedeth them are ye not much better than they which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature and why take ye thought for raiment consider the lilies of the field how they grow they toil not neither do they spin and yet i say unto you that even solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these wherefore if god so clothe the grass of the field which today is and tomorrow is cast into the oven shall he not much more clothe you o ye of little faith therefore take no thought saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink or wherewithal shall we be clothed for after all these things do the gentiles seek for your heavenly fatherknoweth that ye have need of all these things but seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you take therefore no thought for the morrow for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof matt 62434 1 it is recorded of the nations whom the king ofassyria after he had carried israel away into captivity placed in the cities ofsamaria that they feared the lord and served their own gods these nations saith the inspired writer feared the lord performed an outward service to him a plain proof that they had a fear of god though not according to knowledge and served their graven images both their children and their childrens children as did their fathers so do they unto this day 2 kings 1733 c  how nearly does the practice of most modern christians resemble this of the ancient heathens they fear the lord they also perform an outward service to him and hereby show they have some fear of god but they likewise serve their own gods there are those who teach them as there were who taught the assyrians the manner of the god of the land the god whose name the country bears to this day and who was once worshipped there with an holy worship howbeit they do not serve him alone they do not fear him enough for this but every nationmaketh gods of their own every nation in the cities wherein they dwell these nations fear the lord they have not laid aside the outward form of worshipping him but they serve their graven images silver and gold the work of mens hands money pleasure and praise the gods of this world more than divide their service with the god of israel this is the manner both of their children and their childrens children as did their fathers so do they unto this day 2 but although speaking in a loose way after the common manner of men those poor heathens were said to fear the lord yet we may observe the holy ghost immediately adds speaking according to the truth and real nature of things they fear not the lord neither do after the law and the commandment which the lord commanded the children of jacob with whom the lord made a covenant and charged them saying ye shall not fear other gods nor serve them  but the lord your god ye shall fear and he shall deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies the same judgment is passed by the unerring spirit of god and indeed by all the eyes of whose understanding he hath opened to discern the things of god upon these poor christians commonly so called if we speak according to the truth and real nature of things they fear not the lord neither do they serve him for they do not after the covenant the lord hath made with them neither after the   law and commandment which he hath commanded them saying thou shalt worship the lord thy god and him only shalt thou serve they serve other gods unto this day and no man can serve two masters how vain is it for any man to aim at this  to attempt the serving of two masters is it not easy to foresee what must be the unavoidable consequence of such an attempt either he will hate the one and love the other or else he will hold to the one and despise the other the two parts of this sentence although separately proposed are to be understood in connection with each other for the latter part is a consequence of the former he will naturally hold to him whom he loves he will so cleave to him as to perform to him a willing faithful and diligent service and in the meantime he will so far at least despise the master he hates as to have little regard to his commands and to obey them if at all in a slight and careless manner therefore whatsoever the wise men of the world may suppose ye cannot serve god and mammon mammon was the name of one of the heathen gods who was supposed to preside over riches it is here understood of riches themselves gold and silver or in general money and by a common figure of speech of all that may be purchased thereby such as easehonor and sensual pleasure but what are we here to understand by serving god and what by serving mammon we cannot serve god unless we believe in him this is the only true foundation of serving him therefore believing in god as reconciling the world to himself through christ jesus the believing in him as a loving pardoning god is the first great branch of his service and thus to believe in god implies to trust in him as our strength without whom we can do nothing who every moment endues us with power from on high without which it is impossible to please him as our help our only help in time of trouble whocompasseth us about with songs of deliverance as our shield our defender and the lifter up of our head above all our enemies that are round about us it implies to trust in god as our happiness as the centre of spirits the only rest of our souls the only good who is adequate to all our capacities and sufficient to satisfy all the desires he hath given us it implies what is nearly allied to the other to trust in god as our end to have an eye to him in all things to use all things only as means of enjoying him wheresoever we are or whatsoever we do to see him that is invisible looking on us wellpleased and to refer all things to him in christ jesus 5 thus to believe is the first thing we are to understand by serving god the second is to love him now to love god in the manner the scripture describes in the manner god himself requires of us and by requiring engages to work in us  is to love him as the one god that is with all our heart and with all our soul and with all our mind and with all our strength  it is to desire god alone for his own sake and nothing else but with reference to him  to rejoice in god  to delight in the lord not only to seek but find happiness in him to enjoy god as thechiefest among ten thousand to rest in him as our god and our all  in a word to have such a possession of god as makes us always happy  6 a third thing we are to understand by serving god is to resemble or imitate him so the ancient father optimus dei cultus imitari quem colis it is the best worship or service of god to imitate him you worship we here speak of imitating or resembling him in the spirit of our minds for here the true christian imitation of god begins god is a spirit and they that imitate or resemble him must do it in spirit and in truth now god is love therefore they who resemble him in the spirit of their minds are transformed into the same image they are merciful even as he is merciful their soul is all love they are kind   benevolent compassionate tenderhearted and that not only to the good and gentle but also to the froward yea they are like him loving unto every man and their mercy extends to all his works one thing more we are to understand by serving god and that is the obeying him the glorifying him with our bodies as well as with our spirits the keeping his outward commandments the zealously doing whatever he hath enjoined the carefully avoiding whatever he hath forbidden the performing all the ordinary actions of life with a single eye and a pure heart offering them all in holy fervent love as sacrifices to god through jesus christ let us consider now what we are to understand on the other hand by serving mammon and first it implies the trusting in riches in money or the things purchasable thereby as our strength  the means whereby we shall perform whatever cause we have in hand the trusting in them as our help  by which we look to be comforted in or delivered out of trouble it implies the trusting in the world for happiness the supposing that a mans life the comfort of his life consisteth in the abundance of the things which hepossesseth the looking for rest in the things that are seen for content in outward plenty the expecting that satisfaction in the things of the world which can never be found out of god and if we do this we cannot but make the world our end the ultimate end if not of all at least of many of our undertakings many of our actions and designs in which we shall aim only at an increase of wealth at the obtaining pleasure or praise at the gaining a larger measure of temporal things without any reference to things eternal the serving mammon implies secondly loving the world desiring it for its own sake the placing our joy in the things thereof and setting our hearts upon them the seeking what indeed it is impossible we should find our happiness therein the resting with the whole weight of our souls upon the staff of this broken reed although daily experience shows it cannot support but will only enter into our hand and pierce it to resemble to be conformed to the world is a third thing we are to understand by serving mammon to have not only designs but desires tempers affections suitable to those of the world to be of an earthly sensual mind chained down to the things of earth to be selfwilled inordinate lovers of ourselves to think highly of our ownattainments to desire and delight in the praise of men to fear shun and abhor reproach to be impatient of reproof easy to be provoked and swift to return evil for evil to serve mammon is lastly to obey the world by outwardly conforming to its maxims and customs to walk as other men walk in the common road in the broad smooth beaten path to be in the fashion to follow a multitude to do like the rest of our neighbours that is to do the will of the flesh and the mind to gratify our appetites and inclinations to sacrifice to ourselves aim at our own ease and pleasure in the general course both of our words and actions now what can be more undeniably clear than that we cannot thus serve god and mammon does not every man see that he cannot comfortably serve both that to trim between god and the world is the sure way to be disappointed in both and to have no rest either in one or the other how uncomfortable a condition must he be in who having the fear but not the love of god  who serving him but not with all his heart  has only the toils and not the joys of religion he has religion enough to make him miserable but not enough to make him happy his religion will not let him enjoy the world and the world will not let him enjoy god so that by halting between both he loses both and has no peace either in god or the world does not every man see that he cannot serve both consistently with himself what more glaring inconsistency can be conceived than must continually appear in his wholebehavior who is endeavoring to obey both these masters  striving to serve god and mammon he is indeed a sinner that goeth two ways one step forward and another backward he is continually building up with one hand and pulling down with the other he loves sin and he hates it he is always seeking   and yet always fleeing from god he would and he would not he is not the same man for one day no not for an hour together he is a motley mixture of all sorts of contrarieties a heap of contradictions jumbled in one o be consistent with thyself one way or the other turn to the right hand or to the left if mammon be god serve thou him if the lord then serve him but never think of serving either at all unless it be with thy whole heart does not every reasonable every thinking man see that he cannot possibly serve god and mammon because there is the most absolute contrariety the most irreconcilable enmity between them the contrariety between the most opposite things on earth between fire and water darkness and light vanishes into nothing when compared to the contrariety between god and mammon so that in whatsoever respect you serve the one you necessarily renounce the other do you believe in god through christ do you trust in him as your strength your help your shield and your exceeding great reward as your happiness your end in all above all things then you cannot trust in riches it is absolutely impossible you should so long as you have this faith in god do you thus trust in riches then you have denied the faith you do not trust in the living god do you love god do you seek and find happiness in him then you cannot love the world neither the things of the world you are crucified to the world and the world crucified to you do you love the world are your affections set on things beneath do you seek happiness in earthly things then it is impossible you should love god then the love of the father is not in you do you resemble god are you merciful as your father is merciful are you transformed by the renewal of your mind into the image of him that created you then you cannot be conformed to the present world you have renounced all its affections and lusts are you conformed to the world does your soul still bear the image of the earthly then you are not renewed in the spirit of your mind you do not bear the image of the heavenly do you obey god are you zealous to do his will on earth as the angels do in heaven then it is impossible you should obey mammon then you set the world at open defiance you trample its customs and maxims under foot and will neither follow nor be led by them do you follow the world do you live like other men do you please men do you please yourself then you cannot be a servant of god you are of your master and father the devil  therefore thou shalt worship the lord thy god and him only shalt thou serve thou shalt lay aside all thoughts of obeying two masters of serving god and mammon thou shalt propose to thyself no end no help no happiness but god thou shalt seek nothing in earth or heaven but him thou shalt aim at nothing but to know to love and enjoy him and because this is all your business below the only view you can reasonably have the one design you are to pursue in all things  therefore i say unto you as our lord continues his discourse take no thought for your life what ye shall eat or what ye shall drink nor yet for your body what ye shall put on  a deep and weighty direction which it imports us well to consider and thoroughly to understand our lord does not here require that we should be utterly without thought even touching the concerns of this life a giddy careless temper is at the farthest remove from the whole religion of jesus christ neither does he require us to be slothful in business to be slack and dilatory therein this likewise is contrary to the whole spirit and genius of his religion a christian abhors sloth as much as drunkenness and flees from idleness as he does from adultery he well knows that there is one kind of thought and care with which god is well pleased which is absolutely needful for the due performance of those outward works unto which the providence of god has called him it is the will of god that every man should labour to eat his own bread yea and that every man should provide for his own for them of his own household it is likewise his will that we should owe no man anything but provide things honest in the sight of all men but this cannot be done without taking some thought without having some care upon our minds yea often not without long and serious thought not without much and earnest care consequently this care to provide for ourselves and our household this thought how to render to all their dues our blessed lord does not condemn yea it is good and acceptable in the sight of god our saviour it is good and acceptable to god that we should so take thought concerning whatever we have in hand as to have a clear comprehension of what we are about to do and to plan our business before we enter upon it and it is right that we should carefully consider from time to time what steps we are to take therein as well as that we should prepare all things beforehand for the carrying it on in the most   effectual manner this care termed by some the care of the head it was by no means our lords design to condemn what he here condemns is the care of the heart the anxious uneasy care the care that hath torment all such care as does hurt either to the soul or body what he forbids is that care which sad experience shows wastes the blood and drinks up the spirits which anticipates all the misery it fears and comes to torment us before the time he forbids only that care which poisons the blessings of today by fear of what may be tomorrow which cannot enjoy the present plenty through apprehensions of future want this care is not only a sore disease a grievous sickness of soul but also an heinous offence against god a sin of the deepest dye it is a high affront to the gracious governor and wise disposer of all things necessarily implying that the great judge does not do right that he does not order all things well it plainly implies that he is wanting either in wisdom if he does not know what things we stand in need of or in goodness if he does not provide those things for all who put their trust in him beware therefore that you take not thought in this sense be ye anxiously careful for nothing take no uneasy thought this is a plain sure rule uneasy care is unlawful care with a single eye to god do all that in you lies to provide things honest in the sight of all men and then give up all into better hands leave the whole event to god take no thought of this kind no uneasy thought even for your life what ye shall eat or what ye shall drink nor yet for your body what ye shall put on is not the life more than meat and the body than raiment if then god gave you life the greater gift will he not give you food to sustain it if he hath given you the body how can ye doubt but he will give you raiment to cover it more especially if you give yourselves up to him and serve him with your whole heart behold see before your eyes the fowls of the air for they sow not neither do they reap nor gather into barns and yet they lack nothing yet your heavenly fatherfeedeth them are ye not much better than they ye that are creatures capable of god are ye not of more account in the eyes of god of a higher rank in the scale of beings and which of you by taking thought can add one cubit to his stature what profit have you then from this anxious thought it is every way fruitless and unavailing and why take ye thought for raiment have ye not a daily reproof wherever you turn your eyes consider the lilies of the field how they grow they toil not neither do they spin and yet i say unto you that even solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these wherefore if god so clothe the grass of the field which today is and tomorrow is cast into the oven is cut down burned up and seen no more shall he not much more clothe you o ye of little faith you whom he made to endure for ever and ever to be pictures of his own eternity ye are indeed of little faith otherwise ye could not doubt of his love and care no not for a moment therefore take no thought saying what shall we eat if we lay up no treasure upon earth what shall we drink if we serve god with all our strength if our eye be singly fixed on him wherewithal shall we be clothed if we are not conformed to the world if we disoblige those by whom we might be profited for after all these things do the gentiles seek  the heathens who know not god but ye are sensible your heavenly fatherknoweth that ye have need of all these things and he hath pointed out to you an infallible way of being constantly supplied therewith seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you seek ye first the kingdom of god  before ye give place to any other thought or care let it be your concern that the god and father of our lord jesus christ who gave his only begotten son to the end that believing in him ye might not perish but have everlasting life may reign in your heart may manifest himself in your soul and dwell and rule there that he may cast down every high thing which exalteth itself against the knowledge of god and bring into captivity every thought to the obedience of christ let god have the sole dominion over you let him reign without a rival let him possess all your heart and rule alone let him be your one desire your joy your love so that all that is within you may continually cry out the lord god omnipotentreigneth   seek the kingdom of god and his righteousness righteousness is the fruit of gods reigning in the heart and what is righteousness but love  the love of god and of all mankind flowing from faith in jesus christ and producing humbleness of mind meekness gentlenesslongsuffering patience   deadness to the world and every right disposition of heart toward god and toward man and by these it produces all holy actions whatsoever are lovely or of good report whatsoever works of faith and labour of love are acceptable to god and profitable to man his righteousness  this is all his righteousness still it is his own free gift to us for the sake of jesus christ the righteous through whom alone it is purchased for us and it is his work it is he alone that worketh it in us by the inspiration of the holy spirit perhaps the well observing this may give light to some otherscriptures which we have not always so clearly understood st paul speaking in his epistle to the romans concerning the unbelieving jews saith they being ignorant of gods righteousness and going about to establish their own righteousness have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of god i believe this may be one sense of the words they were ignorant of gods righteousness not only of the righteousness of christ imputed to every believer whereby all his sins are blotted out and he is reconciled to the favour of god but which seems here to be more immediately understood they were ignorant of that inward righteousness of that holiness of heart which is with the utmost propriety termed gods righteousness as being both his own free gift through christ and his own work by his almighty spirit and because they were ignorant of this they went about to establish their own righteousness they laboured to establish that outside righteousness which might very properly be termed their own for neither was it wrought by the spirit of god nor was it owned or accepted of him they might work this themselves by their own natural strength and when they had done it was a stink in his nostrils and yet trusting in this they would not submit themselves unto the righteousness of god yea they hardened themselves against that faith whereby alone it was possible to attain it for christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone that believeth christ when he said it is finished put an end to that law  to the law of external rites and ceremonies that he might bring in a better righteousness through his blood by that one oblation of himself once offered even the image of god into the inmost soul of everyone that believeth  nearly related to these are those words of the apostle in his epistle to thephilippians i count all things but dung that i may win christ an entrance into his everlasting kingdom and be found in him believing in him not having mine own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the faith of christ the righteousness which is of god by faith  not having my own righteousness which is of the law a barely external righteousness the outside religion i formerly had when i hoped to be accepted of god because i was touching the righteousness which is of the law blameless  but that which is through the faith of christ the righteousness which is of god by faith phil 389 that holiness of heart that renewal of the soul in all its desires tempers and affections which is of god it is the work of god and not of man by faith through the faith of christ through the revelation of jesus christ in us and by faith in his blood whereby alone we obtain the remission of our sins and an inheritance among those that are sanctified seek ye first this kingdom of god in your hearts this righteousness which is the gift and work of god the image of god renewed in your souls and all these things shall be added unto you all things needful for the body such a measure of all as god sees most for the advancement of his kingdom these shall be added  they shall be thrown in over and above in seeking the peace and the love of god you shall not only find what you more immediately seek even the kingdom that cannot be moved but also what you seek not  not at all for its own sake but only in reference to the other you shall find in your way to the kingdom all outward things so far as they are expedient for you this care god hath taken upon himself cast you all your care upon him heknoweth your wants and whatsoever is lacking he will not fail to supply therefore take no thought for the morrow not only take ye no thought how to lay up treasures on earth how to increase in worldly substance take no thought how to procure more food than you can eat or more raiment than you can put on or more money than is required from day to day for the plain reasonable purposes of life  but take no uneasy thought even concerning those things which are absolutely needful for the body do not trouble yourself now with thinking what you shall do at a season which is yet afar off perhaps that season will never come or it will be no concern of yours  before then you will have passed through all the waves and be landed in eternity all those distant views do not belong to you who are but a creature of a day nay what have you to do with the   morrow more strictly speaking why should you perplex yourself without need god provides for you today what is needful to sustain the life which he hath given you it is enough give yourself up into his hands if you live another day he will provide for that also 25 above all do not make the care of future things a pretence for neglecting present duty this is the most fatal way of taking thought for the morrow and how common is it among men many if we exhort them to keep a conscience void of offence to abstain from what they are convinced is evil do not scruple to reply how then must we live must we not take care of ourselves and of our families and this they imagine to be a sufficient reason for continuing in known wilful sin they say and perhaps think they would serve god now were it not that they should by and by lose their bread they would prepare for eternity but they are afraid of wanting the necessaries of life so they serve the devil for a morsel of bread they rush into hell for fear of want they throw away their poor souls lest they should some time or other fall short of what is needful for their bodies it is not strange that they who thus take the matter out of gods hand should be so often disappointed of the very things they seek that while they throw away heaven to secure the things of earth they lose the one but do not gain the other the jealous god in the wise course of his providence frequently suffers this so that they who will not cast their care on god who taking thought for temporal things have little concern for things eternal lose the very portion which they have chosen there is a visible blast on all their undertakings whatsoever they do it doth not prosper insomuch that after they have forsaken god for the world they lose what they sought as well as what they sought not they fall short of the kingdom of god and his righteousness nor yet are other things added unto them  26 there is another way of taking thought for the morrow which is equally forbidden in these words it is possible to take thought in a wrong manner even with regard to spiritual things to be so careful about what may be by and by as to neglect what is now required at our hands how insensibly do we slide into this if we are not continually watching unto prayer how easily are we carried away in a kind of waking dream projecting distant schemes and drawing fine scenes in our own imagination we think what good we will do when we are in such a place or when such a time is come how useful we will be how plenteous in good works when we are easier in our circumstances how earnestly we will serve god when once such an hindrance is out of the way or perhaps you are now in heaviness of soul god as it were hides his face from you you see little of the light of his countenance you cannot taste his redeeming love in such a temper of mind how natural is it to say o how i will praise god when the light of his countenance shall be again lifted up upon my soul how will i exhort others to praise him when his love is again shed abroad in my heart then i will do thus and thus i will speak for god in all places i will not be ashamed of the gospel of christ then i will redeem the time i will use to the uttermost every talent i have received do not believe thyself thou wilt not do it then unless thou doest it now he that is faithful in that which is little of whatsoever kind it be whether it be worldly substance or the fear or love of god will be faithful in that which is much but if thou nowhidest one talent in the earth thou wilt then hide five that is if ever they are given but there is small reason to expect they ever will indeed unto him that hath that is uses what he hath shall be given and he shall have more abundantly but from him that hath not that is uses not the grace which he hath already received whether in a larger or smaller degree shall be taken away even that which he hath 27 and take no thought for the temptations of tomorrow this also is a dangerous snare think not when such a temptation comes what shall i do how shall i stand i feel i have not power to resist i am not able to conquer that enemy most true you have not now the power which you do not now stand in need of you are not able at this time to conquer that enemy and at this time he does not assault you with the grace you have now you could not withstand the temptations which you have not but when the temptation comes the grace will come in greater trials you will have greater strength when sufferings abound the consolations of god will in the same proportion abound also so that in every situation the grace of god will be sufficient for you he doth not suffer you to be tempted today above that ye are able to bear and in every temptation he will make a way to escape as thy days so thy strength shall be   let the morrow therefore take thought for the things of itself that is when the morrow comes then think of it live thou today be it thy earnest care to improve the present hour this is your own and it is your all the past is as nothing as though it had never been the future is nothing to you it is not yours perhaps it never will be there is no depending on what is yet to come for you know not what a day may bring forth therefore live today lose not an hour use this moment for it is your portion whoknoweth the things which have been before him or which shall be after him under the sun the generations that were from the beginning of the world where are they now fled away forgotten they were they lived their day they were shook off of the earth as leaves off of their trees they mouldered away into common dust another and another race succeeded then they followed the generation of their fathers and shall never more see the light now is thy turn upon the earth rejoice o young man in the days of thy youth enjoy the very very now by enjoying him whose years fail not now let thine eye be singly fixed on him in whom is no variableness neither shadow of turning now give him thy heart now stay thyself on him now be thou holy as he is holy now lay hold on the blessed opportunity of doing his acceptable and perfect will now rejoice to suffer the loss of all things so thou mayest win christ gladly suffer today for his names sake whatsoever he permits this day to come upon thee but look not at the sufferings of tomorrow sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof evil it is speaking after the manner of men whether it be reproach or want pain or sickness but in the language of god all is blessing it is a precious balm prepared by the wisdom of god and variously dispensed among his children according to the various sicknesses of their souls and he gives in one day sufficient for that day proportioned to the want and strength of the patient if therefore thou snatchest today what belongs to the morrow if thouaddest this to what is given thee already it will be more than thou canst bear this is the way not to heal but to destroy thy own soul take therefore just as much as he gives thee to day today do and suffer his will today give up thyself thy body soul and spirit to god through christ jesus desiring nothing but that god may be glorified in all thou art all thou doest all thou sufferest seeking nothing but to know god and his son jesus christ through the eternal spirit pursuing nothing but to love him to serve him and to enjoy him at this hour and to all eternity now unto god the father who hath made me and all the world unto god the son who hath redeemed me and all mankind unto god the holy ghost whosanctifieth me and all the elect people of god be honour and praise majesty and dominion for ever and ever amen   sermon 30 text of the 1872 edition upon our lords sermon on the mount discourse 10 judge not that ye be not judged for with what judgment ye judge ye shall be judged and with what measure ye mete it shall be measured to you again and whybeholdest thou the mote that is in thy brothers eye but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye or how wilt thou

father which is in heaven give good gifts to them that ask him therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you do ye even so to them for this is the law and the prophets matt 7112 our blessed lord having now finished his main design having first delivered the sum of true religion carefully guarded against those glosses of men whereby they would make the word of god of none effect and having next laid down rules touching that right intention which we are to preserve in all our outward actions now proceeds to point out the main hindrances of this religion and concludes all with a suitable application in the fifth chapter our great teacher has fully described inward religion in its various branches he has there laid before us those dispositions of soul which constitute real christianity the tempers contained in that holiness without which no man shall see the lord the affections which when flowing from their proper fountain from a living faith in god through christ jesus are intrinsically and essentially good and acceptable to god in the sixth he hath shown how all our actions likewise even those that are indifferent in their own nature may be made holy and good and acceptable to god by a pure and holy intention whatever is done without this he declares is of no value with god whereas whatever outward works are thus consecrated to god are in his sight of great price in the former part of this chapter he points out the most common and most fatal hindrances of this holiness in the latter he exhorts us by various motives to break through all and secure that prize of our high calling the first hindrance he cautions us against is judging judge not that ye be not judged judge not others that ye be not judged of the lord that ye bring not vengeance on your own heads for with what judgment ye judge ye shall be judged and with what measure ye mete it shall be measured to you again  a plain and equitable rule whereby god permits you to determine for yourselves in what manner he shall deal with you in the judgment of the great day there is no station of life nor any period of time from the hour of our first repenting and believing the gospel till we are made perfect in love wherein this caution is not needful for every child of god for occasions of judging can never be wanting and the temptations to it are innumerable many whereof are so artfully disguised that we fall into the sin before we suspect any danger and unspeakable are the mischiefs produced hereby  always to him that judges another thus wounding his own soul and exposing himself to the righteous judgment of god  and frequently to those who are judged whose hands hang down who are weakened and hindered in their course if not wholly turned out of the way and caused to turn back even to perdition yea how often when this root of   bitterness springs up are many defiled thereby by reason whereof the way of truth itself is evil spoken of and that worthy name blasphemed whereby we are called yet it does not appear that our lord designed this caution only or chiefly for the children of god but rather for the children of the world for the men who know not god these cannot but hear of those who are not of the world who follow after the religion above described who endeavour to be humble serious gentle merciful and pure in heart who earnestly desire such measures of these holy tempers as they have not yet attained and wait for them in doing all good to all men and patiently suffering evil whoever go but thus far cannot be hid no more than a city set upon a hill and why do not those who see their good works glorify their father which is in heaven what excuse have they for not treading in their steps  for not imitating their example and being followers of them as they are also of christ why in order to provide an excuse for themselves they condemn those whom they ought to imitate they spend their time in finding out their neighbours faults instead of amending their own they are so busied about others going out of the way that themselves never come into it at all at least never get forward never go beyond a poor dead form of godliness without the power  it is to these more especially that our lord says whybeholdest thou the mote that is in thy brothers eye  the infirmities the mistakes the imprudence the weakness of the children of god  but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye thouconsiderest not the damnable impenitence the satanic pride the accursed selfwill the idolatrous love of the world which are in thyself and which make thy whole life an abomination to the lord above all with what supine carelessness and indifference art thou dancing over the mouth of hell and how then with what grace with what decency or modesty wilt thou say to thy brother let me pull out the mote out of thine eye  the excess of zeal for god the extreme of selfdenial the too great disengagement from worldly cares and employments the desire to be day and night in prayer or hearing the words of eternal life  and behold a beam is in thine own eye not a mote like one of these thou hypocrite who pretendest to care for others and hast no care for thy own soul whomakest a show of zeal for the cause of god when in truth thou neitherlovest nor fearest him first cast out the beam out of thine own eye cast out the beam of impenitence know thyself see and feel thyself a sinner feel that thy inward parts are very wickedness that thou art altogether corrupt and abominable and that the wrath of god abideth on thee cast out the beam of pride abhor thyself sink down as in dust and ashes be more and more little and mean and base and vile in thine own eyes cast out the beam of selfwill learn what that meaneth if any man will come after me let him renounce himself deny thyself and take up thy cross daily let thy whole soul cry out i came down from heaven  for so thou didst thou neverdying spirit whether thouknowest it or no  not to do my own will but the will of him that sent me cast out the beam of love of the world love not the world neither the things of the world be thou crucified unto the world and the world crucified unto thee only use the world but enjoy god seek all thy happiness in him above all cast out the grand beam that supine carelessness and indifference deeply consider that one thing is needful the one thing which thou hast scarce ever thought of know and feel that thou art a poor vile guilty worm quivering over the great gulf what art thou a sinner born to die a leaf driven before the wind a vapour ready to vanish away just appearing and then scattered into air to be no more seen see this and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brothers eye then if thou hast leisure from the concerns of thy own soul thou shalt know how to correct thy brother also  but what is properly the meaning of this word judge not what is the judging which is here forbidden it is not the same as evilspeaking although it is frequently joined therewith evilspeaking is the relating anything that is evil concerning an absent person whereas judging may indifferently refer either to the absent or the present neither does it necessarily imply the speaking at all but only the thinking evil of another not that all kind of thinking evil of others is that judging which our lord condemns if i see one commit robbery or murder or hear him blaspheme the name of god i cannot refrain from thinking ill of the robber or murderer yet this is not evil judging there is no sin in this nor anything contrary to tender affection the thinking of another in a manner that is contrary to love is that judging which is here condemned and this maybe of various kinds for first we may think another to blame when he is not we may lay to his charge at least in our own mind the things of which he is not guilty the   words which he has never spoke or the actions which he has never done or we may think his manner of acting was wrong although in reality it was not and even where nothing can justly be blamed either in the thing itself or in the manner of doing it we may suppose his intention was not good and so condemn him on that ground at the same time that he who searches the heart sees his simplicity and godly sincerity but we may not only fall into the sin of judging by condemning the innocent but also secondly by condemning the guilty to a higher degree than he deserves this species of judging is likewise an offence against justice as well as mercy and yet such an offence as nothing can secure us from but the strongest and tenderest affection without this we readily suppose one who is acknowledged to be in fault to be more in fault than he really is we undervalue whatever good is found in him nay we are not easily induced to believe that anything good can remain in him in whom we have found anything that is evil  all this shows a manifest want of that love which ou logizetai kakon  thinketh no evil which never draws an unjust or unkind conclusion from any premises whatsoever love will not infer from a persons falling once into an act of open sin that he is accustomed so to do that he is habitually guilty of it and if he was habitually guilty once love does not conclude he is so still much less that if he is now guilty of this therefore he is guilty of other sins also these evilreasonings all pertain to that sinful judging which our lord here guards us against and which we are in the highest degree concerned to avoid if we love either god or our own souls but supposing we do not condemn the innocent neither the guilty any farther than they deserve still we may not be altogether clear of the snare for there is a third sort of sinful judging which is the condemning any person at all where there is not sufficient evidence and be the facts we suppose ever so true yet that does not acquit us for they ought not to have been supposed but proved and till they were we ought to have formed no judgment  i say till they were for neither are we excused although the facts admit of ever so strong proof unless that proof be produced before we pass sentence and compared with the evidence on the other side nor can we be excused if ever we pass a full sentence before the accused has spoken for himself even a jew might teach us this as a mere lesson of justice abstracted from mercy and brotherly love doth our law saysnicodemus judge any man before it hear him and know what he doeth john 751 yea a heathen could reply when the chief of the jewish nation desired to have judgment against his prisoner it is not the manner of the romans to judge any man before he that is accused have the accusers face to face and have licence to answer for himself concerning the crime laid against him indeed we could not easily fall into sinful judging were we only to observe that rule which another seneca of those heathen romans affirms to have been the measure of his own practice i am so far says he from lightly believing every mans or any mans evidence against another that i do not easily or immediately believe a mans evidence against himself i always allow him second i thoughts and many times counsel too go thou who art called a christian and do likewise lest the heathen rise and condemn thee in that day but how rarely should we condemn or judge one another at least how soon would that evil be remedied were we to walk by that clear and express rule which our lord himself has taught us  if thy brother shall trespass against thee or if thou hear or believe that he hath go and tell him of his fault between him and thee alone this is the first step thou art to take but if he will not hear take with thee one or two more that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established this is the second step if he neglect to hear them tell it unto the church either to the overseers thereof or to the whole congregation thou hast then done thy part then think of it no more but commend the whole to god but supposing thou hast by the grace of god cast the beam out of thine own eye and dost now clearly see the mote or the beam which is in thy brothers eye yet beware thou dost not receive hurt thyself by endeavouring to help him still give not that which is holy unto dogs do not lightly account any to be of this number but if it evidently appear that they deserve the title then cast ye not your pearls before swine beware of that zeal which is not according to knowledge for this is another great hindrance in their way who would be perfect as their heavenly father is perfect they   who desire this cannot but desire that all mankind should partake of the common blessing and when we ourselves first partake of the heavenly gift the divine evidence of things not seen we wonder that all mankind do not see the things which we see so plainly and make no doubt at all but we shall open the eyes of all we have any intercourse with hence we are for attacking all we meet without delay and constraining them to see whether they will or no and by the ill success of this intemperate zeal we often suffer in our own souls to prevent this spending our strength in vain our lord adds this needful caution needful to all but more especially to those who are now warm in their first love give not that which is holy unto the dogs neither cast ye your pearls before swine lest they trample them under foot and turn again and rend you give not that which is holy unto the dogs beware of thinking that any deserve this appellation till there is full and incontestable proof such as you can no longer resist but when it is clearly and indisputably proved that they are unholy and wicked men not only strangers to but enemies to god to all righteousness and true holiness give not that which is holy tohagion  the holy thing emphatically so called unto these the holy the peculiar doctrines of the gospel  such as were hid from the ages and generations of old and are now made known to us only by the revelation of jesus christ and the inspiration of his holy spirit  are not to be prostituted unto these men who know not if there be any holy ghost not indeed that the ambassadors of christ can refrain from declaring them in the great congregation wherein some of these may probably be we must speak whether men will hear or whether they will forbear but this is not the case with private christians they do not bear that awful character nor are they under any manner of obligation to force these great and glorious truths on them who contradict and blaspheme who have a rooted enmity against them nay they ought not so to do but rather to lead them as they are able to bear do not begin a discourse with these upon remission of sins and the gift of the holy ghost but talk with them in their own manner and upon their own principles with the rational honourable and unjust epicure reason of righteousness temperance and judgment to come this is the most probable way to make felix tremble reserve higher subjects for men of higherattainments neither cast ye your pearls before swine be very unwilling to pass this judgment on any man but if the fact be plain and undeniable if it is clear beyond all dispute if the swine do not endeavour to disguise themselves but rather glory in their shame making no pretence to purity either of heart or life but working all uncleanness with greediness then cast not ye your pearls before them talk not to them of the mysteries of the kingdom of the things which eye hath not seen nor ear heard which of consequence as they have no other inlets of knowledge no spiritual senses it cannot enter into their hearts to conceive tell not them of the exceeding great and precious promises which god hath given us in the son of his love what conception can they have of being made partakers of the divine nature who do not even desire to escape the corruption that is in the world through lust just as much knowledge as swine have of pearls and as much relish as they have for them so much relish have they for the deep things of god so much knowledge of the mysteries of the gospel who are immersed in the mire of this world in worldly pleasures desires and cares o cast not those pearls before these lest they trample them under their feet  lest they utterly despise what they cannot understand and speak evil of the things which they know not nay it is probable this would not be the only inconvenience which would follow it would not be strange if they were according to their nature to turn again and rend you if they were to return you evil for good cursing for blessing and hatred for your goodwill such is the enmity of the carnal mind against god and all the things of god such is the treatment you are to expect from these if you offer them the unpardonable affront of endeavouring to save their souls from death to pluck them as brands out of the burning and yet you need not utterly despair even of these who for the present turn again and rend you for if all your arguments and persuasives fail there is yet another remedy left and one that is frequently found effectual when no other method avails this is prayer therefore whatever you desire or want either for others or for your own soul ask and it shall be given you seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you the neglect of this is a third grand hindrance of holiness still we have not because we ask not o how meek and gentle how lowly in heart how full of love both to god and men might ye have been at this day if you had only asked  if you had continued instant in prayer therefore now at least ask and it shall be given unto you ask that ye may throughly experience and perfectly practise the whole of that religion which our lord has here so beautifully described it shall then be given you to be holy as he is holy both in heart and in all   manner of conversation seek in the way he hath ordained in searching the scriptures in hearing his word in meditating thereon in fasting in partaking of the supper of the lord and surely ye shall find ye shall find that pearl of great price that faith which overcometh the world that peace which the world cannot give that love which is the earnest of your inheritance knock continue in prayer and in every other way of the lord be not weary or faint in your mind press on to the mark take no denial let him not go until he bless you and the door of mercy of holiness of heaven shall be opened unto you  it is in compassion to the hardness of our hearts so unready to believe the goodness of god that our lord is pleased to enlarge upon this head and to repeat and confirm what he hath spoken for everyone saith he that asketh receiveth so that none need come short of the blessing and he that seeketh even everyone thatseeketh findeth the love and the image of god and to him that knocketh to everyone thatknocketh the gate of righteousness shall be opened so that here is no room for any to be discouraged as though they might ask or seek or knock in vain only remember always to pray to seek to knock and not to faint and then the promisestandeth sure it is firm as the pillars of heaven  yea more firm for heaven and earth shall pass away but his word shall not pass away  to cut off every pretence for unbelief our blessed lord in the following verses illustrates yet farther what he had said by an appeal to what passes in our own breasts what man saith he is there of you whom if his son ask bread will give him a stone will even natural affection permit you to refuse the reasonable request of one you love or if he ask a fish will he give him a serpent will he give him hurtful instead of profitable things so that even from what you feel and do yourselves you may receive the fullest assurance as on the one hand that no ill effect can possibly attend your asking so on the other that it will be attended with that good effect a full supply of all your wants for if ye being evil know i how to give good gifts unto your children how much more shall your father which is in heaven who is pure unmixed essential goodness give good things to them that ask him or as he expresses it on another occasion give the holy ghost to them that ask him in him are included all good things all wisdom peace joy love the whole treasures of holiness and happiness all that god hath prepared for them that love him but that your prayer may have its full weight with god see that ye be in charity with all men for otherwise it is more likely to bring a curse than a blessing on your own head nor can you expect to receive any blessing from god while you have not charity towards your neighbour therefore let this hindrance be removed without delay confirm your love towards one another and towards all men and love them not in word only but in deed and in truth therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you do ye even so to them for this is the law and the prophets this is that royal law that golden rule of mercy as well as justice which even the heathen emperor caused to be written over the gate of his palace a rule which many believe to be naturally engraved on the mind of everyone that comes into the world and thus much is certain that it commends itself as soon as heard to every mans conscience and understanding insomuch that no man can knowingly offend against it without carrying his condemnation in his own breast this is the law and the prophets whatsoever is written in that law which god of old revealed to mankind and whatsoever precepts god has given by his holy prophets which have been since the world began they are all summed up in these few words they are all contained in this short direction and this rightly understood comprises the whole of that religion which our lord came to establish upon earth it may be understood either in a positive or negative sense if understood in a negative sense the meaning is whatever ye would not that men should do to you do not ye unto them here is a plain rule always ready at hand always easy to be applied in all cases relating to your neighbour make his case your own suppose the circumstances to be changed and yourself to be just as he is now and then beware that you indulge no temper or thought that no word pass out of your lips that you take no step which you should have condemned in him upon such a change of circumstances if understood in a direct and positive sense the plain meaning of it is whatsoever you could   reasonably desire of him supposing yourself to be in his circumstances that do to the uttermost of your power to every child of man to apply this in one or two obvious instances it is clear to every mans own conscience we would not that others should judge us should causelessly or lightly think evil of us much less would we that any should speak evil of us  should publish our real faults or infirmities apply this to yourself do not unto another what you would not he should do unto you and you will never more judge your neighbour never causelessly or lightly think evil of anyone much less will you speak evil you will never mention even the real fault of an absent person unless so far as you are convinced it is absolutely needful for the good of other souls again we would that all men should love and esteem us and behave towards us according to justice mercy and truth and we may reasonably desire that they should do us all the good they can do without injuring themselves yea that in outward things according to the known rule their superfluities should give way to ourconveniencies their conveniencies to our necessities and their necessities to our extremities now then let us walk by the same rule let us do unto all as we would they should do to us let us love and honour all men let justice mercy and truth govern all our minds and actions let our superfluities give way to our neighboursconveniencies and who then will have any superfluities left ourconveniencies to our neighbours necessities our necessities to his extremities this is pure and genuine morality this do and thou shalt live as many as walk by this rule peace be to them and mercy for they are the israel of god but then be it observed none can walk by this rule nor ever did from the beginning of the world none can love his neighbour as himself unless he first love god and none can love god unless he believe in christ unless he have redemption through his blood and the spirit of god bearing witness with his spirit that he is a child of god faith therefore is still the root of all of present as well as future salvation still we must say to every sinner believe in the lord jesus christ and thou shalt be saved thou shalt be saved now that thou mayst be saved for ever saved on earth that thou mayst be saved in heaven believe in him and thy faith will work by love thou wilt love the lord thy god because he hath loved thee thou wilt love thy neighbour as thyself and then it will be thy glory and joy to exert and increase this love not barely by abstaining from what is contrary thereto from every unkind thought word and action but by showing all that kindness to every man which thou wouldst he should show unto thee   sermon 31 text of the 1872 edition upon our lords sermon on the mount discourse 11 enter ye in at the strait gate for wide is the gate and broad is the way whichleadeth to destruction and many there be which go in threat because strait is the gate and narrow is the way whichleadeth unto life and few there be that find it mat 713 14 our lord having warned us of the dangers which easily beset us at our first entrance upon real religion the hinderances which naturally arise from within from the wickedness of our own hearts now proceeds to apprize us of the hinderances from without particularly ill example and ill advice by one or the other of these thousands who once ran well have drawn back unto perdition  yea many of those who were not novices in religion who had made some progress in righteousness his caution therefore against these he presses upon us with all possible earnestness and repeats again and again in variety of expressions lest by any means we should let it slip thus effectually to guard us against the former enter ye in saith he at the strait gate for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leadeth to destruction and many there be which go in thereat because strait is the gate and narrow is the way which leadeth unto life and few there be that find it to secure us from the latter beware saith he of false prophets we shall at present consider the former only enter ye in saith our blessed lord at the strait gate for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leadeth to destruction and many there be which go in thereat because strait is the gate and narrow is the way which leadeth unto life and few there be that find it in these words we may observe first the inseparable properties of the way to hell wide is the gate broad the way that leadeth to destruction and many there be that go in thereat secondly the inseparable properties of the way to heaven strait is that gate and few there be that find it thirdly a serious exhortation grounded thereon enter ye in at the strait gate i 1 we may observe first the inseparable properties of the way to hell wide is the gate and broad is the way that leadeth to destruction and many there be that go in thereat wide indeed is the gate and broad the way thatleadeth to destruction for sin is the gate of hell and wickedness the way to destruction and how wide a gate is that of sin how broad is the way of wickedness the commandment of god is exceeding broad as extending not only to all our actions but to every word whichgoeth out of our lips yea every thought that rises in our heart and sin is equally broad with the commandment seeing any breach of the commandment is sin yea rather it is a thousand times broader since there is only one way of keeping the commandment for we do not properly keep it unless both the thing done the manner of doing it and all the other circumstances are right but there are a thousand ways of breaking every commandment so that this gate is wide indeed  to consider this a little more particularly how wide do those parentsins extend from which all the rest derive their being  that carnal mind which is enmity against god pride of heart selfwill and love of the world can we fix any bounds to them do they not diffuse themselves through all our thoughts and mingle with all our tempers are they not the leaven which leavens more or less the whole mass of our affections may we not on a close and faithful examination of ourselves perceive these roots of bitterness continually springing up infecting all our words and tainting all our actions and how innumerable an offspring do they bring forth in every age and nation even enough to cover the whole earth with darkness and cruel habitations o who is able to reckon up their accursed fruits to count all the sins whether against god or our neighbour not which imagination might paint but which may be matter of daily melancholy   experience nor need we range over all the earth to find them survey any one kingdom any single country or city or town and how plenteous is this harvest and let it not be one of those which are still overspread with mahometan or pagan darkness but of those which name the name of christ which profess to see the light of his glorious gospel go no farther than the kingdom to which we belong the city wherein we are now we call ourselves christians yea and that of the purest sort we are protestants reformed christians but alas who shall carry on the reformation of our opinions into our hearts and lives is there not a cause for how innumerable are our sins  and those of the deepest dye do not the grossest abominations of every kind abound among us from day to day do not sins of every sort cover the land as the waters cover the sea who can count them rather go and count the drops of rain or the sands on the seashore so wide is the gate so broad is the way that leadeth to destruction and many there are who go in at that gate many who walk in that way  almost as many as go in at the gate of death as sink into the chambers of the grave for it cannot be denied though neither can we acknowledge it but with shame and sorrow of heart that even in this which is called a christian country the generality of every age and sex of every profession and employment of every rank and degree high and low rich and poor are walking in the way of destruction the far greater part of the inhabitants of this city to this day live in sin in some palpable habitual known transgression of the law they profess to observe yea in some outward transgression some gross visible kind of ungodliness or unrighteousness some open violation of their duty either to god or man these then none can deny are all in the way that leadeth to destruction add to these those who have a name indeed that they live but were never yet alive to god those that outwardly appear fair to men but are inwardly full of all uncleanness full of pride or vanity of anger or revenge of ambition or covetousness lovers of themselves lovers of the world lovers of pleasure more than lovers of god these indeed may be highly esteemed of men but they are an abomination to the lord and how greatly will these saints of the world swell the number of the children of hell yea add all whatever they be in other respects whether they have more or less of the form of godliness who being ignorant of gods righteousness and seeking to establish their own righteousness as the ground of their reconciliation to god and acceptance with him of consequence have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness which is of god by faith now all these things joined together in one how terribly true is our lords assertion wide is the gate and broad is the way thatleadeth to destruction and many there be who go in thereat  nor does this only concern the vulgar herd  the poor base stupid part of mankind men of eminence in the world men who have many fields and yoke of oxen do not desire to be excused from this on the contrary many wise men after the flesh according to the human methods of judging many mighty in power in courage in riches many noble are called called into the broad way by the world the flesh and the devil and they are not disobedient to that calling yea the higher they are raised in fortune and power the deeper do they sink into wickedness the more blessings they have received from god the more sins do they commit using their honour or riches their learning or wisdom not as means of working out their salvation but rather of excelling in vice and so insuring their own destruction  ii 1 and the very reason why many of these go on so securely in the broad way is because it is broad not considering that this is the inseparable property of the way to destruction many there be saith our lord which go in thereat for the very reason why they should flee from it even because strait is the gate and narrow the way that leadeth unto life and few there be that find it this is an inseparable property of the way to heaven so narrow is the way thatleadeth unto life unto life everlasting  so strait the gate  that nothing unclean nothing unholy can enter no sinner can pass through that gate until he is saved from all his sins not only from his outward sins from his evil conversation received by tradition from his fathers it will not suffice that he hath ceased to do evil and learned to do well he must not only be saved from all sinful actions and from all evil and useless discourse but inwardly changed thoroughly renewed in the spirit of his mind otherwise he cannot pass through the gate of life he cannot enter into glory for narrow is the way that leadeth unto life the way of universal holiness narrow indeed is the way of poverty of spirit the way of holy mourning the way of meekness and that of hungering and   thirsting after righteousness narrow is the way of mercifulness of love unfeigned the way of purity of heart of doing good unto all men and of gladly suffering evil all manner of evil for righteousness sake  and few there be that find it alas how few find even the way of heathen honesty how few are there that do nothing to another which they would not another should do unto them how few that are clear before god from acts either of injustice or unkindness how few that do not offend with their tongue that speak nothing unkind nothing untrue what a small proportion of mankind are innocent even of outward transgressions and how much smaller a proportion have their hearts right before god  clean and holy in his sight where are they whom his allsearching eye discerns to be truly humble to abhor themselves in dust and ashes in the presence of god their saviour to be deeply and steadily serious feeling their wants and passing the time of their sojourning with fear truly meek and gentle never overcome of evil but overcoming evil with good thoroughly athirst for god and continually painting after a renewal in his likeness how thinly are they scattered over the earth whose souls are enlarged in love to all mankind and who love god with all their strength who have given him their hearts and desire nothing else in earth or heaven how few are those lovers of god and man that spend their whole strength in doing good unto all men and are ready to suffer all things yea death itself to save one soul from eternal death but while so few are found in the way of life and so many in the way of destruction there is great danger lest the torrent of example should bear us away with them even a single example if it be always in our sight is apt to make much impression upon us especially when it has nature on its side when it falls in with our own inclinations how great then must be the force of so numerous examples continually before our eyes and all conspiring together with our own hearts to carry us down the stream of nature how difficult must it be to stem the tide and to keep ourselves unspotted in the world  what heightens the difficulty still more is that they are not the rude and senseless part of mankind at least not these alone who set us the example who throng the downward way but the polite the wellbred the genteel the wise the men who understand the world the men of knowledge of deep and various learning the rational the eloquent these are all or nearly all against us and how shall we stand against these do not their tongues drop manna and have they not learned all the arts of soft persuasion  and of reasoning too for these are versed in all controversies and strife of words it is therefore a small thing with them to prove that the way is right because it is broad that he who follows a multitude cannot do evil but only he who will not follow them that your way must be wrong because it is narrow and because there are so few that find it these will make it clear to a demonstration that evil is good and good is evil that the way of holiness is the way of destruction and the way of the world the only way to heaven o how can unlearned and ignorant men maintain their cause against such opponents and yet these are not all with whom they must contend however unequal to the task for there are many mighty and noble and powerful men as well as wise in the road thatleadeth to destruction and these have a shorter way of confuting than that of reason and argument they usually apply not to the understanding but to the fears of any that oppose them  a method that seldom fails of success even where argument profits nothing as lying level to the capacities of all men for all can fear whether they can reason or no and all who have not a firm trust in god a sure reliance both on his power and love cannot but fear to give any disgust to those who have the power of the world in their hands what wonder therefore if the example of these is a law to all who know not god many rich are likewise in the broad way and these apply to the hopes of men and to all their foolish desires as strongly and effectually as the mighty and noble to their fears so that hardly can you hold on in the way of the kingdom unless you are dead to all below unless you are crucified to the world and the world crucified to you unless you desire nothing more but god for how dark how uncomfortable how forbidding is the prospect on the opposite side a strait gate a narrow way and few finding that gate few walking in the way besides even those few are not wise men not men of learning or eloquence they are not able to reason either strongly or clearly they cannot propose an argument to any advantage they know not how to prove what they profess to   believe or to explain even what they say they experience surely such advocates as these will never recommend but rather discredit the cause they have espoused 10 add to this that they are not noble not honourable men if they were you might bear with their folly they are men of no interest no authority of no account in the world they are mean and base low in life and such as have no power if they had the will to hurt you therefore there is nothing at all to be feared from them and there is nothing at all to hope for the greater part of them may say silver and gold have i none at least a very moderate share nay some of them have scarce food to eat or raiment to put on for this reason as well as because their ways are not like those of other men they are everywhere spoken against are despised have their names cast out as evil are variously persecuted and treated as the filth and offscouring of the world so that both your fears your hopes and all your desires except those which you have immediately from god yea all your natural passions continually incline you to return into the broad way iii 1 therefore it is that our lord so earnestly exhorts enter ye in at the strait gate or as the same exhortation is elsewhere expressed strive to enter in agonizesthe eiselthein  strive as in an agony for many saith our lord shall seek to enter in indolently strive and shall not be able  it is true he intimates what may seem another reason for this for their not being able to enter in in the words which immediately follow these for after he had said many i say unto you will seek to enter in and shall not be able he subjoins when once the master of the house is risen up and hath shut to the door and ye begin to stand without arxesthe exo estanai  rather ye stand without for arxesthe seems to be only an elegant expletive  and to knock at the door saying lord lord open unto us he shall answer and say unto you i know you not depart from me all ye workers of iniquity luke 1324 c it may appear upon a transient view of these words that their delaying to seek at all rather than their manner of seeking was the reason why they were not able to enter in but it comes in effect to the same thing they were therefore commanded to depart because they had been workers of iniquity because they had walked in the broad road in other words because they had notagonized to enter in at the strait gate probably they did seek before the door was shut but that did not suffice and they did strive after the door was shut but then it was too late therefore strive ye now in this your day to enter in at the strait gate and in order thereto settle it in your heart and let it be ever uppermost in your thoughts that if you are in a broad way you are in the way that leadeth to destruction if many go with you as sure as god is true both they and you are going to hell if you are walking as the generality of men walk you are walking to the bottomless pit are many wise many rich many mighty or noble travelling with you in the same way by this token without going any farther you know it does not lead to life here is a short a plain an infallible rule before you enter into particulars in whatever profession you are engaged you must be singular or be damned the way to hell has nothing singular in it but the way to heaven is singularity all over if you move but one step towards god you are not as other men are but regard not this it is far better to stand alone than to fall into the pit run then with patience the race which is set before thee though thy companions therein are but few they will not always be so yet a little while and thou wilt come to an innumerable company of angels to the general assembly and church of the firstborn and to the spirits of just men made perfect 5 now then strive to enter in at the strait gate being penetrated with the deepest sense of the inexpressible danger your soul is in so long as you are in a broad way  so long as you are void of poverty of spirit and all that inward religion which the many the rich the wise account madness strive to enter in being pierced with sorrow and shame for having so long run on with the unthinking crowd utterly neglecting if not despising that holiness without which no man can see the lord strive as in an agony of holy fear lest a promise being made you of entering into his rest even that rest whichremaineth for the people of god you should nevertheless come short of it strive in all the fervour of desire with groanings which cannot be uttered strive by prayer without ceasing at all times in all places lifting up your heart to god and giving him no rest till you awake up after his likeness and are satisfied with it 6 to conclude strive to enter in at the strait gate not only by this agony of soul of conviction of sorrow of shame of desire of fear of unceasing prayer but likewise by ordering thy   conversation aright by walking with all thy strength in all the ways of god the way of innocence of piety and of mercy abstain from all appearance of evil do all possible good to all men deny thyself thy own will in all things and take up thy cross daily be ready to cut off thy right hand to pluck out thy right eye and cast it from thee to suffer the loss of goods friends health all things on earth so thou mayst enter into the kingdom of heaven   sermon 32 text from the 1872 edition upon our lords sermon on the mount discourse 12 beware of false prophets which come to you in sheeps clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves ye shall know them by their fruits do men gather grapes of thorns or figs of thistles even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit but a corrupt treebringeth forth evil fruit a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit every tree thatbringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them matt 71520 it is scarce possible to express or conceive what multitudes of souls run on to destruction because they would not be persuaded to walk in a narrow way even though it were the way to everlasting salvation and the same thing we may still observe daily such is the folly and madness of mankind that thousands of men still rush on in the way to hell only because it is a broad way they walk in it themselves because others do because so many perish they will add to the number such is the amazing influence of example over the weak miserable children of men it continually peoples the regions of death and drowns numberless souls in everlasting perdition to warn mankind of this to guard as many as possible against this spreading contagion god has commanded his watchmen to cry aloud and show the people the danger they are in for this end he has sent his servants the prophets in their succeeding generations to point out the narrow path and exhort all men not to be conformed to this world but what if the watchmen themselves fall into the snare against which they should warn others what if the prophets prophesy deceits if they cause the people to err from the way what shall be done if they point out as the way to eternal life what is in truth the way to eternal death and exhort others to walk as they do themselves in the broad not the narrow way is this and unheardof is it an uncommon thing nay godknoweth it is not the instances of it are almost innumerable we may find them in every age and nation but how terrible is this  when the ambassadors of god turn agents for the devil  when they who are commissioned to teach men the way to heaven do in fact teach them the way to hell these are like the locusts of egypt which eat up the residue that had escaped that had remained after the hail they devour even the residue of men that had escaped that were not destroyed by ill example it is not therefore without cause that our wise and gracious master so solemnly cautions us against them beware saith he of false prophets which come to you in sheeps clothing but inwardly they are ravening wolves 4 a caution this of the utmost importance  that it may the more effectually sink into our hearts let us inquire first who these false prophets are secondly what appearance they put on and thirdly how we may know what they really are notwithstanding their fair appearance i 1 we are first to inquire who these false prophets are and this it is needful to do the more diligently because these very men have so laboured to wrest thiscripture to their own though not only their own destruction in order therefore to cut off all dispute i shall raise no dust as the manner of some is neither use any loose rhetorical exclamations to deceive the hearts of the simple but speak rough plain truths such as none can deny who has either understanding or modesty left and such truths as have the closest connexion with the whole tenor of the preceding discourse whereas too many have interpreted these words without any regard to all that went before as if they bore no manner of relation to the sermon in the close of which they stand 2 by prophets here as in many other passages of scripture particularly in the new testament are meant not those who foretell things to come but those who speak in the name of god those men who profess to be sent of god to teach others the way to heaven   those are false prophets who teach a false way to heaven a way which does not lead thither or which comes in the end to the same point who do not teach the true 3 every broad way is infallibly a false one therefore this is one plain sure rule they who teach men to walk in a broad way a way that many walk in are false prophets again the true way to heaven is a narrow way therefore this is another plain sure rule they who do not teach men to walk in a narrow way to be singular are false prophets 4 to be more particular the only true way to heaven is that pointed out in the preceding sermon therefore they are false prophets who do not teach men to walk in this way now the way to heaven pointed out in the preceding sermon is the way of lowliness mourning meekness and holy desire love of god and of our neighbour doing good and suffering evil for christs sake they are therefore false prophets who teach as the way to heaven any other way than this  it matters not what they call that other way they may call it faith or good works or faith and works or repentance or repentance faith and new obedience all these are good words but if under these or any other terms whatever they teach men any way distinct from this they are properly false prophets  how much more do they fall under that condemnation who speak evil of this good way  but above all they who teach the directly opposite way the way of pride of levity of passion of worldly desires of loving pleasure more than god of unkindness to our neighbour of unconcern for good works and suffering no evil no persecution for righteousness sake if it be asked why who ever did teach this or who does teach it as the way to heaven i answer ten thousand wise and honourable men even all those of whatever denomination who encourage the proud the trifler the passionate the lover of the world the man of pleasure the unjust or unkind the easy careless harmless useless creature the man who suffers no reproach for righteousness sake to imagine he is in the way to heaven these are false prophets in the highest sense of the word these are traitors both to god and man these are no other than the firstborn of satan the eldest sons of apollyon the destroyer these are far above the rank of ordinary cutthroats for they murder the souls of men they are continually peopling the realms of night and whenever they follow the poor souls whom they have destroyed hell shall be moved from beneath to meet them at their coming ii 1 but do they come now in their own shape by no means if it were so they could not destroy you would take the alarm and flee for your life therefore they put on a quite contrary appearance which was the second thing to be considered they come to you in sheeps clothing although inwardly they are ravening wolves they come to you in sheeps clothing that is with an appearance of harmlessness they come in the most mild inoffensive manner without any mark or token of enmity who can imagine that these quiet creatures would do any hurt to any one perhaps they may not be so zealous and active in doing good as one would wish they were however you see no reason to suspect that they have even the desire to do any harm but this is not all they come secondly with an appearance of usefulness indeed to this to do good they are particularly called they are set apart for this very thing they are particularly commissioned to watch over your soul and to train you up to eternal life it is their whole business to go about doing good and healing those that are oppressed of the devil and you have been always accustomed to look upon them in this light as messengers of god sent to bring you a blessing they come thirdly with an appearance of religion all they do is for conscience sake they assure you it is out of mere zeal for god that they are making god a liar it is out of pure concern for religion that they would destroy it root and branch all they speak is only from a love of truth and a   fear lest it should suffer and it may be from a regard for the church and a desire to defend her from all her enemies 5 above all they come with an appearance of love they take all these pains only for your good they should not trouble themselves about you but that they have a kindness for you they will make large professions of their goodwill of their concern for the danger you are in and of their earnest desire to preserve you from error from being entangled in new and mischievous doctrines they should be very sorry to see one who means so well hurried into any extreme perplexed with strange and unintelligible notions or deluded into enthusiasm therefore it is that they advise you to keep still in the plain middle way and to beware of being righteous overmuch lest you should destroy yourself  iii 1 but how may we know what they really are notwithstanding their fair appearance this was the third thing into which it was proposed to inquire our blessed lord saw how needful it was for all men to know false prophets however disguised he saw likewise how unable most men were to deduce a truth through a long train of consequences he therefore gives us a short and plain rule easy to be understood by men of the meanest capacities and easy to be applied upon all occasions ye shall know them by their fruits upon all occasions you may easily apply this rule in order to know whether any who speak in the name of god are false or true prophets it is easy to observe first what are the fruits of their doctrine as to themselves what effect has it had upon their lives are they holy andunblamable in all things what effect has it had upon their hearts does it appear by the general tenor of their conversation that their tempers are holy heavenly divine that the mind is in them which was in christ jesus that they are meek lowly patient lovers of god and man and zealous of good works you may easily observe secondly what are the fruits of their doctrine as to those that hear them  in many at least though not in all for the apostles themselves did not convert all that heard them have these the mind that was in christ and do they walk as he also walked and was it by hearing these men that they began so to do were they inwardly and outwardly wicked till they heard them if so it is a manifest proof that those are true prophets teachers sent of god but if it is not so if they do not effectually teach either themselves or others to love and serve god it is a manifest proof that they are false prophets that god hath not sent them a hard saying this how few can bear it this our lord was sensible of and therefore condescends to prove it at large by several clear and convincing arguments do men says he gather grapes of thorns or figs of thistles matt 716 do you expect that these evil men should bring forth good fruit as well might you expect that thorns should bring forth grapes or that figs should grow upon thistles every good treebringeth forth good fruit but a corrupt treebringeth forth evil fruit matt 517 every true prophet every teacher whom i have sentbringeth forth the good fruit of holiness but a false prophet a teacher whom i have not sent brings forth only sin and wickedness a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit a true prophet a teacher sent from god does not bring forth good fruit sometimes only but always not accidentally but by a kind of necessity in like manner a false prophet one whom god hath not sent does not bring forth evil fruit accidentally or sometimes only but always and of necessity every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire verse 19 such infallibly will be the lot of those prophets who bring not forth good fruit who do not save souls from sin who do not bring sinners to repentance wherefore let this stand as an eternal rule by their fruits ye shall know them matt 720 they who in fact bring the proud passionate unmerciful lovers of the world to be lowly gentle lovers of god and man  they are true prophets they are sent from god who therefore confirms their word on the other hand they whose hearers if unrighteous before remain unrighteous still or at least void of any righteousness which exceeds the righteousness of the scribes and pharisees  they are false prophets they are not sent of god therefore their word falls to the ground and without a miracle of grace they and their hearers together will fall into the bottomless pit  o beware of these false prophets for though they come in sheeps clothing yet inwardly they are ravening wolves they only destroy and devour the flock they tear them in pieces if there is   none to help them they will not cannot lead you in the way to heaven how should they when they know it not themselves o beware they do not turn you out of the way and cause you to lose what you have wrought but perhaps you will ask if there is such danger in hearing them ought i to hear them at all it is a weighty question such as deserves the deepest consideration and ought not to be answered but upon the calmest thought the most deliberate reflection for many years i have been almost afraid to speak at all concerning it being unable to determine one way or the other or to give any judgment upon it many reasons there are which readily occur and incline me to say hear them not and yet what our lord speaks concerning the false prophets of his own times seems to imply the contrary then spake jesus unto the multitude and to his disciples saying the scribes and thepharisees sit in moses seat  are the ordinary stated teachers in your church all therefore whatsoever they bid you observe that observe and do but do not ye after their works for they say and do not now that these were false prophets in the highest sense our lord hath shown during the whole course of his ministry as indeed he does in those very words they say and do not therefore by their fruits his disciples could not but know them seeing they were open to the view of all men accordingly he warns them again and again to beware of these false prophets and yet he does not forbid them to hear even these nay he in effect commands them so to do in those words all therefore whatsoever they bid you observe that observe and do for unless they heard them they could not know much less observe whatsoever they bade them do here then our lord himself gives a plain direction both to his apostles and the whole multitude in some circumstances to hear even false prophets known and acknowledged so to be  but perhaps it will be said he only directed to hear them when they read the scripture to the congregation i answer at the same time that they thus read the scripture they generally expounded it too and here is no kind of intimation that they were to hear the one and not the other also nay the very terms all things whatsoever they bid you observe exclude any such limitation again unto them unto false prophets undeniably such is frequently committed o grief to speak for surely these things ought not so to be the administration of the sacrament also to direct men therefore not to hear them would be in effect to cut them off from the ordinances of god but this we dare not do considering the validity of the ordinance doth not depend on the goodness of him that administers but on the faithfulness of him that ordained it who will and doth meet us in his appointed ways therefore on this account likewise i scruple to say hear not even the false prophets even by these who are under a curse themselves god can and doth give us his blessing for the bread which they break we have experimentally known to be the communion of the body of christ and the cup which god blessed even by their unhallowed lips was to us the communion of the blood of christ  all therefore which i can say is this in any particular case wait upon god by humble and earnest prayer and then act according to the best light you have act according to what you are persuaded upon the whole will be most for your spiritual advantage take great care that you do not judge rashly that you do not lightly think any to be false prophets and when you have full proof see that no anger or contempt have any place in your heart after this in the presence and in the fear of god determine for yourself i can only say if by experience you find that the hearing them hurts your soul then hear them not then quietly refrain and hear those that profit you if on the other hand you find it does not hurt your soul you then may hear them still only take heed how you hear beware of them and of their doctrine hear with fear and trembling lest you should be deceived and given up like them to a strong delusion as they continually mingle truth and lies how easily may you take in both together hear with fervent and continual prayer to him who aloneteacheth man wisdom and see that you bring whatever you hear to the law and to the testimony receive nothing untried nothing till it is weighed in the balance of the sanctuary believe nothing they say unless it is clearly confirmed by passages of holy writ wholly reject whatsoever differs therefrom whatever is not confirmed thereby and in particular reject with the utmost abhorrence whatsoever is described as the way of salvation that is either different from or short of the way our lord has marked out in the foregoing discourse   i cannot conclude without addressing a few plain words to those of whom we have now been speaking o ye false prophets o ye dry bones hear ye for once the word of the lord how long will ye lie in the name of god saying god hath spoken and god hath not spoken by you how long will ye pervert the right ways of the lord putting darkness for light and light for darkness how long will ye teach the way of death and call it the way of life how long will ye deliver to satan the souls whom ye profess to bring unto god woe unto you ye blind leaders of the blind for ye shut the kingdom of heaven against men ye neither go in yourselves neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in them that would strive to enter in at the strait gate ye call back into the broad way them that have scarce gone one step in the ways of god you devilishly caution against going too far them that just begin to hunger and thirst after righteousness you warn not to be righteous overmuch thus you cause them to stumble at the very threshold yea to fall and rise no more o wherefore do ye this what profit is there in their blood when they go down to the pit miserable profit to you they shall perish in their iniquity but their blood will god require at your hands where are your eyes where is your understanding have ye deceived others till you have deceived yourselves also who hath required this at your hands to teach a way which ye never knew are you given up to so strong a delusion that ye not only teach but believe a lie and can you possibly believe that god hath sent you that ye are his messengers nay if the lord had sent you the work of the lord would prosper in your hand as the lordliveth if ye were messengers of god he would confirm the word of his messengers but the work of the lord doth not prosper in your hand you bring no sinners to repentance the lord doth not confirm your word for you save no souls from death how can you possibly evade the force of our lords words  so full so strong so express how can ye evade knowing yourselves by your fruits  evil fruits of evil trees and how should it be otherwise do men gather grapes of thorns or figs of thistles take this to yourselves ye to whom it belongs o ye barren trees why cumber ye the ground every good treebringeth forth good fruit see ye not that here is no exception take knowledge then ye are not good trees for ye do not bring forth good fruit but a corrupt treebringeth forth evil fruit and so have ye done from the beginning your speaking as from god has only confirmed them that heard you in the tempers if not works of the devil o take warning of him in whose name ye speak before the sentence he hath pronounced take place every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire my dear brethren harden not your hearts you have too long shut your eyes against the light open them now before it is too late before you are cast into outer darkness let not any temporal consideration weigh with you for eternity is at stake ye have run before ye were sent o go no farther do not persist to damn yourselves and them that hear you you have no fruit of your labours and why is this even because the lord is not with you but can you go this warfare at your own cost it cannot be then humble yourselves before him cry unto him out of the dust that he may first quicken thy soul give thee the faith thatworketh by love that is lowly and meek pure and merciful zealous of good works rejoicing in tribulation in reproach in distress in persecution for righteousness sake so shall the spirit of glory and of christ rest upon thee and it shall appear that god hath sent thee so shalt thou indeed do the work of an evangelist and make full proof of thy ministry so shall the word of god in thy mouth be an hammer thatbreaketh the rocks in pieces it shall then be known by thy fruits that thou art a prophet of the lord even by the children whom god hath given thee and having turned many to righteousness thou shalt shine as the stars for ever and ever   sermon 33 upon our lords sermon on the mount text of the 1872 edition discourse 13 not everyone that saith unto me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven many will say to me in that day lord lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works and then will i profess unto them i never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity therefore whosoeverheareth these sayings of mine and doeth them i will liken him unto a wise man which built his house upon a rock and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell not for it was founded upon a rock and every one that heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them not shall be likened unto a foolish man which built his house upon the sand and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell and great was the fall of it matt 72127 our divine teacher having declared the whole counsel of god with regard to the way of salvation and observed the chief hindrances of those who desire to walk therein now closes the whole with these weighty words thereby as it were setting his seal to his prophecy and impressing his whole authority on what he had delivered that it might stand firm to all generations for thus saith the lord that none may ever conceive there is any other way than this not everyone that saith unto me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven many will say to me in that day lord lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works and then will i profess unto them i never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity therefore everyone that heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them not shall be likened unto a foolish man which built his house upon the sand and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell and great was the fall of it i design in the following discourse first to consider the case of him who thus builds his house upon the sand secondly to show the wisdom of him who builds upon a rock and thirdly to conclude with a practical application i 1 and first i am to consider the case of him who builds his house upon the sand it is concerning him our lord saith not everyone that saith unto me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven and this is a decree which cannot pass whichstandeth fast for ever and ever it therefore imports us in the highest degree throughly to understand the force of these words now what are we to understand by that expression that saith unto me lord lord it undoubtedly means that thinks of going to heaven by any other way than that which i have now described it therefore implies to begin at the lowest point all good words all verbal religion it includes whatever creeds we may rehearse whatever professions of faith we make whatever number of prayers we may repeat whatever thanksgivings we read or say to god we may speak good of his name and declare his lovingkindness to the children of men we may be talking of all his mighty acts and telling of his salvation from day to day by comparing spiritual things with spiritual we may show the meaning of the oracles of god we may explain the mysteries of his kingdom which have been hid from the beginning of the world we may speak with the tongue of angels rather than men concerning the deep things of god we may proclaim to sinners behold the lamb of god whotaketh away the sin of the world yea we may do this with such a measure of the power of god and such demonstration of his spirit as to save many souls from death and hide a multitude of sins and yet it is very possible all this may be no more than saying lord lord after i have thus successfully preached to others still i myself may be a castaway i may in the hand of god snatch many souls from hell and   yet drop into it when i have done i may bring many others to the kingdom of heaven and yet myself never enter there reader if god hath ever blessed my word to thy soul pray that he may be merciful to me a sinner the saying lord lord may secondly imply the doing no harm we may abstain from every presumptuous sin from every kind of outward wickedness we may refrain from all those ways of acting or speaking which are forbidden in holy writ we may be able to say to all those among whom we live which of youconvinceth me of sin we may have a conscience void of any external offence towards god and towards man we may be clear of alluncleanness ungodliness and unrighteousness as to the outward act or as the apostle testifies concerning himself touching the righteousness of the law that is outward righteousness blameless but yet we are not hereby justified still this is no more than saying lord lord and if we go no farther than this we shall never enter into the kingdom of heaven the saying lord lord may imply thirdly many of what are usually styled good works a man may attend the supper of the lord may hear abundance of excellent sermons and omit no opportunity of partaking all the other ordinances of god i may do good to my neighbour deal my bread to the hungry and cover the naked with a garment i may be so zealous of good works as even to give all my goods to feed the poor yea and i may do all this with a desire to please god and a real belief that i do please him thereby which is undeniably the case of those our lord introduces saying unto him lord lord and still i may have no part in the glory which shall be revealed if any man marvels at this let him acknowledge he is a stranger to the whole religion of jesus christ and in particular to that perfect portraiture thereof which he has set before us in this discourse for how far short is all this of that righteousness and true holiness which he has described therein how widely distant from that inward kingdom of heaven which is now opened in the believing soul  which is first sown in the heart as a grain of mustardseed but afterwardsputteth forth great branches on which grow all the fruits of righteousness every good temper and word and work  yet as clearly as he had declared this as frequently as he had repeated that none who have not this kingdom of god within them shall enter into the kingdom of heaven our lord well knew that many would not receive this saying and therefore confirms it yet again many saith he not one not a few only it is not a rare or an uncommon case shall say unto me in that day not only we have said many prayers we have spoken thy praise we have refrained from evil we have exercised ourselves in doing good  but what is abundantly more than this we have prophesied in thy name in thy name have we cast out devils in thy name done many wonderful works we have prophesied  we have declared thy will to mankind we have showed sinners the way to peace and glory and we have done this in thy name according to the truth of thy gospel yea and by thy authority who didst confirm the word with the holy ghost sent down from heaven for in or by thy name by the power of thy word and of thy spirit have we cast out devils out of the souls which they had long claimed as their own and whereof they had full and quiet possession and in thy name by thy power not our own have we done many wonderful works insomuch that even the dead heard the voice of the son of god speaking by us and lived and then will i profess even unto them i never knew you no not then when you were casting out devils in my name even then i did not know you as my own for your heart was not right toward god ye were not yourselves meek and lowly ye were not lovers of god and of all mankind ye were not renewed in the image of god ye were not holy as i am holy depart from me ye who notwithstanding all this are workers of iniquity  anomia  ye are transgressors of my law my law of holy and perfect love it is to put this beyond all possibility of contradiction that our lord confirms it by that apposite comparison every one saith he whoheareth these sayings of mine and doeth them not shall be likened unto a foolish man which built his house upon the sand and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house  as they will surely do sooner or later upon every soul of man even the floods of outward affliction or inward temptation the storms of pride anger fear or desire  and it fell and great was the fall of it so that it perished for ever and ever such must be the portion of all who rest in anything short of that religion which is above   described and the greater will their fall be because they heard those sayings and yet did them not ii 1 i am secondly to show the wisdom of him that doeth them thatbuildeth his house upon a rock he indeed is wise who doeth the will of my father which is in heaven he is truly wise whose righteousness exceeds the righteousness of the scribes andpharisees he is poor in spirit knowing himself even as also he is known he sees and feels all his sin and all his guilt till it is washed away by the atoning blood he is conscious of his lost estate of the wrath of god abiding on him and of his utter inability to help himself till he is filled with peace and joy in the holy ghost he is meek and gentle patient toward all men never returning evil for evil or railing for railing but contrariwise blessing till he overcomes evil with good his soul is athirst for nothing on earth but only for god the living god he has bowels of love for all mankind and is ready to lay down his life for his enemies he loves the lord his god with all his heart and with all his mind and soul and strength he alone shall enter into the kingdom of heaven who in this spirit doeth good unto all men and who being for this cause despised and rejected of men being hated reproached and persecuted rejoices and is exceeding glad knowing in whom he hath believed and being assured these light momentary afflictions will work out for him an eternal weight of glory how truly wise is this man he knows himself  an everlasting spirit which came forth from god and was sent down into an house of clay not to do his own will but the will of him that sent him he knows the world  the place in which he is to pass a few days or years not as an inhabitant but as a stranger and sojourner in his way to the everlasting habitations and accordingly he uses the world as not abusing it and as knowing the fashion of it passes away he knows god  his father and his friend the parent of all good the centre of the spirits of all flesh the sole happiness of all intelligent beings he sees clearer than the light of the noonday sun that this is the end of man to glorify him who made him for himself and to love and enjoy him for ever and with equal clearness he sees the means to that end to the enjoyment of god in glory even now to know to love to imitate god and to believe in jesus christ whom he hath sent he is a wise man even in gods account for hebuildeth his house upon a rock upon the rock of ages the everlasting rock the lord jesus christ fitly is he so called for hechangeth not he is the same yesterday and today and for ever to him both the man of god of old and the apostle citing his words bear witness thou lord in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth and the heavens are the works of thine hands they shall perish but thouremainest and they all shall wax old as doth a garment and as a vesture shalt thou fold them up and they shall be changed but thou art the same and thy years shall not fail heb 11012 wise therefore is the man whobuildeth on him who layeth him for his only foundation who builds only upon his blood and righteousness upon what he hath done and suffered for us on this cornerstone he fixes his faith and rests the whole weight of his soul upon it he is taught of god to say lord i have sinned i deserve the nethermost hell but i am justified freely by thy grace through the redemption that is in jesus christ and the life i now live i live by faith in him who loved me and gave himself for me  the life i now live namely a divine heavenly life a life which is hid with christ in god i now live even in the flesh a life of love of pure love both to god and man a life of holiness and happiness praising god and doing all things to his glory yet let not such an one think that he shall not see war any more that he is now out of the reach of temptation it still remains for god to prove the grace he hath given he shall be tried as gold in the fire he shall be tempted not less than they who know not god perhaps abundantly more for satan will not fail to try to the uttermost those whom he is not able to destroy accordingly the rain will impetuously descend only at such times and in such a manner as seems good not to the prince of the power of the air but to him whose kingdomruleth over all the floods or torrents will come they will lift up their waves and rage horribly but to them also the lord thatsitteth above the waterfloods that remaineth a king for ever will say hitherto shall ye come and no farther here shall your proud waves be stayed the winds will blow and beat upon that house as though they would tear it up from the foundation but they cannot prevail itfalleth not for it is founded upon a rock he buildeth on christ by faith and love therefore he shall not be cast down he shall not fear though the earth be moved and though the hills be carried into the midst of the sea though the waters   thereof rage and swell and the mountains shake at the tempest of the same still he dwelleth under the defence of the most high and is safe under the shadow of the almighty iii 1 how nearly then does it concern every child of man practically to apply these things to himself diligently to examine on what foundation he builds whether on a rock or on the sand how deeply are you concerned to inquire what is the foundation of my hope whereon do i build my expectation of entering into the kingdom of heaven is it not built on the sand upon my orthodoxy or right opinions which by a gross abuse of words i have called faith upon my having a set of notions suppose more rational or scriptural than others have alas what madness is this surely this is building on the sand or rather on the froth of the sea say i am convinced of this am i not again building my hope on what is equally unable to support it perhaps on my belonging to so excellent a church reformed after the true scripture model blessed with the purest doctrine the most primitive liturgy the most apostolical form of government these are doubtless so many reasons for praising god as they may be so many helps to holiness but they are not holiness itself and if they are separate from it they will profit me nothing nay they will leave me the more without excuse and exposed to the greater damnation therefore if i build my hope upon this foundation i am still building upon the sand  you cannot you dare not rest here upon what next will you build your hope of salvation  upon your innocence upon your doing no harm your not wronging or hurting anyone well allow this plea to be true you are just in all your dealings you are a downright honest man you pay every man his own you neither cheat nor extort you act fairly with all mankind and you have a conscience towards god you do not live in any known sin thus far is well but still it is not the thing you may go thus far and yet never come to heaven when all this harmlessness flows from a right principle it is the least part of the religion of christ but in you it does not flow from a right principle and therefore is no part at all of religion so that in grounding your hope of salvation on this you are still building upon the sand  do you go farther yet do you add to the doing no harm the attending all the ordinances of god do you at all opportunities partake of the lords supper use public and private prayer fast often hear and search the scriptures and meditate thereon these things likewise ought you to have done from the time you first set your face towards heaven yet these things also are nothing being alone they are nothing without the weightier matters of the law and those you have forgotten at least you experience them not  faith mercy and love of god holiness of heart heaven opened in the soul still therefore you build upon the sand over and above all this are you zealous of good works do you as you have time do good to all men do you feed the hungry and clothe the naked and visit the fatherless and widow in their affliction do you visit those that are sick relieve them that are in prison is any a stranger and you take him in friend come up higher do you prophesy in the name of christ do you preach the truth as it is in jesus and does the influence of his spirit attend your word and make it the power of god unto salvation does he enable you to bring sinners from darkness to light from the power of satan unto god then go and learn what thou hast so often taught by grace ye are saved through faith not by works of righteousness which we have done but of his own mercy hesaveth us learn to hang naked upon the cross of christ counting all thou hast done but dung and dross apply to him just in the spirit of the dying thief of the harlot with her seven devils else thou art still on the sand and after saving others thou wilt lose thy own soul lord increase my faith if i now believe else give me faith though but as a grain of mustardseed  but what doth it profit if a man say he hath faith and have not works can that faith save him o no that faith which hath not works which doth not produce both inward and outward holiness which does not stamp the whole image of god on the heart and purify us as he is pure that faith which does not produce the whole of the religion described in the foregoing chapters is not the faith of the gospel not the christian faith not the faith which leads to glory o beware of this above all other snares of the devil  of resting on unholyunsaving faith if thou layest stress on this thou art lost for ever thou still buildest thy house upon the sand when the rain descends and the floods come it will surely fall and great will be the fall of it   now therefore build thou upon a rock by the grace of god know thyself know and feel that thou wast shapen in wickedness and in sin did thy mother conceive thee and that thou thyself hast been heaping sin upon sin ever since thou couldst discern good from evil own thyself guilty of eternal death and renounce all hope of ever being able to save thyself be it all thy hope to be washed in his blood and purified by his spirit who himself bore all thy sins in his own body upon the tree and if thou knowest he hath taken away thy sins so much the more abase thyself before him in a continual sense of thy total dependence on him for every good thought and word and work and of thy utter inability to all good unless he water thee every moment now weep for your sins and mourn after god till he turns your heaviness into joy and even then weep with them that weep and for them that weep not for themselves mourn for the sins and miseries of mankind and see but just before your eyes the immense ocean of eternity without a bottom or a shore which has already swallowed up millions of millions of men and is gaping to devour them that yet remain see here the house of god eternal in the heavens there hell and destruction without a covering  and thence learn the importance of every moment which just appears and is gone for ever  now add to your seriousness meekness of wisdom hold an even scale as to all your passions but in particular as to anger sorrow and fear calmly acquiesce in whatsoever is the will of god learn in every state wherein you are therewith to be content be mild to the good be gentle toward all men but especially toward the evil and the unthankful beware not only of outward expressions of anger such as calling thy brother raca or thou fool but of every inward emotion contrary to love though it go no farther than the heart be angry at sin as an affront offered to the majesty of heaven but love the sinner still like our lord who looked round about upon thepharisees with anger being grieved for the hardness of their hearts he was grieved at the sinners angry at sin thus be thou angry and sin not  now do thou hunger and thirst not for the meat thatperisheth but for that which endureth unto everlasting life trample underfoot the world and the things of the world all these riches honours pleasures what is the world to thee let the dead bury their dead but follow thou after the image of god and beware of quenching that blessed thirst if it is already excited in thy soul by what is vulgarly called religion a poor dull farce a religion of form of outside show which leaves the heart still cleaving to the dust as earthly and sensual as ever let nothing satisfy thee but the power of godliness but a religion that is spirit and life the dwelling in god and god in thee the being an inhabitant of eternity the entering in by the blood of sprinkling within the veil and sitting in heavenly places with christ jesus now seeing thou canst do all things through christ strengthening thee be merciful as thy father in heaven is merciful love thy neighbour as thyself love friends and enemies as thy own soul and let thy love be longsuffering and patient towards all men let it be kind soft benign inspiring thee with the most amiable sweetness and the most fervent and tender affection let it rejoice in the truth wheresoever it is found the truth that is after godliness enjoy whatsoever brings glory to god and promotes peace and goodwill among men in love cover all things  of the dead and the absent speaking nothing but good believe all things which may any way tend to clear your neighbours character hope all things in his favour and endure all things triumphing over all opposition for true love never faileth in time or in eternity now be thou pure in heart purified through faith from every unholy affection cleansing thyself from all filthiness of flesh and spirit and perfecting holiness in the fear of god being through the power of his grace purified from pride by deep poverty of spirit from anger from every unkind or turbulent passion by meekness and mercifulness from every desire but to please and enjoy god by hunger and thirst after righteousness now love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy strength in a word let thy religion be the religion of the heart let it lie deep in thy inmost soul be thou little and base and mean and vile beyond what words can express in thy own eyes amazed and humbled to the dust by the love of god which is in christ jesus be serious let the whole stream of thy thoughts words and actions flow from the deepest conviction that thoustandest on the edge of the   great gulf thou and all the children of men just ready to drop in either into everlasting glory or everlasting burnings let thy soul be filled with mildness gentleness patience longsuffering towards all men  at the same time that all which is in thee is athirst for god the living god longing to awake up after his likeness and to be satisfied with it be thou a lover of god and of all mankind in this spirit do and suffer all things thus show thy faith by thy works thus do the will of thy father which is in heaven and as sure as thou nowwalkest with god on earth thou shalt also reign with him in glory   sermon 34 text from the 1872 edition the original nature property and use of the law wherefore the law is holy and the commandment holy and just and goodrom 712 perhaps there are few subjects within the whole compass of religion so little understood as this the reader of this epistle is usually told by the law st paul means the jewish law and so apprehending himself to have no concern therewith passes on without farther thought about it indeed some are not satisfied with this account but observing the epistle is directed to the romans thence infer that the apostle in the beginning of this chapter alludes to the old roman law but as they have no more concern with this than with the ceremonial law ofmoses so they spend not much thought on what they suppose is occasionally mentioned barely to illustrate another thing but a careful observer of the apostles discourse will not be content with theses light explications of it and the more he weighs the words the more convinced he will be that st paul by the law mentioned in this chapter does not mean either the ancient law of rome or the ceremonial law of moses this will clearly appear to all who attentively consider the tenor of his discourse he begins the chapter know ye not brethren for i speak to them that know the law to them who have been instructed therein from their youth that the law hath dominion over a man as long as heliveth what the law of rome only or the ceremonial law no surely but the moral law for to give a plain instance the woman which hath an husband is bound by the moral law to her husband so long as he liveth but if the husband be dead she is loosed from the law of her husband so then if while her husband liveth she be married to another man she shall be called an adulteress but if her husband be dead she is free from that law so that she is no adulteress though she be married to another man from this particular instance the apostle proceeds to draw that general conclusion wherefore my brethren by a plain parity of reason ye also are become dead to the law the whole mosaic institution by the body of christ offered for you and bringing you under a new dispensation that ye should without any blame be married to another even to him who is raised from the dead and hath thereby given proof of his authority to make the change that we should bring forth fruit unto god and this we can do now whereas before we could not for when we were in the flesh  under the power of the flesh that is of corrupt nature which was necessarily the case till we knew the power of christs resurrection the motions of sins which were by the law  which were shown and inflamed by the mosaic law not conquered did work in our members  broke out various ways to bring forth fruit unto death but now we are delivered from the law from that whole moral as well as ceremonial economy that being dead whereby we were held  that entire institution being now as it were dead and having no more authority over us than the husband when dead hath over his wife that we should serve him  who died for us and rose again in newness of spirit  in a new spiritual dispensation and not in the oldness of the letter  with a bare outward service according to the letter of the mosaic institution rom 716  the apostle having gone thus far in proving that the christian had set aside the jewish dispensation and that the moral law itself though it could never pass away yet stood on a different foundation from what it did before  now stops to propose and answer an objection what shall we say then is the law sin so some might infer from a misapprehension of those words the motions of sins which were by the law god forbid saith the apostle that we should say so nay the law is an irreconcilable enemy to sin by the law for i had not known lust evil desire to be sin except the law had said thou shalt not covet rom 77 after opening this farther in the four following verses he subjoins this general conclusion with regard more especially to the moral law form which the preceding instance was taken wherefore the law is holy and the commandment holy and just and good in order to explain and enforce these deep words so little regarded because so little understood i shall endeavour to show first the original of this law secondly the nature thereof thirdly the properties that it is holy and just and good and fourthly the uses of it   i 1 i shall first endeavour to show the original of the moral law often called the law by way of eminence now this is not as some may have possibly imagined of so late an institution as the time of moses noah declared it to men long before that time andenoch before him but we may trace its original higher still even beyond the foundation of the world to that period unknown indeed to men but doubtless enrolled in the annals of eternity when the morning stars first sang together being newly called into existence it pleased the great creator to make these his firstborn sons intelligent beings that they might know him that created them for this end he endued them with understanding to discern truth from falsehood good from evil and as a necessary result of this with liberty  a capacity of choosing the one and refusing the other by this they were likewise enabled to offer him a free and willing service a service rewardable in itself as well as most acceptable to their gracious master  to employ all the faculties which he had given them particularly their understanding and liberty he gave the a law a complete model of all truth so far as is intelligible to a finite being and of all good so far as angelic minds were capable of embracing it it was also the design of their beneficent governor herein to make way for a continual increase of their happiness seeing every instance of obedience to that law would both add to the perfection of their nature and entitle them to an higher reward which the righteous judge would give in its season in like manner when god in his appointed time had created a new order of intelligent beings when he had raised man form the dust of the earth breathed into him the breath of life and caused him to become a living soul endued with power to choose good or evil he gave to this free intelligent creature the same law as to his firstborn children  not wrote indeed upon tables of stone or any corruptible substance butengraven on his heart by the finger of god wrote in the inmost spirit both of men and of angels to the intent it might never be far off never hard to be understood but always at hand and always shining with clear light even as the sun in the midst of heaven such was the original of the law of god with regard to man it was coeval with his nature but with regard to the elder sons of god it shone in its full splendour or ever the mountains were brought forth or the earth and the round world were made but it was not long before man rebelled against god and by breaking this glorious law wellnigh effaced it out of his heart the eyes of his understanding being darkened in the same measure as his soul was alienated from the life of god and yet god did not despise the work of his own hands but being reconciled to man through the son of his love he in some measure reinscribed the law on the heart of his dark sinful creature he again showed thee o man what is good although not as in the beginning even to do justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with thy god and this he showed not only to our first parents but likewise to all their posterity by that true light which enlightens every man that cometh into the world but notwithstanding this light all flesh had in process of time corrupted their way before him till he chose out of mankind a peculiar people to whom he gave a more perfect knowledge of his law and the heads of this because they were slow of understanding he wrote on two tables of stone which he commanded the fathers to teach their children through all succeeding generations and thus it is that the law of god is now made known to them that know not god they hear with the hearing of the ear the things that were written aforetime for our instruction but this does not suffice they cannot by this means comprehend the height and depth and length and breadth thereof god alone can reveal this by his spirit and so he does to all that truly believe in consequence of that gracious promise made to all the israel of god behold the days come saith the lord that i will make a new covenant with the house of israel and this shall be the covenant that i will make i will put my law in their inward parts and write it in their hearts and i will be their god and they shall be my people jer 3131  c ii 1 the nature of that law which was originally given to angels in heaven and man in paradise and which god has so mercifully promised to write afresh in the hearts of all true believers was the second thing i proposed to show in order to which i would first observe that although the law and the commandment are sometimes differently taken the commandment meaning but a part of the   law yet in the text they are used as equivalent terms implying one and the same thing but we cannot understand here either by one or the other the ceremonial law it is not the ceremonial law whereof the apostle says in the words above recited i had not known sin but by the law this is too plain to need a proof neither is it the ceremonial law which saith in the words immediately subjoined thou shalt not covet therefore the ceremonial law has no place in the present question neither can we understand by the law mentioned in the text the mosaic dispensation it is true the word is sometimes so understood as when the apostle says speaking to thegalatians gal 317 the covenant that was confirmed before namely withabraham the father of the faithful the law that is the mosaic dispensation which was four hundred and thirty years after cannot disannul but it cannot be so understood in the text for the apostle never bestows so high commendations as these upon that imperfect and shadowy dispensation he nowhere affirms the mosaic to be a spiritual law or that it is holy and just and good neither is it true that god will write that law in the hearts of those whose iniquities he remembers no more it remains that the law eminently so termed is no other than the moral law now this law is an incorruptible picture of the high and holy one thatinhabiteth eternity it is he whom in his essence no man hath seen or can see made visible to men and angels it is the face of god unveiled god manifested to his creatures as they are able to bear it manifested to give and not to destroy life  that they may see god and live it is the heart of god disclosed to man yea in some sense we may apply to this law what the apostle says of his son it is apaugasma tes doxes kai charakter tes hypostaseos autou  the streaming forth or outbeaming of his glory the express image of his person if virtue said the ancient heathen could assume such a shape as that we could behold her with our eyes what wonderful love would she excite in us if virtue could do this it is done already the law of god is all virtues in one in such a shape as to be beheld with open face by all those whose eyes god hath enlightened what is the law but divine virtue and wisdom assuming a visible form what is it but the original ideas of truth and good which were lodged in the uncreated mind from eternity now drawn forth and clothed with such a vehicle as to appear even to human understanding if we survey the law of god in another point of view it is supreme unchangeable reason it is unalterable rectitude it is the everlasting fitness of all things that are or ever were created i am sensible what a shortness and even impropriety there is in these and all other human expressions when we endeavour by these faint pictures to shadow out the deep things of god nevertheless we have no better indeed no other way during this our infant state of existence as we now know but in part so we are constrained to prophesy that is speak of the things of god in part also we cannot order our speech by reason of darkness while we are in this house of clay while i am a child i must speak as a child but i shall soon put away childish things for when that which is perfect is come that which is in part shall be done away but to return the law of god speaking after the manner of men is a copy of the eternal mind a transcript of the divine nature yea it is the fairest offspring of the everlasting father the brightest efflux of his essential wisdom the visible beauty of the most high it is the delight and wonder of cherubim and seraphim and all the company of heaven and the glory and joy of every wise believer every wellinstructed child of god upon earth iii 1 such is the nature of the everblessed law of god i am in the third place to show the properties of it  not all for that would exceed the wisdom of an angel but those only which are mentioned in the text these are three it is holy just and good and first the law is holy 2 in this expression the apostle does not appear to speak of its effects but rather of its nature as st james speaking of the same thing under another name says the wisdom from above which is no other than this law written in our heart is first pure jas 317 agne  chaste spotless eternally and essentially holy and consequently when it is transcribed into the life as well as the soul it is as the same apostle terms it jas 127 threskeia kathara kai amiantos  pure religion and undefiled or the pure clean unpolluted worship of god   it is indeed in the highest degree pure chaste clean holy otherwise it could not be the immediate offspring and much less the express resemblance of god who is essential holiness it is pure from all sin clean and unspotted from any touch of evil it is a chaste virgin incapable of any defilement of any mixture with that which is unclean or unholy it has no fellowship with sin of any kind for what communion hath light with darkness as sin is in its very nature enmity to god so his law is enmity to sin therefore it is that the apostle rejects with such abhorrence that blasphemous supposition that the law of god is either sin itself or the cause of sin god forbid that we should suppose it is the cause of sin because it is the discoverer of it because it detects the hidden things of darkness and drags them out into open day it is true by this means as the apostle observesrom 713 sin appears to be sin all its disguises are torn away and it appears in its native deformity it is true likewise that sin by the commandment becomes exceeding sinful being now committed against light and knowledge being stripped even of the poor plea of ignorance it loses its excuse as well as disguise and becomes far more odious both to god and man yea and it is true that sinworketh death by that which is good which in itself is pure and holy when it is dragged out to light it rages the more when it is restrained it bursts out with greater violence thus the apostle speaking in the person of one who was convinced of sin but not yet delivered from it sin taking occasion by the commandment detecting and endeavouring to restrain it disdained the restraint and so much the more wrought in me all manner of concupiscence rom 78 all manner of foolish and hurtful desire which that commandment sought to restrain thus when the commandment came sin revivedrom 79 it fretted and raged the more but this is no stain on the commandment though it is abused it cannot be defiled this only proves that the heart of man is desperately wicked but the law of god is holy still and it is secondly just it renders to all their due it prescribes exactly what is right precisely what ought to be done said or thought both with regard to the author of our being with regard to ourselves and with regard to every creature which he has made it is adapted in all respects to the nature of things of the whole universe and every individual it is suited to all the circumstances of each and to all their mutual relations whether such as have existed from he beginning or such as commenced in any following period it is exactly agreeable to thefitnesses of things whether essential or accidental it clashes with none of these in any degree nor is ever unconnected with them if the word be taken in that sense there is nothing arbitrary in the law of god although still the whole and every part thereof is totally dependent upon his will so that thy will be done is the supreme universal law both in earth and heaven but is the will of god the cause of his law is his will the original of right and wrong is a thing therefore right because god wills it or does he will it because it is right i fear this celebrated question is more curious than useful and perhaps in the manner it is usually treated of it does not so well consist with the regard that is due from a creature to the creator and governor of all things it is hardly decent for man to call the supreme god to give an account to him nevertheless with awe and reverence we may speak a little the lord pardon us if we speak amiss it seems then that the whole difficulty arises from considering gods will as distinct from god otherwise it vanishes away for none can doubt but god is the cause of the law of god but the will of god is god himself it is god considered as willing thus or thus consequently to say that the will of god or that god himself is the cause of the law is one and the same thing again if the law the immutable rule of right and wrong depends upon the nature andfitnesses of things and on their essential relations to each other i do not say their eternal relations because the eternal relation of things existing in time is little less than a contradiction if i say this depends on the nature and relations of things then it must depend on god or the will of god because those thing themselves with all their relations are the works of his hands by his will for his pleasure alone they all are and were created   and yet it may be granted which is probably all that a considerate person would contend for that in every particular case god wills this or this suppose that men should honour their parents because it is right agreeable to the fitness of things to the relation wherein they stand the law then is right and just concerning all things and it is good as well as just this we may easily infer from the fountain whence it flowed for what was this but the goodness of god what but goodness alone inclined him to impart that divine copy of himself to the holy angels to what else can we impute his bestowing upon man the same transcript of his own nature and what but tender love constrained him afresh to manifest his will to fallen man  either to adam or any of his seed who like him were come short of the glory of god was it not mere love that moved him to publish his law after the understandings of men were darkened and to send his prophets to declare that law to the blind thoughtless children of men doubtless his goodness it was which raised upenoch and noah to be preachers of righteousness which causedabraham his friend and isaac and jacob to bear witness to his truth it was his goodness alone which when darkness had covered the earth and thick darkness the people gave a written law tomoses and through him to the nation whom he had chosen it was love which explained these living oracles by david and all the prophets that followed until when the fullness of time was come he sent his onlybegotten son not to destroy the law but to fulfil confirm every jot and title thereof till having wrote it in the hearts of all his children and put all his enemies under his feet he shall deliver up hismediatorial kingdom to the father that god may be all in all 1 cor 1528 and this law which the goodness of god gave at first and has preserved through all ages is like the fountain from whence it springs full of goodness and benignity it is mild and kind it is as the psalmist expresses it sweeter than honey and the honeycomb it is winning and amiable it includes whatsoever things are lovely or of good report if there be any virtue if there be any praise before god and his holy angels they are all comprised in this wherein are hid all the treasures of the divine wisdom and knowledge and love and it is good in its effects as well as in its nature as the tree is so are its fruits the fruits of the law of god written in the heart are righteousness and peace and assurance for ever or rather the law itself is righteousness filling the soul with a peace whichpasseth all understanding and causing us to rejoice evermore in the testimony of a good conscience toward god it is to so properly a pledge as an earnest of our inheritance being a part of the purchased possession it is god made manifest in our flesh and bringing with him eternal life assuring us by that pure and perfect love that we are sealed unto the day of redemption that he will spare us as a manspareth his own son that serveth him in that day when he maketh up his jewels and that there remaineth for us a crown of glory which fadeth not away iv 1 it remains only to show in the fourth and last place the uses of the law and the first use of it without question is to convince the world of sin this is indeed the peculiar work of the holy ghost who can work it with out any means at all or by whatever means itpleaseth him however insufficient in themselves or even improper to produce such an effect and accordingly some there are whose hearts have been broken in pieces in a moment either in sickness or in health without any visible cause or any outward means whatever and others one in an age have beenawakened to a sense of the wrath of god abiding on them by hearing that god was in christ reconciling the world unto himself but it is the ordinary method of the spirit of god to convict sinners by the law it is this which being set home on the conscience generallybreaketh the rocks in pieces it is more especially this part of the word of god which is zon kai energes  quick and powerful full of life and energy and sharper than any two edged sword this in the hand of god and of those whom he hath sent pierces through all the folds of a deceitful heart and divides asunder even the soul and the spirit yea as it were the very joints and marrow by this is the sinner discovered to himself all his figleaves are torn away and he sees that he is wretched and poor and miserable and blind and naked the law flashes conviction on every side he feels himself a mere sinner he has nothing to pay his mouth is stopped and he stands guilty before god 2 to slay the sinner is then the first use of the law to destroy the life and strength wherein he trusts and convince him that he is dead while heliveth not only under the sentence of death but actually dead unto god void of all spiritual life dead in trespasses and sins the second use of it is   to bring him unto life unto christ that he may live it is true in performing both these offices it acts the part of a severe schoolmaster it drives us by force rather than draws us by love and yet love is the spring of all it is the spirit of love which by this painful means tears away our confidence in the flesh which leaves us no broken reed whereon to trust and so constrains the sinner stripped of all to cry out in the bitterness of his soul or groan in the depth of his heart i give up every plea beside  lord i am damnd but thou hast died 3 the third use of the law is to keep us alive it is the grand means whereby the blessed spirit prepares the believer for larger communications of the life of god i am afraid this great and important truth is little understood not only by the world but even by many whom god hath taken out of the world who are real children of god by faith many of these lay it down as an unquestioned truth that when we come to christ we have done with the law and that in this sense christ is the end of the law to every one that believeth the end of the law so he is for righteousness for justification to every one that believeth herein the law is at an end it justifies none but only brings them to christ who is also in another respect the end or scope of the law  the point at which it continually aims but when it has brought us to him it has yet a farther office namely to keep us with him for it is continually exciting all believers the more they see of its height and depth and length and breadth to exhort one another so much the more  closer and closer let us cleave to his beloved embrace expect his fullness to receive and grace to answer grace allowing then that every believer has done with the law as it means the jewish ceremonial law or the entire mosaic dispensation for these christ hath taken out of the way yea allowing we have done with the moral law as a means of procuring our justification for we are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in jesus yet in another sense we have not done with this law for it is still of unspeakable use first in convincing us of the sin that yet remains both in our hearts and lives and thereby keeping us close to christ that his blood may cleanse us every moment secondly in deriving strength from our head into his living members whereby he empowers them to do what his law commands and thirdly in confirming our hope of whatsoever it commands and we have not yet attained  of receiving grace upon grace till we are in actual possession of thefulness of his promises  how clearly does this agree with the experience of every true believer while he cries out o what love have i unto thy law all the day long is my study in it he sees daily in that divine mirror more and more of his own sinfulness he sees more and more clearly that he is still a sinner in all things  that neither his heart nor his ways are right before god and that every moment sends him to christ this shows him the meaning of what is written thou shalt make a plate of pure gold and grave upon it holiness to the lord and it shall be upon aarons forehead the type of our great highpriest that aaron may bear the iniquity of the holy things which the children of israel shallhallow in all their holy gifts so far are our prayers or holy things from atoning for the rest of our sin and it shall be always upon his forehead that they may be accepted before the lord exod 2836 38 to explain this by a single instance the law says thou shalt not kill and hereby as our lord teaches forbids not only outward acts but every unkind word or thought now the more i look into this perfect law the more i feel how far i come short of it and the more i feel this the more i feel my need of his blood to atone for all my sin and of his spirit to purify my heart and make me perfect and entire lacking nothing   therefore i cannot spare the law one moment no more than i can spare christ seeing i now want it as much to keep me to christ as i ever wanted it to bring me to him otherwise this evil heart of unbelief would immediately depart from the living god indeed each is continually sending me to the other  the law to christ and christ to the law on the one hand the height and depth of the law constrain me to fly to the love of god in christ on the other the love of god in christ endears the law to me above gold or precious stones seeing i know every part of it is a gracious promise which my lord will fulfil in its season who art thou then o man that judgest the law and speakest evil of the law  that rankest it with sin satan and death and sendest them all to hell together the apostle james esteemed judging or speaking evil of the law so enormous a piece of wickedness that he knew not how to aggravate the guilt of judging our brethren more than by showing it included this so now says he thou art not a doer of the law but a judge a judge of that which god hath ordained to judge thee so thou hast set up thyself in the judgementseat of christ and cast down the rule whereby he will judge the world o take knowledge what advantage satan hath gained over thee and for the time to come never think or speak lightly of much less dress up as a scarecrow this blessed instrument of the grace of god yea love and value it for the sake of him from whom it came and of him to whom it leads let it be thy glory and joy next to the cross of christ declare its praise and make it honourable before all men  and if thou are thoroughly convinced that it is the offspring of god that it is the copy of all his inimitable perfections and that it is holy and just and good but especially to them that believe then instead of casting it away as a polluted thing see that thou cleave to it more and more never let the law of mercy and truth of love to god and man of lowliness meekness and purity forsake thee bind it about thy neck writ it on the table of thy heart keep close to the law if thou wilt keep close to christ hold it fast let it not go let this continually lead thee to the atoning blood continually confirm thy hope till all the righteousness of the law is fulfilled in thee and thou art filled with all the fullness of god  and if thy lord hath already fulfilled his word if he hath already written his law in thy heart then stand fast in the liberty wherewith christ hath made thee free thou art not only made free from jewish ceremonies from the guilt of sin and the fear of hell these are so far from being the whole that they are the least and lowest part of christian liberty but what is infinitely more from the power of sin from serving the devil from offending god o stand fast in this liberty in comparison of which all the rest is not even worthy to be named stand fast in loving god with all thy heart and serving him with all thy strength this is perfect freedom thus to keep his law and to walk in all his commandments blameless be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage i do not mean of jewish bondage nor yet of bondage to the fear of hell these i trust are far from thee but beware of being entangled again with the yoke of sin of any inward or outward transgression of the law abhor sin far more than death or hell abhor sin itself far more than the punishment of it beware of the bondage of pride of desire of anger of every evil temper or word or work look unto jesus and in order thereto look more and more into the perfect law the law of liberty and continue therein so shalt thou daily grow in grace and in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ   sermon 35 the law established through faith text from the 1872 edition discourse i do we then make void the law through faith god forbid yea we establish the law romans 331 st paul having the beginning of this epistle laid down his general proposition namely that the gospel of christ is the power of god unto salvation to every one that believeth  the powerful means whereby god makes every believer a partaker of present and eternal salvation  goes on to show that there is no other way under heaven whereby men can be saved he speaks particularly of salvation from the guilt of sin which he commonly terms justification and that all men stood in need of this that none could plead their own innocence he proves at large by various arguments addressed to the jews as well as the heathens hence he infers in the 19th verse of this chapter that every mouth whether of jew or heathen must be stopped from excusing or justifying himself and all the world become guilty before god therefore saith he by his own obedience by the words of the law shall no flesh be justified in his sight but now the righteousness of god without the law   without our previous obedience thereto  is manifested even the righteousness of god which is by faith of jesus christ unto all and upon all that believe for there is no difference  as to their need of justification or the manner wherein they attain it  for all have sinned and come short of the glory of god  the glorious image of god wherein they were created and all who attain are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in jesus christ whom god hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood that he might be just and yet the justifier of him which believeth in jesus  that without any impeachment to his justice he might show him mercy for the sake of that propitiation therefore we conclude which was the grand position he had undertaken to establish that a man is justified by faith without the works of the law verses 2028 it was easy to foresee an objection which might be made and which has in fact been made in all ages namely that to say we are justified without the works of the law is to abolish the law the apostle without entering into a formal dispute simply denies the charge do we then says he make void the law through faith god forbid yea we establish the law the strange imagination of some that st paul when he says a man is justified without the works of the law means only ceremonial law is abundantly confuted by these very words for did st paul establish the ceremonial law it is evident he did not he did make void that law through faith and openly avowed his doing so it was the moral law only of which he might truly say we do not make void but establish this through faith but all men are not herein of his mind many there are who will not agree to this many in all ages of the church even among those who bore the name of christians have contended that the faith once delivered to the saints was designed to make void the whole law they would no more spare the moral than the ceremonial law but were for hewing as it were both in pieces before the lord vehemently maintaining if you establish any law christ shall profit you nothing christ is become of no effect to you ye are fallen from grace but is the zeal of these men according to knowledge have they observed theconnexion between the law and faith and that considering the close connexion between them to destroy one is indeed to destroy both  that to abolish the moral law is in truth to abolish faith and the law together as leaving no proper means either of bringing us to faith or of stirring up that gift of god in our soul 6 it therefore behoves all who desire either to come to christ or to walk in him whom they have received to take heed how they make void the law through faith to secure us effectually against which let us inquire first which are the most usual ways of making void the law through faith and secondly how we may follow the apostle and by faith establish the law   i 1 let us first inquire which are the most usual ways of making void the law through faith now the way for a preacher to make it all void at a stroke is not to preach it at all this is just the same thing as to blot it out of the oracles of god more especially when it is done with design when it is made a rule not to preach the law and the very phrase a preacher of the law is used as a term of reproach as though it meant little less than an enemy of the gospel all this proceeds from the deepest ignorance of the nature properties and use of the law and proves that those who act thus either know not christ  are utter strangers to living faith  or at least that they are but babes in christ and as such unskilled in the word of righteousness their grand plea is this that preaching the gospel that is according to their judgment the speaking of nothing but the sufferings and merits of christ answers all the ends of the law but this we utterly deny it does not answer the very first end of the law namely the convincing men of sin the awakening those who are still asleep on the brink of hell there may have been here and there an exempt case one in a thousand may have beenawakened by the gospel but this is no general rule the ordinary method of god is to convict sinners by the law and that only the gospel is not the means which god hath ordained or which our lord himself used for this end we have no authority in scripture for applying it thus nor any ground to think it will prove effectual nor have we any more ground to expect this from the nature of the thing they that be whole as our lord himself observes need not a physician but they that are sick it is absurd therefore to offer a physician to them that are whole or that at least imagine themselves so to be you are first to convince them that they are sick otherwise they will not thank you for your labour it is equally absurd to offer christ to them whose heart is whole having never yet been broken it is in the proper sense casting pearls before swine doubtless they will trample them under foot and it is no more than you have reason to expect if they also turn again and rend you but although there is no command in scripture to offer christ to the careless sinner yet are there not scriptural precedents for it i think not i know not any i believe you cannot produce one either from the four evangelists or the acts of the apostles neither can you prove this to have been the practice of any of the apostles from any passage in all their writings nay does not the apostle paul say in his former epistle to the corinthians we preach christ crucified 123 and in his latter we preach not ourselves but christ jesus the lord 45 we consent to rest the cause on this issue to tread in his steps to follow his example only preach you just as paul preached and the dispute is at an end for although we are certain he preached christ in as perfect a manner as the very chief of the apostle yet who preached the law more than st paul therefore he did not think the gospel answered the same end the very first sermon of st pauls which is recorded concludes in these words by him all that believe are justified from all things from which ye could not be justified by the law ofmoses beware therefore lest that come upon you which is spoken of in the prophets behold ye despisers and wonder and perish for i work a work in your days a work which you will in no wise believe though a man declare it unto you acts 1339 40 now it is manifest all this is preaching the law in the sense wherein you understand the term even although great part of if not all his hearers were either jews or religious proselytes verse 43 and therefore probably many of them in some degree at least convicted of sin already he first reminds them that they could not be justified by the law of moses but only by faith in christ and then severely threatens them with the judgments of god which is in the strongest sense preaching the law in his next discourse that to the heathens atlystra 1415ff we do not find so much as the name of christ the whole purport of it is that they should turn from those vain idols unto the living god now confess the truth do not you think if you had been there you could have preached much better than he i should not wonder if you thought too that his preaching so ill occasioned his being so ill treated and that his being stoned was a just judgment upon him for not preaching christ   to the gaoler indeed when he sprang in and came trembling and fell down before paul and silas and said sirs what must i do to be saved he immediately said believe on the lord jesus christ acts 1629 30 and in the case of one so deeply convicted of sin who would not have said the same but to the men of athens you find him speaking in a quite different manner reproving their superstition ignorance and idolatry and strongly moving them to repent from the consideration of a future judgment and of the resurrection from the dead 172431 likewise when felix sent for paul on purpose that he might hear him concerning the faith in christ instead of preaching christ in your sense which would probably have caused the governor either to mock or to contradict and blaspheme he reasoned of righteousness temperance and judgment to come till felix hardened as he was trembled 2424 25 go thou and tread in his steps preach christ to the careless sinner by reasoning of righteousness temperance and judgment to come if you say but he preached christ in a different manner in his epistles i answer 1 he did not there preach at all not in that sense wherein we speak for preaching in our present question means speaking before a congregation but waving this i answer 2 his epistles are directed not to unbelievers such as those we are now speaking of but to the saints of god in romecorinth philippi and other places now unquestionably he would speak more of christ to these than to those who were without god in the world and yet 3 every one of these is full of the law even the epistles to the romans and the galatians in both of which he does what you term preaching the law and that to believers as well as unbelievers from hence it is plain you know not what it is to preach christ in the sense of the apostle for doubtless st paul judged himself to be preaching christ both to felix and atantioch lystra and athens from whose example every thinking man must infer that not only the declaring the love of christ to sinners but also the declaring that he will come from heaven in flaming fire is in the apostles sense preaching christ yea in the full scriptural meaning of the word to preach christ is to preach what he hath revealed either in the old or new testament so that you are really preaching christ when you are saying the wicked shall be turned into hell and all the people that forget god as when you are saying behold the lamb of god whichtaketh away the sin of the world consider this well  that to preach christ is to preach all things that christ hath spoken all his promises all his threatenings and commands all that is written in his book and then you will know how to preach christ without making void the law but does not the greatest blessing attend those discourses wherein we peculiarly preach the merits and suffering of christ probably when we preach to a congregation of mourners or of believers these will be attended with the greatest blessing because such discourses are peculiarly suited to their state at least these will usually convey the most comfort but this is not always the greatest blessing i may sometimes receive a far greater by a discourse that cuts me to the heart and humbles me to the dust neither should i receive that comfort if i were to preach or to hear no discourses but on the sufferings of christ these by constant repetition would lose their force and grow more and more flat and dead till at length they would become a dull round of words without any spirit or life or virtue so that thus to preach christ must in process of time make void the gospel as well as the law ii 1 a second way of making void the law through faith is the teaching that faith supersedes the necessity of holiness this divides itself into a thousand smaller paths and many there are that walk therein indeed there are few that wholly escape it few who are convinced we are saved by faith but are sooner or later more or less drawn aside into this byway 2 all those are drawn into this byway who if it be not settled judgment that faith in christ entirely sets aside the necessity of keeping his law yet suppose either sets aside the necessity of keeping his law yet suppose either 1 that holiness is less necessary now than it was before christ came or 2 that a less degree of it is necessary or 3 that it is less necessary to believers than to others yea and so are all those who although their judgment be right in the general yet think they may take more liberty in particular cases than they could have done before they believed indeed the using the   term liberty in such a manner for liberty from obedience or holiness shows at once that their judgment is perverted and that they are guilty of what they imagined to be far from them namely of making void the law through faith by supposing faith to supersede holiness 3 the first plea of those who teach this expressly is that we are now under the covenant of grace not works and therefore we are no longer under the necessity of performing the works of the law and who ever was under the covenant of works none but adam before the fall he was fully and properly under that covenant which required perfect universal obedience as the one condition of acceptance and left no place for pardon upon the very least transgression but no man else was ever under this neither jew nor gentile neither before christ nor since all his sons were and are under the covenant of grace the manner of their acceptance is this the free grace of god through the merits of christ gives pardon to them that believe that believe with such a faith as working by love produces all obedience and holiness the case is not therefore as you suppose that men were once more obliged to obey god or to work the works of his law than they are now this is a supposition you cannot make good but we should have been obliged if we had been under the covenant of works to have done those works antecedent to our acceptance whereas now all good works though as necessary as ever are not antecedent to our acceptance but consequent upon it therefore the nature of the covenant of grace gives you no ground no encouragement at all to set aside any insistence or degree of obedience any part or measure of holiness but are we not justified by faith without the works of the law undoubtedly we are without the works either of the ceremonial or the moral law and would to god all men were convicted of this it would prevent innumerable evils antinomianism in particular for generally speaking they are the pharisees who make the antinomians running into an extreme so palpably contrary to scripture they occasion others to run into the opposite one these seeking to be justified by works affright those from allowing any place for them but the truth lies between both we are doubtless justified by faith this is the cornerstone of the whole christian building we are justified without the works of the law as any previous condition of justification but they are an immediate fruit of that faith whereby we are justified so that if good works do not follow our faith even all inward and outward holiness it is plain our faith is nothing worth we are yet in our sins therefore that we are justified by faith even by our faith without works is no ground for making void the law through faith or for imagining that faith is a dispensation from any kind or degree of holiness nay but does not st paul expressly say unto him thatworketh not but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly his faith is counted for righteousness and does it not follow from hence that faith is to a believer in the room in the place of righteousness but if faith is in the room of righteousness or holiness what need is there of this too this it must be acknowledged comes home to the point and is indeed the main pillar of antinomianism and yet it needs not a long or laboured answer we allow 1 that god justifies the ungodly him that till that hour is totally ungodly  full of all evil void of all good 2 that he justifies the ungodly that worketh not that till that moment worketh no good work  neither can he for an evil tree cannot bring forth good fruit 3 that he justifies him by faith alone without any goodness or righteousness preceding and 4 that faith is then counted to him for righteousness namely for preceding righteousness that is god through the merits of christ accepts him that believes as if he had already fulfilled all righteousness but what is all this to your point the apostle does not say either here or elsewhere that this faith is counted to him for subsequent righteousness he does teach that there is no righteousness before faith but where does he teach that there is none after it he does assert holiness cannot precede justification but not that it need not follow it st paul therefore gives you no colour for making void the law by teaching that faith supersedes the necessity of holiness   iii 1 there is yet another way of making void the law through faith which is more common than either of the former and that is the doing it practically the making it void in fact though not in principle the living as if faith was designed to excuse us from holiness how earnestly does the apostle guard us against this in those wellknown words what then shall we sin because we are not under the law but under grace god forbidrom 615 a caution which it is needful thoroughly to consider because it is of the last importance the being under the law may here mean 1 the being obliged to observe the ceremonial law 2 the being obliged to conform to the whole mosaic institution 3 the being obliged to keep the whole moral law as the condition of our acceptance with god and 4 the being under the wrath and curse of god under sentence of eternal death under a sense of guilt and condemnation full of horror and slavish fear now although a believer is not without law to god but under the law to christ yet from the moment he believes he is not under the law in any of the preceding senses on the contrary he is under grace under a more benign gracious dispensation as he is no longer under the ceremonial law nor under the mosaic institution as he is not obliged to keep even the moral law as the condition of his acceptance so he is delivered from the wrath and the curse of god from all sense of guilt and condemnation and from all that horror and fear of death and hell whereby he was all his life before subject to bondage and he now performs which while under the law he could not do a willing and universal obedience he obeys not from the motive of slavish fear but on a nobler principle namely the grace of god ruling in his heart and causing all his works to be wrought in love what then shall this evangelical principle of action be less powerful that the legal shall we be less obedient to god from filial love than we were from servile fear it is well if this is not a common case if this practical antinomianism this unobserved way of making void the law through faith has not infected thousands of believers has it not infected you examine yourself honestly and closely do you not do now what you durst not have done when you was under the law or as we commonly call it under conviction for instance you durst not then indulge yourself in food you took just what was needful and that of the cheapest kind do you not allow yourself more latitude now do you not indulge yourself a little more than you did o beware lest you sin because you are not under the law but under grace 5 when you was under conviction you durst not indulge the lust of the eye in any degree you would not do anything great or small merely to gratify your curiosity you regarded only cleanliness and necessity or at most very moderate convenience either in furniture or apparel superfluity and finery of whatever kind as well as fashionable elegance were both a terror and an abomination to you are they so still is your conscience as tender now in these things as it was then do you still follow the same rule both in furniture and apparel trampling all finer all superfluity every thing useless every thing merely ornamental however fashionable underfoot rather have you not resumed what you had once laid aside and what you could not then use without wounding you conscience and have you not learned to say o i am not so scrupulous now i would to god you were then you would not sin thus because you are not under the law but under grace 6 you was once scrupulous too of commending any to their face and still more of suffering any to commend you it was a stab to your heart you could not bear it you sought the honour thatcometh of god only you could not endure such conversation nor any conversation which was not good to the use of edifying all idle talk all trifling discourse you abhorred you hated as well as feared it being deeply sensible of the value of time of every precious fleeting moment in like manner you dreaded and abhorred idle expense valuing your money only less than your time and trembling lest you should be found an unfaithful steward even of the mammon of unrighteousness do you now look upon praise as deadly poison which you can neither give nor receive but at the peril of your soul do you still dread and abhor all conversation which does not tend to the use of edifying   and labour to improve every moment that it may not pass without leaving you better than it found you are not you less careful as to the expense both of money and time cannot you now lay out either as you could not have done once alas how has that which should have been for your health proved to you an occasion of falling how have you sinned because you was not under the law but under grace god forbid you should any longer continue thus to turn the grace of god into lasciviousness o remember how clear and strong a conviction you once had concerning all these things and at the same time you was fully satisfied from whom that conviction came the world told you you was in a delusion but you knew it was the voice of god in these things you was not too scrupulous then but you are not now scrupulous enough god kept you longer in that painful school that you might learn those great lessons the more perfectly and have you forgot them already o recollect them before it is too late have you suffered so many things in vain i trust it is not yet in vain now use the conviction without the pain practice the lesson without the rod let not the mercy of god weigh less with you now than his fiery indignation did before is love a less powerful motive than fear if not let it be an invariable rule i will do nothing now i am under grace which i durst not have done when under the law  i cannot conclude this head without exhorting you to examine yourself likewise touching sins of omission are you as clear of these now you are under grace as you was when under the law how diligent was you then in hearing the word of god did you neglect any opportunity did you not attend thereon day and night would a smallhinderance have kept you away a little business a visitant a slight indisposition a soft bed a dark or cold morning  did not you then fast often or use abstinence to the uttermost of your power was not you much in prayer cold and heavy as you was while you was hanging over the mouth of hell did you not speak and not spare even for and unknown god did you not boldly plead his cause  reprove sinners  and avow the truth before an adulterous generation and are you now a believer in christ have you the faith thatovercometh the world what and are less zealous for your master now than you was when you knew him not less diligent in fasting in prayer in hearing his word in calling sinners to god o repent see and feel your grievous loss remember from whence you are fallen bewail your unfaithfulness now be zealous and do the first works lest if you continue to make void the law through faith god cut you off and appoint you your portion with the unbelievers   sermon 36 text from the 1872 edition the law established through faith discourse 2 do we then make void the law through faith god forbid yea we establish the lawrom 331 it has been shown in the preceding discourse which are the most usual ways of making void the law through faith namely first the not preaching it at all which effectually makes it all void a stroke and this under colour of preaching christ and magnifying the gospel though it be in truth destroying both the one and the other secondly the teaching whether directly or directly that faith supersedes the necessity of holiness that this less necessary now or a less degree of it necessary than before christ came that it is less necessary to us because we believe than otherwise it would have been or that christian liberty is a liberty from any kind or degree of holiness so perverting those great truths that we are now under the covenant of grace and not of works that a man is justified by faith without the works of the law and that to him thatworketh not but believeth his faith is counted for righteousness or thirdly the doing this practically the making void the law in practice though not in principle the living or acting as if faith was designed to excuse us from holiness the allowing ourselves in sin because we are not under the law but under grace it remains to inquire how we may follow a better pattern how we may be able to say with the apostle do we then make void the law through faith god forbid yea we establish the law we do not indeed establish the old ceremonial law we know that is abolished for ever much less do we establish the whole mosaic dispensation this we know our lord has nailed to his cross nor yet do we so establish the moral law which it is to be feared too many do as if the fulfilling it the keeping all the commandments were the condition of our justification if it were so surely in his sight should no man living be justified but all this being allowed we still in the apostles sense establish the law the moral law i 1 we establish the law first by our doctrine by endeavouring to preach it in its whole extent to explain and enforce every part of it in the same manner as our great teacher did while upon earth we establish it by following st peters advice if any man speak let him speak as the oracles of god as the holy men of old moved by the holy ghost spoke and wrote for our instruction and as the apostles of our blessed lord by the direction of the same spirit we establish it whenever we speak in his name by keeping back nothing from them that hear by declaring to them without any limitation or reserve the whole counsel of god and in order the more effectually to establish it we use herein great plainness of speech we are not as many that corrupt the word of god  kapeleuontes as artful men their bad wines we do notcauponize mix adulterate or soften it to make it suit the taste of the hearers  but as of sincerity but as of god in the sight of god speak we in christ as having no other aim than by manifestation of the truth to commend ourselves to every mans conscience in the sight of god we then by our doctrine establish the law when we thus openly declare it to all men and that in the fullness wherein it is delivered by our blessed lord and his apostles when we publish it in the height and depth and length and breadth thereof we then establish the law when we declare every part of it every commandment contained therein not only in its full literal sense but likewise in its spiritual meaning not only with regard to the outward actions which it either forbids or enjoins but also with respect to the inward principle to the thoughts desires and intents of the heart and indeed this we do the more diligently not only because it is of the deepest importance  inasmuch as all the fruit every word and work must be only evil continually if the tree be evil if the dispositions and tempers of the heart be not right before god  but likewise because as important as these things are they are little considered or understood  so little that we may truly say of the law too when taken in its full spiritual meaning it is a mystery which was hid from ages and generations   since the world began it was utterly hid from the heathen world they with all their boasted wisdom neither found out god nor the law of god not in the letter much less in the spirit of it their foolish hearts were more and more darkened while professing themselves wise they became fools and it was almost equally hid as to its spiritual meaning from the bulk of the jewish nation even these who were so ready to declare concerning others this people that know not the law are cursed pronounced their own sentence therein as being under the same curse the same dreadful ignorance witness our lords continual reproof of the wisest among them for their gross misinterpretations of it witness the supposition almost universally received among them that they needed only to make clean the outside of the cup that the paying tithe of mint anise andcummin  outward exactness  would atone for inward unholiness for the total neglect both of justice and mercy of faith and the love of god yea so absolutely was the spiritual meaning of the law hidden from the wisest of them that one of their most eminent rabbis comments thus on those words of the psalmist if i incline unto iniquity with my heart the lord will not hear me that is saith he if it be only in my heart if i do not commit outward wickedness the lord will not regard it he will not punish me unless i proceed to the outward act  but alas the law of god as to its inward spiritual meaning is not hid from the jews or heathens only but even from what is called the christian world at least from a vast majority of them the spiritual sense of the commandments of god is still a mystery to these also nor is this observable only in those lands which are overspread with romish darkness and ignorance but this is too sure that the far greater part even of those who are called reformed christians are utter strangers at this day to the law of christ in the purity and spirituality of it hence it is that to this day the scribes andpharisees the men who have the form but not the power of religion and who are generally wise in their own eyes and righteous in their own conceits   hearing these things are offended are deeply offended when we speak of the religion of the heart and particularly when we show that without this were we to give all our goods to feed the poor it would profit us nothing but offended they must be for we cannot but speak the truth as it is in jesus it is our part whether they will hear or whether they will forbear to deliver our own soul all that is written in the book of god we are to declare not as pleasing men but the lord we are to declare not only all the promises but all the threatenings too which we find therein at the same time that we proclaim all the blessings and privileges which god hath prepared for his children we are likewise to teach all the things whatsoever he hath commanded and we know that all these have their use either for the awakening those that sleep the instructing the ignorant the comforting the feebleminded or the building up and perfecting of the saints we know that all scripture given by inspiration of god is profitable either for doctrine or for reproof either for correction or for instruction in righteousness and that the man of god in the process of the work of god in his soul has need of every part thereof that he may at length be perfectthroughly furnished unto all good works  it is our part thus to preach christ by preaching all things whatsoever he hath revealed we may indeed without blame yea and with a peculiar blessing from god declare the love of our lord jesus christ we may speak in a more especial manner of the lord our righteousness we may expatiate upon the grace of god in christ reconciling the world unto himself we may at proper opportunities dwell upon his praise as bearing the iniquities of us all as wounded for our transgressions and bruised for our iniquities that by his stripes we might be healed  but still we should not preach christ according to his word if we were wholly to confine ourselves to this we are not ourselves clear before god unless we proclaim him in all his offices to preach christ as a workman that needeth not to be ashamed is to preach him not only as our great high priest taken from among men and ordained for men in things pertaining to god as such reconciling us to god by his blood and ever living to make intercession for us  but likewise as the prophet of the lord who of god is made unto us wisdom who by his word and his spirit is with us always guiding us into all truth  yea and as remaining a king for ever as giving laws to all whom he has bought with his blood as restoring those to the image of god whom he had first reinstated in his favour as reigning in all believing hearts until he has subdued all things to himself  until he hath utterly cast out all sin and brought in everlasting righteousness   ii 1 we establish the law secondly when we so preach faith in christ as not to supersede but produce holiness to produce all manner of holiness negative and positive of the heart and of the life in order to this we continually declare what should be frequently and deeply considered by all who would not make void the law through faith that faith itself even christian faith the faith of gods elect the faith of the operation of god still is only the handmaid of love as glorious and honourable as it is it is not the end of the commandment god hath given this honour to love alone love is the end of all the commandments of god love is the end the sole end of every dispensation of god from the beginning of the world to the consummation of all things and it will endure when heaven and earth flee away for love alone neverfaileth faith will totally fail it will be swallowed up in sight in the everlasting vision of god but even then love  its nature and its office still the same lasting its lamp and unconsumed its flame  in deathless triumph shall for ever live and endless good diffuse and endless praise receive very excellent things are spoken of faith and whosoever is a partaker thereof may well say with the apostle thanks be to god for his unspeakable gift yet still it loses all its excellence when brought into a comparison with love what st paul observes concerning the superior glory of the gospel above that of the law may with great propriety be spoken of the superior glory of love above that of faith even that which was made glorious hath no glory in this respect by reason of the glory that excelleth for if that which is done away is glorious much more doth that whichremaineth exceed in glory yea all the glory of faith before it is done away arises hence that it ministers to love it is the great temporary means which god has ordained to promote that eternal end let those who magnify faith beyond all proportion so as to swallow up all things else and who so totally misapprehend the nature of it as to imagine it stands in the place of love consider farther that as love will exist after faith so it did exist long before it the angels who from the moment of their creation beheld the face of their father that is in heaven had no occasion for faith in its general notion as it is the evidence of things not seen neither had they need of faith in its more particular acceptation faith in the blood of jesus for he took not upon him the nature of angels but only the seed of abraham there was therefore no place before the foundation of the world for faith either in the general or particular sense but there was for love love existed from eternity in god the great ocean of love love had a place in all the children of god from the moment of their creation they received at once from their gracious creator to exist and to love nor is it certain as ingeniously and plausibly as many have descanted upon this that faith even in the general sense of the word had any place in paradise it is highly probable from that short and uncircumstantial account which we have in holy writ that adam before he rebelled against god walked with him by sight and not by faith for then his reasons eye was strong and clear and as an eagle can behold the sun might have beheld his makers face as near as the intellectual angels could have done he was then able to talk with him face to face whose face we cannot now see and live and consequently had no need of that faith whose office it is to supply the want of sight 5 on the other hand it is absolutely certain faith in its particular sense had then no place for in that sense it necessarily presupposes sin and the wrath of god declared against the sinner without   which there is no need of an atonement for sin in order to the sinners reconciliation with god consequently as there was no need of an atonement before the fall so there was no place for faith in that atonement man being then pure from every stain of sin holy as god is holy but love even then filled his heart it reigned in him without rival and it was only when love was lost by sin that faith was added not for its own sake nor with any design that it should exist any longer than until it had answered the end for which it was ordained  namely to restore man to the love from which he was fallen at the fall therefore was added this evidence of things unseen which before was utterly needless this confidence in redeeming love which could not possibly have any place till the promise was made that the seed of the woman should bruise the serpents head 6 faith then was originally designed of god to reestablish the law of love therefore in speaking thus we are not undervaluing it or robbing it of its due praise but on the contrary showing its real worth exalting it in its just proportion and giving it that very place which the wisdom of god assigned it from the beginning it is the grand means of restoring that holy love wherein man was originally created it follows that although faith is of no value in itself as neither is any other means whatsoever yet as it leads to that end the establishing anew the law of love in our hearts and as in the present state of things it is the only means under heaven for effecting it it is on that account an unspeakable blessing to man and of unspeakable value before god iii 1 and this naturally brings us to observe thirdly the most important way of establishing the law namely the establishing it in our own hearts and lives indeed without this what would all the rest avail we might establish it by our doctrine we might preach it in its whole extent might explain and enforce every part of it we might open it in its most spiritual meaning and declare the mysteries of the kingdom we might preach christ in all his offices and faith in christ as opening all the treasures of his love and yet all this time if the law we preached were not established in our hearts we should be of no more account before god than sounding brass or tinkling cymbals all our preaching would be so far from profiting ourselves that it would only increase our damnation 2 this is therefore the main point to be considered how may we establish the law in our own hearts so that it may have its full influence on our lives and this can only be done by faith faith alone it is which effectually answers this end as we learn from daily experience for so long as we walk by faith not by sight we go swiftly on in the way of holiness while we steadily look not at the things which are seen but at those which are not seen we are more and more crucified to the world and the world crucified to us let but the eye of the soul be constantly fixed not on the things which are temporal but on those which are eternal and our affections are more and more loosened from earth and fixed on things above so that faith in general is the most direct and effectual means of promoting all righteousness and true holiness of establishing the holy and spiritual law in the hearts of them that believe and by faith taken in its more particular meaning for a confidence in a pardoning god we establish his law in our own hearts in a still more effectual manner for there is no motive which so powerfully inclines us to love god as the sense of the love of god in christ nothing enables us like a piercing conviction of this to give our hearts to him who was given for us and from this principle of grateful love to god arises love to our brother also neither can we avoid loving our neighbour if we truly believe the love wherewith god hath loved us now this love to man grounded on faith and love to god worketh no ill to our neighbour consequently it is as the apostle observesthe fulfilling of the whole negative law for this thou shalt not commit adultery thou shalt not kill thou shalt not steal thou shalt not bear false witness thou shalt not covet and if there be any other commandment it is briefly comprehended in this saying thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself neither is love content with barely working no evil to our neighbour it continually incites us to do good as we have time and opportunity to do good in every possible kind and in every possible degree to all men it is therefore the fulfilling of the positive likewise as well as of the negative law of god  nor does faith fulfil either the negative or positive law as to the external part only but it works inwardly by love to the purifying of the heart the cleansing it from all vile affections everyone that hath this faith in himself purifieth himself even as he is pure  purifieth himself from every   earthly sensual desire from all vile and inordinate affections yea from the whole of that carnal mind which is enmity against god at the same time if it have its perfect work it fills him with all goodness righteousness and truth it brings all heaven into his soul and causes him to walk in the light even as god is in the light 5 let us thus endeavour to establish the law in ourselves not sinning because we are under grace but rather using all the power we receive thereby to fulfil all righteousness calling to mind what light we received from god while his spirit was convincing us of sin let us beware we do not put out that light what we had then attained let us hold fast let nothing induce us to build again what we have destroyed to resume anything small or great which we then clearly saw was not for the glory of god or the profit of our own soul or to neglect anything small or great which we could not then neglect without a check from our own conscience to increase and perfect the light which we had before let us now add the light of faith confirm we the former gift of god by a deeper sense of whatever he had then shown us by a greater tenderness of conscience and a more exquisite sensibility of sin walking now with joy and not with fear in a clear steady sight of things eternal we shall look on pleasure wealth praiseall the things of earth as on bubbles upon the water counting nothing important nothing desirable nothing worth a deliberate thought but only what is within the veil where jesus sitteth at the right hand of god  can you say thou art merciful to my unrighteousness my sins thou rememberest no more then for the time to come see that you fly from sin as from the face of a serpent for how exceeding sinful does it appear to you now how heinous above all expression on the other hand in how amiable a light do you now see the holy and perfect will of god now therefore labour that it may be fulfilled both in you by you and upon you now watch and pray that you may sin no more that you may see and shun the least transgression of his law you see the motes which you could not see before when the sun shines into a dark place in like manner you see the sins which you could not see before now the sun of righteousness shines in your heart now then do all diligence to walk in every respect according to the light you have received now be zealous to receive more light daily more of the knowledge and love of god more of the spirit of christ more of his life and of the power of his resurrection now use all the knowledge and love and life and power you have already attained so shall you continually go on from faith to faith so shall you daily increase in holy love till faith is swallowed up in sight and the law of love established to all eternity   sermon 37 text from the 1872 edition the nature of enthusiasm and festus said with a loud voice paul thou art beside thyself acts 2624 and so say all the world the men who know not god of all that are of pauls religion of every one who is so a follower of him as he was of christ it is true there is a sort of religion nay and it is called christianity too which may be practised without any such imputation which is generally allowed to be consistent with common sense that is a religion of form a round of outward duties performed in a decent regular manner you may add orthodoxy thereto a system of right opinions yea and some quantity of heathen morality and yet not many will pronounce that much religion hath made you mad but if you aim at the religion of the heart if you talk of righteousness and peace and joy in the holy ghost then it will not be long before your sentence is passed thou art beside thyself  and it is no compliment which the men of the world pay you here they for once mean what they say they not only affirm but cordially believe that every man is beside himself who says the love of god is shed abroad in his heart by the holy ghost given unto him and that god has enabled him to rejoice in christ with joy unspeakable and full of glory if a man is indeed alive to god and dead to all things here below if he continually sees him that is invisible and accordingly walks by faith and not by sight then they account it a clear case beyond all dispute much religion hath made him mad  it is easy to observe that the determinate thing which the world account madness is that utter contempt of all temporal things and steady pursuit of things eternal that divine conviction of things not seen that rejoicing in the favour of god that happy holy love of god and that testimony of his spirit with our spirit that we are the children of god that is in truth the whole spirit and life and power of the religion of jesus christ they will however allow in other respects the man acts and talks like one in his senses in other things he is a reasonable man it is in these instances only his head is touched it is therefore acknowledged that the madness under which he labours is of a particular kind and accordingly they are accustomed to distinguish it by a particular name enthusiasm a term this which is exceeding frequently used which is scarce ever out of some mens mouths and yet it is exceeding rarely understood even by those who use it most it may be therefore not unacceptable to serious men to all who desire to understand what they speak or hear if i endeavour to explain the meaning of this term  to show what enthusiasm is it may be an encouragement to those who are unjustly charged therewith and may possibly be of use to some who are justly charged with it at least to others who might be so were they not cautioned against it as to the word itself it is generally allowed to be of greek extraction but whence the greek word enthousiasmos is derived none has yet been able to show some have endeavoured to derive it from en theoi  in god because all enthusiasm has reference to him but this is quite forced there being small resemblance between the word derived and those they strive to derive it from others would derive it from en thysiai  in sacrifice because many of the enthusiasts of old were affected in the most violent manner during the time of sacrifice perhaps it is a fictitious word invented from the noise which some of those made who were so affected it is not improbable that one reason why this uncouth word has been retained in so many languages was because men were not better agreed concerning the meaning than concerning the derivation of it they therefore adopted the greek word because they did not understand it they did not translate it into their own tongues because they knew not how to translate it it having been always a word of a loose uncertain sense to which no determinate meaning was affixed   it is not therefore at all surprising that it is so variously taken at this day different persons understanding it in different senses quite inconsistent with each other some take it in a good sense for a divine impulse or impression superior to all the natural faculties and suspending for the time either in whole or in part both the reason and the outward senses in this meaning of the word both the prophets of old and the apostles were proper enthusiasts being at divers times so filled with the spirit and so influenced by him who dwelt in their hearts that the exercise of their own reason their senses and all their natural faculties being suspended they were wholly actuated by the power of god and spake only as they were moved by the holy ghost others take the word in an indifferent sense such as is neither morally good nor evil thus they speak of the enthusiasm of the poets of homer and virgil in particular and this a late eminent writer extends so far as to assert there is no man excellent in his profession whatsoever it be who has not in his temper a strong tincture of enthusiasm by enthusiasm these appear to understand all uncommon vigour of thought a peculiar fervour of spirit a vivacity and strength not to be found in common men elevating the soul to greater and higher things than cool reason could have attained but neither of these is the sense wherein the word enthusiasm is most usually understood the generality of men if no farther agreed at least agree thus far concerning it that it is something evil and this is plainly the sentiment of all those who call the religion of the heart enthusiasm accordingly i shall take it in the following pages as an evil a misfortune if not a fault as to the nature of enthusiasm it is undoubtedly a disorder of the mind and such a disorder as greatly hinders the exercise of reason nay sometimes it wholly sets it aside it not only dims but shuts the eyes of the understanding it may therefore well be accounted a species of madness of madness rather than of folly seeing a fool is properly one who draws wrong conclusions from right premisses whereas a madman draws right conclusions but from wrong premisses and so does an enthusiast suppose his premisses true and his conclusions would necessarily follow but here lies his mistake his premisses are false he imagines himself to be what he is not and therefore setting out wrong the farther he goes the more he wanders out of the way every enthusiast then is properly a madman yet his is not an ordinary but a religious madness by religious i do not mean that it is any part of religion quite the reverse religion is the spirit of a sound mind and consequently stands in direct opposition to madness of every kind but i mean it has religion for its object it is conversant about religion and so the enthusiast is generally talking of religion of god or of the things of god but talking in such a manner that every reasonable christian may discern the disorder of his mind enthusiasm in general may then be described in some such manner as this a religious madness arising from some falsely imagined influence or inspiration of god at least from imputing something to god which ought not to be imputed to him or expecting something from god which ought not to be expected from him there are innumerable sorts of enthusiasm those which are most common and for that reason most dangerous i shall endeavour to reduce under a few general heads that they may be more easily understood and avoided the first sort of enthusiasm which i shall mention is that of those who imagine they have the grace which they have not thus some imagine when it is not so that they have redemption through christ even the forgiveness of sins these are usually such as have no root in themselves no deep repentance or thorough conviction therefore they receive the word with joy and because they have no deepness of earth no deep work in their heart therefore the seed immediately springs up there is immediately a superficial change which together with that light joy striking in with the pride of their unbroken heart and with their inordinate selflove easily persuades them they have already tasted the good word of god and the powers of the world to come 14 this is properly an instance of the first sort of enthusiasm it is a kind of madness arising from the imagination that they have that grace which in truth they have not so that they only deceive their own souls madness it may be justly termed for the reasonings of these poor men are right were their premisses good but as those are a mere creature of their own imagination so all that is built on   them falls to the ground the foundation of all their reveries is this they imagine themselves to have faith in christ if they had this they would be kings and priests to god possessed of a kingdom which cannot be moved but they have it not consequently all their following behaviour is as wide of truth and soberness as that of the ordinary madman who fancying himself an earthly king speaks and acts in that character there are many other enthusiasts of this sort such for instance is the fiery zealot for religion or more properly for the opinions and modes of worship which he dignifies with that name this man also strongly imagines himself to be a believer in jesus yea that he is a champion for the faith which was once delivered to the saints accordingly all his conduct is formed upon that vain imagination and allowing his supposition to be just he would have some tolerable plea for his behaviour whereas now it is evidently the effect of a distempered brain as well as of a distempered heart but the most common of all the enthusiasts of this kind are those who imagine themselves christians and are not these abound not only in all parts of our land but in most parts of the habitable earth that they are not christians is clear and undeniable if we believe the oracles of god for christians are holy these are unholy christians love god these love the world christians are humble these are proud christians are gentle these are passionate christians have the mind which was in christ these are at the utmost distance from it consequently they are no more christians than they are archangels yet they imagine themselves so to be and they can give several reasons for it for they have been called so ever since they can remember they were christened many years ago they embrace the christian opinions vulgarly termed the christian or catholic faith they use the christian modes of worship as their fathers did before them they live what is called a good christian life as the rest of their neighbours do and who shall presume to think or say that these men are not christians  though without one grain of true faith in christ or of real inward holiness without ever having tasted the love of god or been made partakers of the holy ghost ah poor selfdeceivers christians ye are not but you are enthusiasts in a high degree physicians heal yourselves but first know your disease your whole life is enthusiasm as being all suitable to the imagination that you have received that grace of god which you have not in consequence of this grand mistake you blunder on day by day speaking and acting under a character which does in no wise belong to you hence arises that palpable glaring inconsistency that runs through your whole behaviour which is an awkward mixture of real heathenism and imaginary christianity yet still as you have so vast a majority on your side you will always carry it by mere dint of numbers that you are the only men in your senses and all are lunatics who are not as you are but this alters not the nature of things in the sight of god and his holy angels yea and all the children of god upon earth you are mere madmen mere enthusiasts all are you not are you not walking in a vain shadow a shadow of religion a shadow of happiness are you not still disquieting yourselves in vain with misfortunes as imaginary as your happiness or religion do you not fancy yourselves great or good  very knowing and very wise how long perhaps till death brings you back to your senses to bewail your folly for ever and ever  a second sort of enthusiasm is that of those who imagine they have such gifts from god as they have not thus some have imagined themselves to be endued with a power of working miracles of healing the sick by a word or a touch of restoring sight to the blind yea even of raising the dead  a notorious instance of which is still fresh un our own history others have undertaken to prophesy to foretell things to come and that with the utmost certainty and exactness but a little time usually convinces these enthusiasts when plain facts run counter to their predictions experience performs what reason could not and sinks them down into their senses to the same class belong those who in preaching or prayer imagine themselves to be so influenced by the spirit of god as in fact they are not i am sensible indeed that without him we can do nothing more especially in our public ministry that all our preaching is utterly vain unless it be attended with his power and all our prayer unless his spirit therein help our infirmities i know if we do not both preach and pray by the spirit it is all but lost labour seeing the help that is done upon earth he doeth it himself who worketh all in all but this does not affect the case before us though there is a real influence of the spirit of god there is also an imaginary one and many there are who mistake the one for the other many suppose themselves to be under that influence when they   are not when it is far from them and many others suppose they are more under that influence than they really are of this number i fear are all they who imagine that god dictates the very words they speak and that consequently it is impossible they should speak anything amiss either as to the matter or manner of it it is well known how many enthusiasts of this sort also have appeared during the present century some of whom speak in a far more authoritative manner than either st paul or any of the apostles the same sort of enthusiasm though in a lower degree is frequently found in men of a private character they may likewise imagine themselves to be influenced or directed by the spirit when they are not i allow if any man have not the spirit of christ he is none of his and that if ever we either think speak or act aright it is through the assistance of that blessed spirit but how many impute things to him or expect things from him without any rational or scriptural ground such are they who imagine they either do or shall receive particular directions from god not only in points of importance but in things of no moment in the most trifling circumstances of life whereas in these cases god has given us our own reason for a guide though never excluding the secret assistance of his spirit  to this kind of enthusiasm they are peculiarly exposed who expect to be directed of god either in spiritual things or in common life in what is justly called an extraordinary manner i mean by visions or dreams by strong impressions or sudden impulses on the mind i do not deny that god has of old times manifested his will in this manner or that he can do so now nay i believe he does in some very rare instances but how frequently do men mistake herein how are they misled by pride and a warm imagination to ascribe such impulses or impressions dreams or visions to god as are utterly unworthy of him now this is all pure enthusiasm all as wide of religion as it is of truth and soberness  perhaps some may ask ought we not then to inquire what is the will of god in all things and ought not his will to be the rule of our practice unquestionably it ought but how is a sober christian to make this inquiry to know what is the will of god not by waiting for supernatural dreams not by expecting god to reveal it in visions not by looking for any particular impressions or sudden impulses on his mind no but by consulting the oracles of god to the law and to the testimony this is the general method of knowing what is the holy and acceptable will of god but how shall i know what is the will of god in such and such a particular case the thing proposed is in itself of an indifferent nature and so left undetermined in scripture i answer the scripture itself gives you a general rule applicable to all particular cases the will of god is our sanctification it is his will that we should be inwardly and outwardly holy that we should be good and do good in every kind and in the highest degree whereof we are capable thus far we tread upon firm ground this is as clear as the shining of the sun in order therefore to know what is the will of god in a particular case we have only to apply this general rule suppose for instance it were proposed to a reasonable man to marry or to enter into a new business in order to know whether this is the will of god being assured it is the will of god concerning me that i should be as holy and do as much good as i can he has only to enquire in which of these states can i be most holy and do the most good and this is to be determined partly by reason and partly by experience experience tells him what advantages he has in his present state either for being or doing good and reason is to show what he certainly or probably will have in the state proposed by comparing these he is to judge which of the two may most conduce to his being and doing good and as far as he knows this so far he is certain what is the will of god meantime the assistance of his spirit is supposed during the whole process of the inquiry indeed it is not easy to say in how many ways that assistance is conveyed he may bring many circumstances to our remembrance may place others in a stronger and clearer light may insensibly open our mind to receive conviction and fix that conviction upon our heart and to a concurrence of many circumstances of this kind in favour of what is acceptable in his sight he may superadd such an unutterable peace of mind and so uncommon a measure of his love as will leave us no possibility of doubting that this even this is his will concerning us   this is the plain scriptural rational way to know what is the will of god in a particular case but considering how seldom this way is taken and what a flood of enthusiasm must needs break in on those who endeavour to know the will of god by unscriptural irrational ways it were to be wished that the expression itself were far more sparingly used the using it as some do on the most trivial occasions is a plain breach of the third commandment it is a gross way of taking the name of god in vain and betrays great irreverence toward him would it not be far better then to use other expressions which are not liable to such objections for example instead of saying on any particular occasion i want to know what is the will of god would it not be better to say i want to know what will be most for my improvement and what will make me most useful this way of speaking is clear and unexceptionable it is putting the matter on a plain scriptural issue and that without any danger of enthusiasm  a third very common sort of enthusiasm if it does not coincide with the former is that of those who think to attain the end without using the means by the immediate power of god if indeed those means were providentially withheld they would not fall under this charge god can and sometimes does in cases of this nature exert his own immediate power but they who expect this when they have those means and will not use them are proper enthusiasts such are they who expect to understand the holy scriptures without reading them and meditating thereon yea without using all such helps as are in their power and may probably conduce to that end such are they who designedly speak in the public assembly without any premeditation i say designedly because there may be such circumstances as at some times make it unavoidable but whoever despises that great means of speaking profitably is so far an enthusiast it may be expected that i should mention what some have accounted a fourth sort of enthusiasm namely the imagining those things to be owing to the providence of god which are not owing thereto but i doubt i know not what things they are which are not owing to the providence of god in ordering or at least in governing of which this is not either directly or remotely concerned i except nothing but sin and even in the sins of others i see the providence of god to me i do not say his general providence for this i take to be a sounding word which means just nothing and if there be a particular providence it must extend to all persons and all things so our lord understood it or he could never have said even the hairs of your head are all numbered and not a sparrow falleth to the ground without the will of your father which is in heaven but if it be so if god preside universis tanquam singulis et singulis tanquam universis over the whole universe as over every single person and over every single person as over the whole universe what is it except only our own sins which we are not to ascribe to the providence of god so that i cannot apprehend there is any room here for the charge of enthusiasm if it be said the charge lies here when you impute this to providence you imagine yourself the peculiar favourite of heaven i answer you have forgot some of the last words i spoke praesidet universis tanquam singulis his providence is over all men in the universe as much as over any single person do you not see that he who believing this imputes anything which befalls him to providence does not therein make himself any more the favourite of heaven than he supposes every man under heaven to be therefore you have no pretence upon this ground to charge him with enthusiasm against every sort of this it behoves us to guard with the utmost diligence considering the dreadful effects it has so often produced and which indeed naturally result from it its immediate offspring is pride it continually increases this source from whence it flows and hereby it alienates us more and more from the favour and from the life of god it dries up the very springs of faith and love of righteousness and true holiness seeing all these flow from grace but god resisteth the proud and giveth grace only to the humble together with pride there will naturally arise an unadvisable and unconvincible spirit so that into whatever error or fault the enthusiast falls there is small hope of his recovery for reason will have little weight with him as has been frequently and justly observed who imagines he is led by a higher guide  by the immediate wisdom of god and as he grows in pride so he must grow in unadvisableness and in stubbornness also he must be less and less capable of being convinced less   susceptible of persuasion more and more attached to his own judgement and his own will till he is altogether fixed and immovable 32 being thus fortified both against the grace of god and against all advice and help from man he is wholly left to the guidance of his own heart and of the king of the children of pride no marvel then that he is daily more rooted and grounded in contempt of all mankind in furious anger in every unkind disposition in every earthly and devilish temper neither can we wonder at the terrible outward effects which have flowed from such dispositions in all ages even all manner of wickedness all the works of darkness committed by those who call themselves christians while they wrought with greediness such things as were hardly named even among the heathens such is the nature such the dreadful effects of that manyheaded monster enthusiasm from the consideration of which we may now draw some plain inferences with regard to our own practice and first if enthusiasm be a term though so frequently used yet so rarely understood take you care not to talk of you know not what not to use the word till you understand it as in all other points so likewise in this learn to think before you speak first know the meaning of this hard word and then use it if need require but if so few even among men of education and learning much more among the common sort of men understand this dark ambiguous word or have any fixed notion of what it means then secondly beware of judging or calling any man an enthusiast upon common report this is by no means a sufficient ground for giving any name of reproach to any man least of all is it a sufficient ground for so black a term of reproach as this the more evil it contains the more cautious you should be how you apply it to any one to bring so heavy an accusation without full proof being neither consistent with justice nor mercy but if enthusiasm be so great an evil beware you are not entangled therewith yourself watch and pray that you fall not into the temptation it easily besets those who fear or love god o beware you do not think of yourself more highly than you ought to think do not imagine you have attained that grace of god which you have not attained you may have much joy you may have a measure of love and yet not have living faith cry unto god that he would not suffer you blind as you are to go out of the way that you may never fancy yourself a believer in christ till christ is revealed in you and till his spirit witnesses with your spirit that you are a child of god beware you are not a fiery persecuting enthusiast do not imagine that god has called you just contrary to the spirit of him you style your master to destroy mens lives and not to save them never dream of forcing men into the ways of god think yourself and let think use no constraint in matters of religion even those who are farthest out of the way never compel to come in by any other means than reason truth and love beware you do not run with the common herd of enthusiasts fancying you are a christian when you are not presume not to assume that venerable name unless you have a clear scriptural title thereto unless you have the mind which was in christ and walk as he also walked beware you do not fall into the second sort of enthusiasm  fancying you have those gifts from god which you have not trust not in visions or dreams in sudden impressions or strong impulses of any kind remember it is not by these you are to know what is the will of god on any particular occasion but by applying the plain scripture rule with the help of experience and reason and the ordinary assistance of the spirit of god do not lightly take the name of god in your mouth do not talk of the will of god on every trifling occasion but let your words as well as your actions be all tempered with reverence and godly fear beware lastly of imagining you shall obtain the end without using the means conducive to it god can give the end without any means at all but you have no reason to think he will therefore constantly and carefully use all those means which he has appointed to be the ordinary channels of his grace use every means which either reason or scripture recommends as conducive through the free love of god in christ either to the obtaining or increasing any of the gifts of god thus expect a   daily growth in that pure and holy religion which the world always did and always will call enthusiasm but which to all who are saved from real enthusiasm from merely nominal christianity is the wisdom of god and the power of god the glorious image of the most high righteousness and peace a fountain of living water springing up into everlasting life   sermon 38 text from the 1872 edition  sugdens number 33 a caution against bigotry and john answered him saying master we saw one casting out devils in thy name and he followeth not us and we forbad him because he followeth not us but jesus said forbid him not mark 938 39 in the preceding verses we read that after the twelve had been disputing which of them should be the greatest jesus took a little child and set him in the midst of them and taking him in his arms said unto them whosoever shall receive one of these little children in my name receiveth me and whosoever receiveth me receiveth not me only but him that sent me then john answered that is said with reference to what our lord had spoken just before master we saw one casting out devils in thy name and we forbad him because he followeth not us as if he had said ought we to have received him in receiving him should we have received thee ought we not rather to have forbidden him did not we do well therein but jesus said forbid him not the same passage is recited by st luke and almost in the same words but it may be asked what is this to us seeing no man now casts out devils has not the power of doing this been withdrawn from the church for twelve or fourteen hundred years how then are we concerned in the case here proposed or in our lords decision of it perhaps more nearly than is commonly imagined the case proposed being no uncommon case that we may reap our full advantage from it i design to show first in what sense men may and do now cast out devils secondly what we may understand by he followeth not us i shall thirdly explain our lords direction forbid him not and conclude with an inference from the whole i 1 i am in the first place to show in what sense men may and do now cast out devils in order to have the clearest view of this we should remember that according to the scriptural account as god dwells and works in the children of light so the devil dwells and works in the children of darkness as the holy spirit possesses the souls of good men so the evil spirit possesses the souls of the wicked hence it is that the apostle terms him the god of this world from the uncontrolled power he has over worldly men hence our blessed lord styles him the prince of this world so absolute is his dominion over it and hence st john we know that we are of god and all who are not of god the whole world en toi poneroi keitai not lieth in wickedness but lieth in the wicked one lives and moves in him as they who are not of the world do in god for the devil is not to be considered only as a roaring lion going about seeking whom he may devour nor barely as a subtle enemy who cometh unawares upon poor souls and leads them captive at his will but as he who dwelleth in them and walketh in them who ruleth the darkness or wickedness of this world of worldly men and all their dark designs and actions by keeping possession of their hearts setting up his throne there and bringing every thought into obedience to himself thus the strong one armed keepeth his house and if this unclean spirit sometimes go out of a man yet he often returns with seven spirits worse than himself and they enter in and dwell there nor can he be idle in his dwelling he is continually working in these children of disobedience he works in them with power with mighty energy transforming them into his own likeness effacing all the remains of the image of god and preparing them for every evil word and work  it is therefore an unquestionable truth that the god and prince of this world still possesses all who know not god only the manner wherein he possesses them now differs from that wherein he did it of old time then he frequently tormented their bodies as well as souls and that openly without any disguise now he torments their souls only unless in some rare cases and that as covertly as possible the reason of this difference is plain it was then his aim to drive mankind into superstition   therefore he wrought as openly as he could but it is his aim to drive us into infidelity therefore he works as privately as he can for the more secret he is the more he prevails yet if we may credit historians there are countries even now where he works as openly as aforetime but why in savage and barbarous countries only why not in italy france or england for a very plain reason he knows his men and he knows what he hath to do with each to laplanders he appears barefaced because he is to fix them in superstition and gross idolatry but with you he is pursuing a different point he is to make you idolize yourselves to make you wiser in your own eyes than god himself than all the oracles of god now in order to do this he must not appear in his own shape that would frustrate his design no he uses all his art to make you deny his being till he has you safe in his own place he reigns therefore although in a different way yet as absolute in one land as in the other he has the gay italian infidel in his teeth as sure as the wild tartar but he is fast asleep in the mouth of the lion who is too wise to wake him out of sleep so he only plays with him for the present and when he pleases swallows him up the god of this world holds his english worshippers full as fast as those in lapland but it is not his business to affright them lest they should fly to the god of heaven the prince of darkness therefore does not appear while he rules over these his willing subjects the conqueror holds his captives so much the safer because they imagine themselves at liberty thus the strong one armed keepeth his house and his goods are in peace neither the deist nor nominal christian suspects he is there so he and they are perfectly at peace with each other all this while he works with energy in them he blinds the eyes of their understanding so that the light of the glorious gospel of christ cannot shine upon them he chains their souls down to earth and hell with the chains of their own vile affections he binds them down to the earth by love of the world love of money of pleasure of praise and by pride envy anger hate revenge he causes their souls to draw nigh unto hell acting the more secure and uncontrolled because they know not that he acts at all  but how easily may we know the cause from its effects these are sometimes gross and palpable so they were in the most refined of the heathen nations go no farther than the admired the virtuous romans and you will find these when at the height of their learning and glory filled with all unrighteousness fornication wickedness covetousness maliciousness full of envy murder debate deceit malignity whisperers backbiters despiteful proud boasters disobedient to parents covenantbreakers without natural affection implacable unmerciful the strongest parts of this description are confirmed by one whom some may think a more unexceptionable witness i mean their brother heathen dion cassius who observes that before caesars return from gaul not only gluttony and lewdness of every kind were open and barefaced not only falsehood injustice and unmercifulness abounded in public courts as well as private families but the most outrageous robberies rapine and murders were so frequent in all parts of rome that few men went out of doors without making their wills as not knowing if they should return alive as gross and palpable are the works of the devil among many if not all the modern heathens the natural religion of the creeks cherokees chickasaws and all other indians bordering on our southern settlements not of a few single men but of entire nations is to torture all their prisoners from morning till night till at length they roast them to death and upon the slightest undesigned provocation to come behind and shoot any of their own countrymen yea it is a common thing among them for the son if he thinks his father lives too long to knock out his brains and for mother if she is tired of her children to fasten stones about their necks and throw three or four of them into the river one after another  it were to be wished that none but heathens had practised such gross palpable works of the devil but we dare not say so even in cruelty and bloodshed how little have the christians come behind them and not the spaniards or portuguese alone butchering thousands in south america not the dutch only in the east indies or the french in north america following the spaniards step by step   our own countrymen too have wantoned in blood and exterminated whole nations plainly proving thereby what spirit it is that dwells and works in the children of disobedience these monsters might almost make us overlook the works of the devil that are wrought in our own country but alas we cannot open our eyes even here without seeing them on every side is it a small proof of his power that common swearers drunkards whoremongers adulterers thieves robbers sodomites murderers are still found in every part of our land how triumphant does the prince of this world reign in all these children of disobedience he less openly but no less effectually works in dissemblers talebearers liars slanderers in oppressors and extortioners in the perjured the seller of his friend his honour his conscience his country and yet these may talk of religion or conscience still of honour virtue and public spirit but they can no more deceive satan than they can god he likewise knows those that are his and a great multitude they are out of every nation and people of whom he has full possession at this day if you consider this you cannot but see in what sense men may now also cast out devils yea and every minister of christ does cast them out if his lords work prosper in his hand by the power of god attending his word he brings these sinners to repentance an entire inward as well as outward change from all evil to all good and this is in a sound sense to cast out devils out of the souls wherein they had hitherto dwelt the strong one can no longer keep his house a stronger than he is come upon him and hath cast him out and taken possession for himself and made it an habitation of god through his spirit here then the energy of satan ends and the son of god destroys the works of the devil the understanding of the sinner is now enlightened and his heart sweetly drawn to god his desires are refined his affections purified and being filled with the holy ghost he grows in grace till he is not only holy in heart but in all manner of conversation 14 all this is indeed the work of god it is god alone who can cast out satan but he is generally pleased to do this by man as an instrument in his hand who is then said to cast out devils in his name by his power and authority and he sends whom he will send upon this great work but usually such as man would never have thought of for his ways are not as our ways neither his thoughts as our thoughts accordingly he chooses the weak to confound the mighty the foolish to confound the wise for this plain reason that he may secure the glory to himself that no flesh may glory in his sight  ii 1 but shall we not forbid one who thus casteth out devils if he followeth not us this it seems was both the judgement and practice of the apostle till he referred the case to his master we forbad him saith he because he followeth not us which he supposed to be a very sufficient reason what we may understand by this expression he followeth not us is the next point to be considered the lowest circumstance we can understand thereby is he has no outward connexion with us we do not labour in conjunction with each other he is not our fellowhelper in the gospel and indeed whensoever our lord is pleased to send many labourers into his harvest they cannot all act in subordination to or connexion with each other nay they cannot be personal acquaintance with nor be so much as known to one another many there will necessarily be in different parts of the harvest so far from having any mutual intercourse that they will be as absolute strangers to each other as if they had lived in different ages and concerning any of these whom we know not we may doubtless say he followeth not us 2 a second meaning of this expression may be he is not of our party it has long been matter of melancholy consideration to all who pray for the peace of jerusalem that so many several parties are still subsisting among those who are all styled christians this has been particularly observable in our own countrymen who have been continually dividing from each other upon points of no moment and many times such as religion had no concern in the most trifling circumstances have given rise to different parties which have continued for many generations and each of these would be ready to object to one who was on the other side he followeth not us   that expression may mean thirdly he differs from us in our religious opinions there was a time when all christians were of one mind as well as of one heart so great grace was upon them all when they were first filled with the holy ghost but how short a space did this blessing continue how soon was that unanimity lost and difference of opinion sprang up again even in the church of christ and that not in nominal but in real christians nay in the very chief of them the apostles themselves nor does it appear that the difference which then began was ever entirely removed we do not find that even those pillars in the temple of god so long as they remained upon the earth were ever brought to think alike to be of one mind particularly with regard to the ceremonial law it is therefore no way surprising that infinite varieties of opinion should now be found in the christian church a very probable consequence of this is that whenever we see any casting out devils he will be one that in this sense followeth not us that is not of our opinion it is scarce to be imagined he will be of our mind in all points even of religion he may very probably think in a different manner from us even on several subjects of importance such as the nature and use of the moral law the eternal decrees of god the sufficiency and efficacy of his grace and the perseverance of his children he may differ from us fourthly not only in opinion but likewise in some point of practice he may not approve of that manner of worshipping god which is practised in our congregation and may judge that to be more profitable for his soul which took its rise from calvin or martin luther he may have many objections to that liturgy which we approve of beyond all others many doubts concerning that form of church government which we esteem both apostolical and scriptural perhaps he may go farther from us yet he may from a principle of conscience refrain from several of those which we believe to be the ordinances of christ or if we both agree that they are ordained of god there may still remain a difference between us either as to the manner of administering those ordinances or the persons to whom they should be administered now the unavoidable consequence of any of these differences will be that he who thus differs from us must separate himself with regard to those points from our society in this respect therefore he followeth not us he is not as we phrase it of our church but in a far stronger sense he followeth not us who is not only of a different church but of such a church as we account to be in many respects antiscriptural and antichristian a church which we believe to be utterly false and erroneous in her doctrines as well as very dangerously wrong in her practice guilty of gross superstition as well as idolatry a church that has added many articles to the faith which was once delivered to the saints that has dropped one whole commandment of god and made void several of the rest by her traditions and that pretending the highest veneration for and strictest conformity to the ancient church has nevertheless brought in numberless innovations without any warrant either from antiquity or scripture now most certainly he followeth not us who stands at so great a distance from us and yet there may be a still wider difference than this he who differs from us in judgement or practice may possibly stand at a greater distance from us in affection than in judgement and this indeed is a very natural and a very common effect of the other the differences which begin in points of opinion seldom terminate there they generally spread into the affections and then separate chief friends nor are any animosities so deep and irreconcilable as those that spring from disagreement in religion for this cause the bitterest enemies of a man are those of his own household for this the father rises against his own children and the children against the father and perhaps persecute each other even to the death thinking all the time they are doing god service it is therefore nothing more than we may expect if those who differ from us either in religious opinions or practice soon contract a sharpness yea bitterness towards us if they are more and more prejudiced against us till they conceive as ill an opinion of our persons as of our principles an almost necessary consequence of this will be they will speak in the same manner as they think of us they will set themselves in opposition to us and as far as they are able hinder our work seeing it does not appear to them to be the work of god but either of man or of the devil he that thinks speaks and acts in such a manner as this in the highest sense followeth not us  i do not indeed conceive that the person of whom the apostle speaks in the text although we have no particular account of him either in the context or in any other part of holy writ went so far as this we have no ground to suppose that there was any material difference between him and the apostles much less that he had any prejudice either against them or their master it seems we may   gather thus much from our lords own words which immediately follow the text there is no man which shall do a miracle in my name that can lightly speak evil of me but i purposely put the case in the strongest light adding all the circumstances which can well be conceived that being forewarned of the temptation in its full strength we may in no case yield to it and fight against god iii 1 suppose then a man have no intercourse with us suppose he be not of our party suppose he separate from our church yea and widely differ from us both in judgement practice and affection yet if we see even this man casting out devils jesus saith forbid him not this important direction of our lord i am in the third place to explain if we see this man casting out devils but it is well if in such a case we would believe even what we saw with our eyes if we did not give the lie to our own senses he must be little acquainted with human nature who does not immediately perceive how extremely unready we should be to believe that any man does cast out devils who followeth not us in all or most of the senses above recited i had almost said in any of them seeing we may easily learn even from what passes in our own breasts how unwilling men are to allow anything good in those who do not in all things agree with themselves  but what is a sufficient reasonable proof that a man does in the sense above cast out devils the answer is easy is there full proof 1 that a person before us was a gross open sinner 2 that he is not so now that he has broke off his sins and lives a christian life and 3 that this change was wrought by his hearing this man preach if these three points be plain and undeniable then you have sufficient reasonable proof such as you cannot resist without wilful sin that this man casts out devils  then forbid him not beware how you attempt to hinder him either by your authority or arguments or persuasions do not in any wise strive to prevent his using all the power which god has given him if you have authority with him do not use that authority to stop the work of god do not furnish him with reasons why he ought not any more to speak in the name of jesus satan will not fail to supply him with these if you do not second him therein persuade him not to depart from the work if he should give place to the devil and you many souls might perish in their iniquity but their blood would god require at your hands but what if he be only a layman who casts out devils ought i not to forbid him then is the fact allowed is there reasonable proof that this man has or does cast out devils if there is forbid him not no not at the peril of your soul shall not god work by whom he will work no man can do these works unless god is with him unless god hath sent him for this very thing but if god hath sent him will you call him back will you forbid him to go but i do not know that he is sent of god now herein is a marvellous thing may any of the seals of his mission say any whom he hath brought from satan to god that ye know not whence this man is and behold he hath opened mine eyes if this man were not of god he could do nothing if you doubt the fact send for the parents of the man send for his brethren friends acquaintance but if you cannot doubt this if you must needs acknowledge that a notable miracle hath been wrought then with what conscience with what face can you charge him whom god hath sent not to speak any more in his name i allow that it is highly expedient whoever preaches in his name should have an outward as well as an inward call but that it is absolutely necessary i deny nay is not the scripture express no man taketh this honour unto himself but he that is called of god as was aaron heb 54 numberless times has this text been quoted on the occasion as containing the very strength of the cause but surely never was so unhappy a quotation for first aaron was not called to preach at all he was called to offer gifts and sacrifice for sin that was his peculiar employment secondly these   men do not offer sacrifice at all but only preach which aaron did not therefore it is not possible to find one text in all the bible which is more wide of the point than this but what was the practice of the apostolic age you may easily see in the acts of the apostles in the eighth chapter we read there was a great persecution against the church which was at jerusalem and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of judea and samaria except the apostles verse 1 therefore they that were scattered abroad went everywhere preaching the word verse 4 now were all these outwardly called to preach no man in his senses can think so here then is an undeniable proof what was the practice of the apostolic age here you see not one but a multitude of lay preachers men that were only sent of god indeed so far is the practice of the apostolic age from inclining us to think it was unlawful for a man to preach before he was ordained that we have reason to think it was then accounted necessary certainly the practice and the direction of the apostle paul was to prove a man before he was ordained at all let these the deacons says he first be proved then let them use the office of a deacon 1 tim 310 proved how by setting them to construe a sentence of greek and asking them a few commonplace questions o amazing proof of a minister of christ nay but by making a clear open trial as is still done by most of the protestant churches of europe not only whether their lives be holy and unblamable but whether they have such gifts as are absolutely and indispensably necessary in order to edify the church of christ but what if a man has these and has brought sinners to repentance and yet the bishop will not ordain him then the bishop does forbid him to cast out devils but i dare not forbid him i have published my reasons to all the world yet it is still insisted i ought to do it you who insist upon it answer those reasons i know not that any have done this yet or even made an attempt of doing it only some have spoken of them as very weak and trifling and this was prudent enough for it is far easier to despise at least seem to despise an argument than to answer it yet till this is done i must say when i have reasonable proof that any man does cast out devils whatever others do i dare not forbid him lest i be found even to fight against god and whosoever thou art that fearest god forbid him not either directly or indirectly there are many ways of doing this you indirectly forbid him if you either wholly deny or despise and make little account of the work which god has wrought by his hands you indirectly forbid him when you discourage him in his work by drawing him into disputes concerning it by raising objections against it or frightening him with consequences which very possibly will never be you forbid him when you show any unkindness toward him either in language or behaviour and much more when you speak of him to others either in an unkind or a contemptuous manner when you endeavour to represent him to any either in an odious or a despicable light you are forbidding him all the time you are speaking evil of him or making no account of his labours o forbid him not in any of these ways nor by forbidding others to hear him by discouraging sinners from hearing that word which is able to save their souls  yea if you would observe our lords direction in its full meaning and extent then remember his word he that is not for us is against us and he that gathereth not with me scattereth he that gathereth not men into the kingdom of god assuredly scatters them from it for there can be no neuter in this war every one is either on gods side or on satans are you on gods side then you will not only not forbid any man that casts out devils but you will labour to the uttermost of your power to forward him in the work you will readily acknowledge the work of god and confess the greatness of it you will remove all difficulties and objections as far as may be out of his way you will strengthen his hands by speaking honourably of him before all men and avowing the things which you have seen and heard you will encourage others to attend upon his word to hear him whom god hath sent and you will omit no actual proof of tender love which god gives you an opportunity of showing him  iv 1 if we willingly fail in any of these points if we either directly or indirectly forbid him because he followeth not us then we are bigots this is the inference i draw from what has been said but the term bigotry i fear as frequently as it is used is almost as little understood as enthusiasm it is too strong an attachment to or fondness for our own party opinion church and religion therefore   he is a bigot who is so fond of any of these so strongly attached to them as to forbid any who casts out devils because he differs from himself in any or all these particulars 2 do you beware of this take care 1 that you do not convict yourself of bigotry by your unreadiness to believe that any man does cast out devils who differs from you and if you are clear thus far if you acknowledge the fact then examine yourself 2 am i not convicted of bigotry in this in forbidding him directly or indirectly do i not directly forbid him on this ground because he is not of my party because he does not fall in with my opinions or because he does not worship god according to that scheme of religion which i have received from my fathers examine yourself do i not indirectly at least forbid him on any of these grounds am i not sorry that god should thus own and bless a man that holds such erroneous opinions do i not discourage him because he is not of my church by disputing with him concerning it by raising objections and by perplexing his mind with distant consequences do i show no anger contempt or unkindness of any sort either in my words or actions do i not mention behind his back his real or supposed faults his defects or infirmities do not i hinder sinners from hearing his word if you do any of these things you are a bigot to this day search me o lord and prove me try out my reins and my heart look well if there be any way of bigotry in me and lead me in the way everlasting in order to examine ourselves thoroughly let the case be proposed in the strongest manner what if i were to see a papist an arian a socinian casting out devils if i did i could not forbid even him without convicting myself of bigotry yea if it could be supposed that i should see a jew a deist or a turk doing the same were i to forbid him either directly or indirectly i should be no better than a bigot still o stand clear of this but be not content with not forbidding any that casts out devils it is well to go thus far but do not stop here if you will avoid all bigotry go on in every instance of this kind whatever the instrument be acknowledge the finger of god and not only acknowledge but rejoice in his work and praise his name with thanksgiving encourage whomsoever god is pleased to employ to give himself wholly up thereto speak well of him wheresoever you are defend his character and his mission enlarge as far as you can his sphere of action show him all kindness in word and deed and cease not to cry to god in his behalf that he may save both himself and them that hear him i need add but one caution think not the bigotry of another is any excuse for your own it is not impossible that one who casts out devils himself may yet forbid you so to do you may observe this is the very case mentioned in the text the apostles forbade another to do what they did themselves but beware of retorting it is not your part to return evil for evil anothers not observing the direction of our lord is no reason why you should neglect it nay but let him have all the bigotry to himself if he forbid you do not you forbid him rather labour and watch and pray the more to confirm your love toward him if he speak all manner of evil of you speak all manner of good that is true of him imitate herein that glorious saying of a great man o that he had always breathed the same spirit let luther call me a hundred devils i will still reverence him as a messenger of god   sermon 39 text of the 1872 edition sugdens number 34 catholic spirit and when he was departed thence he lighted on jehonadab the son of rechab coming to meet him and he saluted him and said to him is thine heart right as my heart is with thy heart and jehonadab answered it is if it be give me thine hand 2 kings 1015 it is allowed even by those who do not pay this great debt that love is due to all mankind the royal law thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself carrying its own evidence to all that hear it and that not according to the miserable construction put upon it by the zealots of old times thou shalt love thy neighbour thy relation acquaintance friend and hate thine enemy not so i say unto you said our lord love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them that despitefully use you and persecute you that ye may be the children may appear so to all mankind of your father which is in heaven who maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust but it is sure there is a peculiar love which we owe to those that love god so david all my delight is upon the saints that are in the earth and upon such as excel in virtue and so a greater than he a new commandment i give unto you that ye love one another as i have loved you that ye also love one another by this shall all men know that ye are my disciples if ye have love one to another john 1334 35 this is that love on which the apostle john so frequently and strongly insists this saith he is the message that ye heard from the beginning that we should love one another 1 john 311 hereby perceive we the love of god because he laid down his life for us and we ought if love should call us thereto to lay down our lives for the brethren verse 16 and again beloved let us love one another for love is of god he that loveth not knoweth not god for god is love 47 8 not that we loved god but that he loved us and sent his son to be the propitiation for our sins beloved if god so loved us we ought also to love one another verses 10 11  all men approve of this but do all men practise it daily experience shows the contrary where are even the christians who love one another as he hath given us commandment how many hindrances lie in the way the two grand general hindrances are first that they cannot all think alike and in consequence of this secondly they cannot all walk alike but in several smaller points their practice must differ in proportion to the difference of their sentiments but although a difference in opinions or modes of worship may prevent an entire external union yet need it prevent our union in affection though we cannot think alike may we not love alike may we not be of one heart though we are not of one opinion without all doubt we may herein all the children of god may unite notwithstanding these smaller differences these remaining as they are they may forward one another in love and in good works surely in this respect the example of jehu himself as mixed a character as he was of is well worthy both the attention and imitation of every serious christian and when he was departed thence he lighted on jehonadab the son of rechab coming to meet him and he saluted him and said to him is thine heart right as my heart is with thy heart and jehonadab answered it is if it be give me thine hand  the text naturally divides itself into two parts first a question proposed by jehu to jehonadab is thine heart right as my heart is with thy heart secondly an offer made on jehonadabs answering it is if it be give me thine hand i 1 and first let us consider the question proposed by jehu to jehonadab is thine heart right as my heart is with thy heart   the very first thing we may observe in these words is that here is no inquiry concerning jehonadabs opinions and yet it is certain he held some which were very uncommon indeed quite peculiar to himself and some which had a close influence upon his practice on which likewise he laid so great a stress as to entail them upon his childrens children to their latest posterity this is evident from the account given by jeremiah many years after his death i took jaazaniah and his brethren and all his sons and the whole house of the rechabites    and set before them pots full of wine and cups and said unto them drink ye wine but they said we will drink no wine for jonadab or jehonadab the son of rechab our father it would be less ambiguous if the words were placed thus jehonadab our father the son of rechab out of love and reverence to whom he probably desired his descendants might be called by his name commanded us saying ye shall drink no wine neither ye nor your sons for ever neither shall ye build house nor sow seed nor plant vineyard nor have any but all your days ye shall dwell in tents and we have obeyed and done according to all that jonadab our father commanded us jer 35310 and yet jehu although it seems to have been his manner both in things secular and religious to drive furiously does not concern himself at all with any of these things but lets jehonadab abound in his own sense and neither of them appears to have given the other the least disturbance touching the opinions which he maintained it is very possible that many good men now also may entertain peculiar opinions and some of them may be as singular herein as even jehonadab was and it is certain so long as we know but in part that all men will not see all things alike it is an unavoidable consequence of the present weakness and shortness of human understanding that several men will be of several minds in religion as well as in common life so it has been from the beginning of the world and so it will be till the restitution of all things nay farther although every man necessarily believes that every particular opinion which he holds is true for to believe any opinion is not true is the same thing as not to hold it yet can no man be assured that all his own opinions taken together are true nay every thinking man is assured they are not seeing humanum est errare et nescire to be ignorant of many things and to mistake in some is the necessary condition of humanity this therefore he is sensible is his own case he knows in the general that he himself is mistaken although in what particulars he mistakes he does not perhaps he cannot know i say perhaps he cannot know for who can tell how far invincible ignorance may extend or that comes to the same thing invincible prejudice which is often so fixed in tender minds that it is afterwards impossible to tear up what has taken so deep a root and who can say unless he knew every circumstance attending it how far any mistake is culpable seeing all guilt must suppose some concurrence of the will of which he only can judge who searcheth the heart every wise man therefore will allow others the same liberty of thinking which he desires they should allow him and will no more insist on their embracing his opinions than he would have them to insist on his embracing theirs he bears with those who differ from him and only asks him with whom he desires to unite in love that single question is thy heart right as my heart is with thy heart  we may secondly observe that here is no inquiry made concerning jehonadabs mode of worship although it is highly probable there was in this respect also a very wide difference between them for we may well believe jehonadab as well as all his posterity worshipped god at jerusalem whereas jehu did not he had more regard to statepolicy than religion and therefore although he slew the worshippers of baal and destroyed baal out of israel yet from the convenient sin of jeroboam the worship of the golden calves he departed not 2 kings 1029 but even among men of an upright heart men who desire to have a conscience void of offence it must needs be that as long as there are various opinions there will be various ways of worshipping god seeing a variety of opinion necessarily implies a variety of practice and as in all ages men have differed in nothing more than in their opinions concerning the supreme being so in nothing have they more differed from each other than in the manner of worshipping him had this been only   in the heathen world it would not have been at all surprising for we know these by their wisdom knew not god nor therefore could they know how to worship him but is it not strange that even in the christian world although they all agree in the general god is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth yet the particular modes of worshipping god are almost as various as among the heathens and how shall we choose among so much variety no man can choose for or prescribe to another but every one must follow the dictates of his own conscience in simplicity and godly sincerity he must be fully persuaded in his own mind and then act according to the best light he has nor has any creature power to constrain another to walk by his own rule god has given no right to any of the children of men thus to lord it over the conscience of his brethren but every man must judge for himself as every man must give an account of himself to god although therefore every follower of christ is obliged by the very nature of the christian institution to be a member of some particular congregation or other some church as it is usually termed which implies a particular manner of worshipping god for two cannot walk together unless they be agreed yet none can be obliged by any power on earth but that of his own conscience to prefer this or that congregation to another this or that particular manner of worship i know it is commonly supposed that the place of our birth fixes the church to which we ought to belong that one for instance who is born in england ought to be a member of that which is styled the church of england and consequently to worship god in the particular manner which is prescribed by that church i was once a zealous maintainer of this but i find many reasons to abate of this zeal i fear it is attended with such difficulties as no reasonable man can get over not the least of which is that if this rule had took place there could have been no reformation from popery seeing it entirely destroys the right of private judgement on which that whole reformation stands i dare not therefore presume to impose my mode of worship on any other i believe it is truly primitive and apostolical but my belief is no rule for another i ask not therefore of him with whom i would unite in love are you of my church of my congregation do you receive the same form of church government and allow the same church officers with me do you join in the same form of prayer wherein i worship god i inquire not do you receive the supper of the lord in the same posture and manner that i do nor whether in the administration of baptism you agree with me in admitting sureties for the baptized in the manner of administering it or the age of those to whom it should be administered nay i ask not of you as clear as i am in my own mind whether you allow baptism and the lords supper at all let all these things stand by we will talk of them if need be at a more convenient season my only question at present is this is thine heart right as my heart is with thy heart  but what is properly implied in the question i do not mean what did jehu imply therein but what should a follower of christ understand thereby when he proposes it to any of his brethren the first thing implied is this is thy heart right with god dost thou believe his being and his perfections his eternity immensity wisdom power his justice mercy and truth dost thou believe that he now upholdeth all things by the word of his power and that he governs even the most minute even the most noxious to his own glory and the good of them that love him hast thou a divine evidence a supernatural conviction of the things of god dost thou walk by faith not by sight looking not at temporal things but things eternal dost thou believe in the lord jesus christ god over all blessed for ever is he revealed in thy soul dost thou know jesus christ and him crucified does he dwell in thee and thou in him is he formed in thy heart by faith having absolutely disclaimed all thy own works thy own righteousness hast thou submitted thyself unto the righteousness of god which is by faith in christ jesus art thou found in him not having thy own righteousness but the righteousness which is by faith and art thou through him fighting the good fight of faith and laying hold of eternal life is thy faith energoumene di agapes filled with the energy of love dost thou love god i do not say above all things for it is both an unscriptural and an ambiguous expression but with all thy heart and with all thy mind and with all thy soul and with all thy strength dost thou seek all   thy happiness in him alone and dost thou find what thou seekest does thy soul continually magnify the lord and thy spirit rejoice in god thy saviour having learned in everything to give thanks dost thou find it is a joyful and a pleasant thing to be thankful is god the centre of thy soul the sum of all thy desires art thou accordingly laying up thy treasure in heaven and counting all things else dung and dross hath the love of god cast the love of the world out of thy soul then thou art crucified to the world thou art dead to all below and thy life is hid with christ in god art thou employed in doing not thy own will but the will of him that sent thee of him that sent thee down to sojourn here awhile to spend a few days in a strange land till having finished the work he hath given thee to do thou return to thy fathers house is it thy meat and drink to do the will of thy father which is in heaven is thine eye single in all things always fixed on him always looking unto jesus dost thou point at him in whatsoever thou doest in all thy labour thy business thy conversation aiming only at the glory of god in all whatsoever thou doest either in word or deed doing it all in the name of the lord jesus giving thanks unto god even the father through him  does the love of god constrain thee to serve him with fear to rejoice unto him with reverence art thou more afraid of displeasing god than either of death or hell is nothing so terrible to thee as the thought of offending the eyes of his glory upon this ground dost thou hate all evil ways every transgression of his holy and perfect law and herein exercise thyself to have a conscience void of offence toward god and toward man is thy heart right toward thy neighbour dost thou love as thyself all mankind without exception if you love those only that love you what thank have ye do you love your enemies is your soul full of goodwill of tender affection toward them do you love even the enemies of god the unthankful and unholy do your bowels yearn over them could you wish yourself temporally accursed for their sake and do you show this by blessing them that curse you and praying for those that despitefully use you and persecute you 18 do you show your love by your works while you have time as you have opportunity do you in fact do good to all men neighbours or strangers friends or enemies good or bad do you do them all the good you can endeavouring to supply all their wants assisting them both in body and soul to the uttermost of your power if thou art thus minded may every christian say yea if thou art but sincerely desirous of it and following on till thou attain then thy heart is right as my heart is with thy heart ii 1 if it be give me thy hand i do not mean be of my opinion you need not i do not expect or desire it neither do i mean i will be of your opinion i cannot it does not depend on my choice i can no more think than i can see or hear as i will keep you your opinion i mine and that as steadily as ever you need not even endeavour to come over to me or bring me over to you i do not desire you to dispute those points or to hear or speak one word concerning them let all opinions alone on one side and the other only give me thine hand 2 i do not mean embrace my modes of worship or i will embrace yours this also is a thing which does not depend either on your choice or mine we must both act as each is fully persuaded in his own mind hold you fast that which you believe is most acceptable to god and i will do the same i believe the episcopal form of church government to be scriptural and apostolical if you think the presbyterian or independent is better think so still and act accordingly i believe infants ought to be baptized and that this may be done either by dipping or sprinkling if you are otherwise persuaded be so still and follow your own persuasion it appears to me that forms of prayer are of excellent use particularly in the great congregation if you judge extemporary prayer to be of more use act suitable to your own judgement my sentiment is that i ought not to forbid water wherein persons may be baptized and that i ought to eat bread and drink wine as a memorial of my dying master however if you are not convinced of this act according to the light you have i have no desire to dispute with you one moment upon any of the preceding heads let all these smaller points stand aside let them never come into sight if thine heart is as my heart if thou lovest god and all mankind i ask no more give me thine hand   i mean first love me and that not only as thou lovest all mankind not only as thou lovest thine enemies or the enemies of god those that hate thee that despitefully use thee and persecute thee not only as a stranger as one of whom thou knowest neither good nor evil i am not satisfied with this no if thine heart be right as mine with thy heart then love me with a very tender affection as a friend that is closer than a brother as a brother in christ a fellow citizen of the new jerusalem a fellow soldier engaged in the same warfare under the same captain of our salvation love me as a companion in the kingdom and patience of jesus and a joint heir of his glory love me but in a higher degree than thou dost the bulk of mankind with the love that is longsuffering and kind that is patient if i am ignorant or out of the way bearing and not increasing my burden and is tender soft and compassionate still that envieth not if at any time it please god to prosper me in his work even more than thee love me with the love that is not provoked either at my follies or infirmities or even at my acting if it should sometimes so appear to thee not according to the will of god love me so as to think no evil of me to put away all jealousy and evilsurmising love me with the love that covereth all things that never reveals either my faults or infirmities that believeth all things is always willing to think the best to put the fairest construction on all my words and actions that hopeth all things either that the thing related was never done or not done with such circumstances as are related or at least that it was done with a goodintention or in a sudden stress of temptation and hope to the end that whatever is amiss will by the grace of god be corrected and whatever is wanting supplied through the riches of his mercy in christ jesus 5 i mean secondly commend me to god in all thy prayers wrestle with him in my behalf that he would speedily correct what he sees amiss and supply what is wanting in me in thy nearest access to the throne of grace beg of him who is then very present with thee that my heart may be more as thy heart more right both toward god and toward man that i may have a fuller conviction of things not seen and a stronger view of the love of god in christ jesus may more steadily walk by faith not by sight and more earnestly grasp eternal life pray that the love of god and of all mankind may be more largely poured into my heart that i may be more fervent and active in doing the will of my father which is in heaven more zealous of good works and more careful to abstain from all appearance of evil  i mean thirdly provoke me to love and to good works second thy prayer as thou hast opportunity by speaking to me in love whatsoever thou believest to be for my souls health quicken me in the work which god has given me to do and instruct me how to do it more perfectly yea smite me friendly and reprove me whereinsoever i appear to thee to be doing rather my own will than the will of him that sent me o speak and spare not whatever thou believest may conduce either to the amending my faults the strengthening my weakness the building me up in love or the making me more fit in any kind for the masters use i mean lastly love me not in word only but in deed and in truth so far as in conscience thou canst retaining still thy own opinions and thy own manner of worshipping god join with me in the work of god and let us go on hand in hand and thus far it is certain thou mayest go speak honourably wherever thou art of the work of god by whomsoever he works and kindly of his messengers and if it be in thy power not only sympathize with them when they are in any difficulty or distress but give them a cheerful and effectual assistance that they may glorify god on thy behalf two things should be observed with regard to what has been spoken under this last head the one that whatsoever love whatsoever offices of love whatsoever spiritual or temporal assistance i claim from him whose heart is right as my heart is with his the same i am ready by the grace of god according to my measure to give him the other that i have not made this claim in behalf of myself only but of all whose heart is right toward god and man that we may all love one another as christ hath loved us   iii 1 one inference we may make from what has been said we may learn from hence what is a catholic spirit   there is scarce any expression which has been more grossly misunderstood and more dangerously misapplied than this but it will be easy for any who calmly consider the preceding observations to correct any such misapprehensions of it and to prevent any such misapplication for from hence we may learn first that a catholic spirit is not speculative latitudinarianism it is not an indifference to all opinions this is the spawn of hell not the offspring of heaven this unsettledness of thought this being driven to and fro and tossed about with every wind of doctrine is a great curse not a blessing an irreconcilable enemy not a friend to true catholicism a man of a truly catholic spirit has not now his religion to seek he is fixed as the sun in his judgement concerning the main branches of christian doctrine it is true he is always ready to hear and weigh whatsoever can be offered against his principles but as this does not show any wavering in his own mind so neither does it occasion any he does not halt between two opinions nor vainly endeavour to blend them into one observe this you who know not what spirit ye are of who call yourselves men of a catholic spirit only because you are of a muddy understanding because your mind is all in a mist because you have no settled consistent principles but are for jumbling all opinions together be convinced that you have quite missed your way you know not where you are you think you are got into the very spirit of christ when in truth you are nearer the spirit of antichrist go first and learn the first elements of the gospel of christ and then shall you learn to be of a truly catholic spirit from what has been said we may learn secondly that a catholic spirit is not any kind of practical latitudinarianism it is not indifference as to public worship or as to the outward manner of performing it this likewise would not be a blessing but a curse far from being an help thereto it would so long as it remained be an unspeakable hindrance to the worshipping of god in spirit and in truth but the man of a truly catholic spirit having weighed all things in the balance of the sanctuary has no doubt no scruple at all concerning that particular mode of worship wherein he joins he is clearly convinced that this manner of worshipping god is both scriptural and rational he knows none in the world which is more scriptural none which is more rational therefore without rambling hither and thither he cleaves close thereto and praises god for the opportunity of so doing hence we may thirdly learn that a catholic spirit is not indifference to all congregations this is another sort of latitudinarianism no less absurd and unscriptural than the former but it is far from a man of a truly catholic spirit he is fixed in his congregation as well as his principles he is united to one not only in spirit but by all the outward ties of christian fellowship there he partakes of all the ordinances of god there he receives the supper of the lord there he pours out his soul in public prayer and joins in public praise and thanksgiving there he rejoices to hear the word of reconciliation the gospel of the grace of god with these his nearest his bestbeloved brethren on solemn occasions he seeks god by fasting these particularly he watches over in love as they do over his soul admonishing exhorting comforting reproving and every way building up each other in the faith these he regards as his own household and therefore according to the ability god has given him naturally cares for them and provides that they may have all the things that are needful for life and godliness  but while he is steadily fixed in his religious principles in what he believes to be the truth as it is in jesus while he firmly adheres to that worship of god which he judges to be most acceptable in his sight and while he is united by the tenderest and closest ties to one particular congregation his heart is enlarged toward all mankind those he knows and those he does not he embraces with strong and cordial affection neighbours and strangers friends and enemies this is catholic or universal love and he that has this is of a catholic spirit for love alone gives the title to this character catholic love is a catholic spirit if then we take this word in the strictest sense a man of a catholic spirit is one who in the manner abovementioned gives his hand to all whose hearts are right with his heart one who knows how to value and praise god for all the advantages he enjoys with regard to the knowledge of the things of god the true scriptural manner of worshipping him and above all his union with a congregation fearing god and working righteousness one who retaining these blessings with the strictest care keeping them as the apple of his eye at the same time lovesas friends as brethren in the lord as members of christ and children of god as joint partakers now of the present kingdom of god and fellow heirs of his eternal kingdomall of whatever opinion or worship or congregation who believe   in the lord jesus christ who love god and man who rejoicing to please and fearing to offend god are careful to abstain from evil and zealous of good works he is the man of a truly catholic spirit who bears all these continually upon his heart who having an unspeakable tenderness for their persons and longing for their welfare does not cease to commend them to god in prayer as well as to plead their cause before men who speaks comfortably to them and labours by all his words to strengthen their hands in god he assists them to the uttermost of his power in all things spiritual and temporal he is ready to spend and be spent for them yea to lay down his life for their sake 6 thou o man of god think on these things if thou art already in this way go on if thou hast heretofore mistook the path bless god who hath brought thee back and now run the race which is set before thee in the royal way of universal love take heed lest thou be either wavering in thy judgement or straitened in thy bowels but keep an even pace rooted in the faith once delivered to the saints and grounded in love in true catholic love till thou art swallowed up in love for ever and ever charles wesleys hymn catholic love added in some editions weary of all this wordy strife these notions forms and modes and names to thee the way the truth the life whose love my simple heart inflames divinely taught at last i fly with thee and thine to live and die forth from the midst of babel brought parties and sects i cast behind enlarged my heart and free my thought whereer the latent truth i find the latent truth with joy to own and bow to jesus name alone redeemd by thine almighty grace i taste my glorious liberty with open arms the world embrace but cleave to those who cleave to thee but only in thy saints delight who walk with god in purest white one with the little flock i rest the members sound who hold the head the chosen few with pardon blest and by th anointing spirit led   into the mind that was in thee into the depths of deity my brethren friends and kinsmen these who do my heavenly fathers will who aim at perfect holiness and all thy counsels to fulfil athirst to be whateer thou art and love their god with all their heart for these howeer in flesh disjoind whereer dispersed oer earth abroad unfeignd unbounded love i find and constant as the life of god fountain of life from thence it sprung as pure as even and as strong joind to the hidden church unknown in this sure bond of perfectness obscurely safe i dwell alone and glory in th uniting grace to me to each believer given to all thy saints in earth and heaven charles wesley   sermon 40 text of the 1872 edition christian perfection not as though i had already attained either were already perfect phil 312 there is scarce any expression in holy writ which has given more offence than this the word perfect is what many cannot bear the very sound of it is an abomination to them and whosoever preaches perfection as the phrase is that is asserts that it is attainable in this life runs great hazard of being accounted by them worse than a heathen man or a publican and hence some have advised wholly to lay aside the use of those expressions because they have given so great offence but are they not found in the oracles of god if so by what authority can any messenger of god lay them aside even though all men should be offended we have not so learned christ neither may we thus give place to the devil whatsoever god hath spoken that will we speak whether men will hear or whether they will forbear knowing that then alone can any minister of christ be pure from the blood of all men when he hath not shunned to declare unto them all the counsel of god acts 2026 27 we may not therefore lay these expressions aside seeing they are the words of god and not of man but we may and ought to explain the meaning of them that those who are sincere of heart may not err to the right hand or to the left from the mark of the prize of their high calling and this is the more needful to be done because in the verse already repeated the apostle speaks of himself as not perfect not saith he as though i were already perfect and yet immediately after in the fifteenth verse he speaks of himself yea and many others as perfect let us saith he as many as be perfect be thus minded phil 315 in order therefore to remove the difficulty arising from this seeming contradiction as well as to give light to them who are pressing forward to the mark and that those who are lame be not turned out of the way i shall endeavor to show first in what sense christians are not and secondly in what sense they are perfect i 1 in the first place i shall endeavor to show in what sense christians are not perfect and both from experience and scripture it appears first that they are not perfect in knowledge they are not so perfect in this life as to be free from ignorance they know it may be in common with other men many things relating to the present world and they know with regard to the world to come the general truths which god hath revealed they know likewise what the natural man receiveth not for these things are spiritually discerned what manner of love it is wherewith the father hath loved them that they should be called the sons of god 1 john 31 they know the mighty working of his spirit in their hearts eph 316 and the wisdom of his providence directing all their paths prov 36 and causing all things to work together for their good rom 828 yea they know in every circumstance of life what the lord requireth of them and how to keep a conscience void of offence both toward god and toward man acts 2416 2 but innumerable are the things which they know not touching the almighty himself they cannot search him out to perfection lo these are but a part of his ways but the thunder of his power who can understand job 2614 they cannot understand i will not say how there are three that bear record in heaven the father the son and the holy spirit and these three are one 1 john 57 or how the eternal son of god took upon himself the form of a servant phil 27  but not any one attribute not any one circumstance of the divine nature 2 pet 14 neither is it for them to know the times and seasons acts 17 when god will work his great works upon the earth no not even those which he hath in part revealed by his servants and prophets since the world began see amos 37   much less do they know when god having accomplished the number of his elect will hasten his kingdom when the heavens shall pass away with a great noise and the elements shall melt with fervent heat 2 pet 310 they know not the reasons even of many of his present dispensations with the sons of men but are constrained to rest here  though clouds and darkness are round about him righteousness and judgment are the habitation of his seat ps 972 yea often with regard to his dealings with themselves doth their lord say unto them what i do thou knowest not now but thou shalt know hereafter john 137 and how little do they know of what is ever before them of even the visible works of his hands  how he spreadeth the north over the empty place and hangeth the earth upon nothing job 267 how he unites all the parts of this vast machine by a secret chain which cannot be broken so great is the ignorance so very little the knowledge of even the best of men no one then is so perfect in this life as to be free from ignorance nor secondly from mistake which indeed is almost an unavoidable consequence of it seeing those who know but in part 1 cor 1312 are ever liable to err touching the things which they know not it is true the children of god do not mistake as to the things essential to salvation they do not put darkness for light or light for darkness isa 520 neither seek death in the error of their life wisdom 112 for they are taught of god and the way which he teaches them the way of holiness is so plain that the wayfaring man though a fool need not err therein isa 358 but in things unessential to salvation they do err and that frequently the best and wisest of men are frequently mistaken even with regard to facts believing those things not to have been which really were or those to have been done which were not or suppose they are not mistaken as to the fact itself they may be with regard to its circumstances believing them or many of them to have been quite different from what in truth they were and hence cannot but arise many farther mistakes hence they may believe either past or present actions which were or are evil to be good and such as were or are good to be evil hence also they may judge not according to truth with regard to the characters of men and that not only by supposing good men to be better or wicked men to be worse than they are but by believing them to have been or to be good men who were or are very wicked or perhaps those to have been or to be wicked men who were or are holy and unreprovable  nay with regard to the holy scriptures themselves as careful as they are to avoid it the best of men are liable to mistake and do mistake day by day especially with respect to those parts thereof which less immediately relate to practice hence even the children of god are not agreed as to the interpretation of many places in holy writ nor is their difference of opinion any proof that they are not the children of god on either side but it is a proof that we are no more to expect any living man to be infallible than to be omniscient if it be objected to what has been observed under this and the preceding head that st john speaking to his brethren in the faith says ye have an unction from the holy one and ye know all things 1 john 220 the answer is plain ye know all things that are needful for your souls health cf 3 john 2 that the apostle never designed to extend this farther that he could not speak it in an absolute sense is clear first from hence  that otherwise he would describe the disciple as above his master seeing christ himself as man knew not all things of that hour saith he knoweth no man no not the son but the father only mark 1332 it is clear secondly from the apostles own words that follow these things have i written unto you concerning them that deceive you cf 1 john 37 as well as from his frequently repeated caution let no man deceive you see mark 135 eph 56 2 thess 23 which had been altogether needless had not those very persons who had that unction from the holy one 1 john 220 been liable not to ignorance only but to mistake also  even christians therefore are not so perfect as to be free either from ignorance or error we may thirdly add nor from infirmities  only let us take care to understand this word aright only let us not give that soft title to known sins as the manner of some is so one man tells us every man has his infirmity and mine is drunkenness another has the infirmity of uncleanness another of taking gods holy name in vain and yet another has the infirmity of calling his brother thou fool matt 522 or returning railing for railing 1 pet 39 it is plain that all you who thus speak if ye repent not shall with your infirmities go quick into hell but i mean hereby not only those which are   properly termed bodily infirmities but all those inward or outward imperfections which are not of a moral nature such are the weakness or slowness of understanding dulness or confusedness of apprehension incoherency of thought irregular quickness or heaviness of imagination such to mention no more of this kind is the want of a ready or of a retentive memory such in another kind are those which are commonly in some measure consequent upon these namely slowness of speech impropriety of language ungracefulness of pronunciation to which one might add a thousand nameless defects either in conversation or behaviour these are the infirmities which are found in the best of men in a larger or smaller proportion and from these none can hope to be perfectly freed till the spirit returns to god that gave it eccles 127 nor can we expect till then to be wholly free from temptation such perfection belongeth not to this life it is true there are those who being given up to work all uncleanness with greediness eph 419 scarce perceive the temptations which they resist not and so seem to be without temptation there are also many whom the wise enemy of souls seeing to be fast asleep in the dead form of godliness will not tempt to gross sin lest they should awake before they drop into everlasting burnings i know there are also children of god who being now justified freely rom 51 having found redemption in the blood of christ eph 17 for the present feel no temptation god hath said to their enemies touch not mine anointed and do my children no harm see 1 chron 1622 and for this season it may be for weeks or months he causeth them to ride on high places deut 3213 he beareth them as on eagles wings exod 194 above all the fiery darts of the wicked one eph 616 but this state will not last always as we may learn from that single consideration  that the son of god himself in the days of his flesh was tempted even to the end of his life heb 218 415 67 therefore so let his servant expect to be for it is enough that he be as his master luke 640 christian perfection therefore does not imply as some men seem to have imagined an exemption either from ignorance or mistake or infirmities or temptations indeed it is only another term for holiness they are two names for the same thing thus every one that is perfect is holy and every one that is holy is in the scripture sense perfect yet we may lastly observe that neither in this respect is there any absolute perfection on earth there is no perfection of degrees as it is termed none which does not admit of a continual increase so that how much soever any man hath attained or in how high a degree soever he is perfect he hath still need to grow in grace 2 pet 318 and daily to advance in the knowledge and love of god his saviour see phil 19 ii 1 in what sense then are christians perfect this is what i shall endeavor in the second place to show but it should be premised that there are several stages in christian life as in natural some of the children of god being but newborn babes others having attained to more maturity and accordingly st john in his first epistle 1 john 212 c applies himself severally to those he terms little children those he styles young men and those whom he entitles fathers i write unto you little children saith the apostle because your sins are forgiven you because thus far you have attained  being justified freely you have peace with god through jesus christ rom 51 i write unto you young men because ye have overcome the wicked one or as he afterwards addeth because ye are strong and the word of god abideth in you 1 john 213 14 ye have quenched the fiery darts of the wicked one eph 616 the doubts and fears wherewith he disturbed your first peace and the witness of god that your sins are forgiven now abideth in your heart i write unto you fathers because ye have known him that is from the beginning 1 john 213 ye have known both the father and the son and the spirit of christ in your inmost soul ye are perfect men being grown up to the measure of the stature of the fulness of christ eph 413 2 it is of these chiefly i speak in the latter part of this discourse for these only are properly christians but even babes in christ are in such a sense perfect or born of god an expression taken also in divers senses as first not to commit sin if any doubt of this privilege of the sons of god the question is not to be decided by abstract reasonings which may be drawn out into an endless length and leave the point just as it was before neither is it to be determined by the experience of this or that particular person many may suppose they do not commit sin when they do but this proves nothing either way to the law and to the testimony we appeal let god be true and every man a liar rom 34 by his word will we abide and that alone hereby we ought to be judged   now the word of god plainly declares that even those who are justified who are born again in the lowest sense do not continue in sin that they cannot live any longer therein rom 61 2 that they are planted together in the likeness of the death of christ rom 65 that their old man is crucified with him the body of sin being destroyed so that henceforth they do not serve sin that being dead with christ they are free from sin rom 66 7 that they are dead unto sin and alive unto god rom 611 that sin hath no more dominion over them who are not under the law but under grace but that these being free from sin are become the servants of righteousness rom 614 18  the very least which can be implied in these words is that the persons spoken of therein namely all real christians or believers in christ are made free from outward sin and the same freedom which st paul here expresses in such variety of phrases st peter expresses in that one 1 pet 41 2 he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin  that he no longer should live to the desires of men but to the will of god for this ceasing from sin if it be interpreted in the lowest sense as regarding only the outward behaviour must denote the ceasing from the outward act from any outward transgression of the law 5  but most express are the wellknown words of st john in the third chapter of his first epistle verse 8 c he that committeth sin is of the devil for the devil sinneth from the beginning for this purpose the son of god was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil whosoever is born of god doth not commit sin for his seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he is born of god 1 john 38 9 and those in the fifth 1 john 518 we know that whosoever is born of god sinneth not but he that is begotten of god keepeth himself and that wicked one toucheth him not  indeed it is said this means only he sinneth not wilfully or he doth not commit sin habitually or not as other men do or not as he did before but by whom is this said by stjohn no there is no such word in the text nor in the whole chapter nor in all his epistle nor in any part of his writings whatsoever why then the best way to answer a bold assertion is simply to deny it and if any man can prove it from the word of god let him bring forth his strong reasons and a sort of reason there is which has been frequently brought to support these strange assertions drawn from the examples recorded in the word of god what say they did not abraham himself commit sin  prevaricating and denying his wife did not moses commit sin when he provoked god at the waters of strife nay to produce one for all did not even david the man after gods own heart commit sin in the matter of uriah the hittite even murder and adultery it is most sure he did all this is true but what is it you would infer from hence it may be granted first that david in the general course of his life was one of the holiest men among the jews and secondly that the holiest men among the jews did sometimes commit sin but if you would hence infer that all christians do and must commit sin as long as they live this consequence we utterly deny it will never follow from those premises those who argue thus seem never to have considered that declaration of our lord matt 1111 verily i say unto you among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than john the baptist notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he i fear indeed there are some who have imagined the kingdom of heaven here to mean the kingdom of glory as if the son of god had just discovered to us that the least glorified saint in heaven is greater than any man upon earth to mention this is sufficiently to refute it there can therefore no doubt be made but the kingdom of heaven here as in the following verse where it is said to be taken by force matt 1112 or the kingdom of god as st luke expresses it  is that kingdom of god on earth whereunto all true believers in christ all real christians belong in these words then our lord declares two things first that before his coming in the flesh among all the children of men there had not been one greater than john the baptist whence it evidently follows that neither abraham david nor any jew was greater than john our lord secondly declares that he which is least in the kingdom of god in that kingdom which he came to set up on earth and which the violent now began to take by force is greater than he  not a greater prophet as some have interpreted the word for this is palpably false in fact but greater in the grace of god and the knowledge of our lord jesus christ therefore we cannot measure the privileges of real christians by those formerly given to the   jews their ministration or dispensation we allow was glorious but ours exceeds in glory 2 cor 379 so that whosoever would bring down the christian dispensation to the jewish standard whosoever gleans up the examples of weakness recorded in the law and the prophets and thence infers that they who have put on christ gal 327 are endued with no greater strength doth greatly err neither knowing the scriptures nor the power of god matt 2229 but are there not assertions in scripture which prove the same thing if it cannot be inferred from those examples does not the scripture say expressly even a just man sinneth seven times a day i answer no the scripture says no such thing there is no such text in all the bible that which seems to be intended is the sixteenth verse of the twentyfourth chapter of the proverbs the words of which are these a just man falleth seven times and riseth up again prov 2416 but this is quite another thing for first the words a day are not in the text so that if a just man falls seven times in his life it is as much as is affirmed here secondly here is no mention of falling into sin at all what is here mentioned is falling into temporal affliction this plainly appears from the verse before the words of which are these lay not wait o wicked man against the dwelling of the righteous spoil not his resting place prov 2415 it follows for a just man falleth seven times and riseth up again but the wicked shall fall into mischief as if he had said god will deliver him out of his trouble but when thou fallest there shall be none to deliver thee but however in other places continue the objectors solomon does assert plainly there is no man that sinneth not 1 kings 846 2 chron 636 yea there is not a just man upon earth that doeth good and sinneth not eccles 720 i answer without doubt thus it was in the days of solomon yea thus it was from adam to moses from moses to solomon and from solomon to christ there was then no man that sinned not even from the day that sin entered into the world there was not a just man upon earth that did good and sinned not until the son of god was manifested to take away our sins it is unquestionably true that the heir as long as he is a child differeth nothing from a servant gal 41 and that even so they all the holy men of old who were under the jewish dispensation were during that infant state of the church in bondage under the elements of the world gal 43 but when the fulness of the time was come god sent forth his son made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that they might receive the adoption of sons gal 44  that they might receive that grace which is now made manifest by the appearing of our saviour jesus christ who hath abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel 2 tim 110 now therefore they are no more servants but sons see gal 47 so that whatsoever was the case of those under the law we may safely affirm with st john that since the gospel was given he that is born of god sinneth not 1 john 518 it is of great importance to observe and that more carefully than is commonly done the wide difference there is between the jewish and the christian dispensation and that ground of it which the same apostle assigns in the seventh chapter of his gospel john 738 c after he had there related those words of our blessed lord he that believeth on me as the scripture hath said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water he immediately subjoins this spake he of the spirit ou emellon lambanein hoi pisteuontes eis auton  which they who should believe on him were afterwards to receive for the holy ghost was not yet given because that jesus was not yet glorified john 739 now the apostle cannot mean here as some have taught that the miracleworking power of the holy ghost was not yet given for this was given our lord had given it to all the apostles when he first sent them forth to preach the gospel he then gave them power over unclean spirits to cast them out power to heal the sick yea to raise the dead mark 108 but the holy ghost was not yet given in his sanctifying graces as he was after jesus was glorified it was then when he ascended up on high and led captivity captive that he received those gifts for men yea even for the rebellious that the lord god might dwell among them ps 6818 cf eph 48 and when the day of pentecost was fully come acts 21 then first it was that they who waited for the promise of the father acts 14 were made more than conquerors rom 837 over sin by the holy ghost given unto them that this great salvation from sin was not given till jesus was glorified st peter also plainly testifies where speaking of his brethren in the flesh as now receiving the end of their faith the salvation of their souls he adds 1 peter 19 10 c of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently who prophesied of the grace that is the gracious dispensation that should come unto you searching what or what manner of time the spirit of christ which was in   them did signify when it testified beforehand the sufferings of christ and the glory the glorious salvation that should follow unto whom it was revealed that not unto themselves but unto us they did minister the things which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the holy ghost sent down from heaven 1 pet 112 viz at the day of pentecost and so unto all generations into the hearts of all true believers on this ground even the grace which was brought unto them by the revelation of jesus christ 1 pet 113 the apostle might well build that strong exhortation wherefore girding up the loins of your mind  as he which hath called you is holy so be ye holy in all manner of conversation 1 pet 113 those who have duly considered these things must allow that the privileges of christians are in no wise to be measured by what the old testament records concerning those who were under the jewish dispensation seeing the fulness of times is now come the holy ghost is now given the great salvation of god is brought unto men by the revelation of jesus christ the kingdom of heaven is now set up on earth concerning which the spirit of god declared of old so far is david from being the pattern or standard of christian perfection he that is feeble among them at that day shall be as david and the house of david shall be as god as the angel of the lord before them zech 128 if therefore you would prove that the apostles words he that is born of god sinneth not 1 john 518 are not to be understood according to their plain natural obvious meaning it is from the new testament you are to bring your proofs else you will fight as one that beateth the air 1 cor 926 and the first of these which is usually brought is taken from the examples recorded in the new testament the apostles themselves it is said committed sin nay the greatest of them peter and paul st paul by his sharp contention with barnabas acts 1539 and st peter by his dissimulation at antioch gal 211 well suppose both peter and paul did then commit sin what is it you would infer from hence that all the other apostles committed sin sometimes there is no shadow of proof in this or would you thence infer that all the other christians of the apostolic age committed sin worse and worse this is such an inference as one would imagine a man in his senses could never have thought of or will you argue thus if two of the apostles did once commit sin then all other christians in all ages do and will commit sin as long as they live alas my brother a child of common understanding would be ashamed of such reasoning as this least of all can you with any colour of argument infer that any man must commit sin at all no god forbid we should thus speak no necessity of sinning was laid upon them the grace of god was surely sufficient for them and it is sufficient for us at this day with the temptation which fell on them there was a way to escape as there is to every soul of man in every temptation so that whosoever is tempted to any sin need not yield for no man is tempted above that he is able to bear 1 cor 1013 but st paul besought the lord thrice and yet he could not escape from his temptation let us consider his own words literally translated there was given to me a thorn to the flesh an angel or messenger of satan to buffet me touching this i besought the lord thrice that it or he might depart from me and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore will i rather glory in these my weaknesses that the strength of christ may rest upon me therefore i take pleasure in weaknesses  for when i am weak then am i strong 2 cor 12710 as this scripture is one of the strongholds of the patrons of sin it may be proper to weigh it thoroughly let it be observed then first it does by no means appear that this thorn whatsoever it was occasioned st paul to commit sin much less laid him under any necessity of doing so therefore from hence it can never be proved that any christian must commit sin secondly the ancient fathers inform us it was bodily pain a violent headache saith tertullian de pudic to which both chrysostom and st jerome agree st cyprian de mortalitate expresses it a little more generally in those terms many and grievous torments of the flesh and of the body carnis et corporis multa ac gravia tormenta thirdly to this exactly agree the apostles own words a thorn to the flesh to smite beat or buffet me my strength is made perfect in weakness  which same word occurs no less than four times in these two verses only but fourthly whatsoever it was it could not be either inward or outward sin it could no more be inward stirrings than outward expressions of pride anger or lust this is manifest beyond all possible exception from the words that immediately follow most gladly will i glory in these my weaknesses that the strength of christ may rest upon me 2 cor 129 what did he glory in pride in anger in lust was it through these   weaknesses that the strength of christ rested upon him he goes on therefore i take pleasure in weaknesses for when i am weak then am i strong 2 cor 1210 that is when i am weak in body then am i strong in spirit but will any man dare to say when i am weak by pride or lust then am i strong in spirit i call you all to record this day who find the strength of christ resting upon you can you glory in anger or pride or lust can you take pleasure in these infirmities do these weaknesses make you strong would you not leap into hell were it possible to escape them even by yourselves then judge whether the apostle could glory and take pleasure in them let it be lastly observed that this thorn was given to st paul above fourteen years before he wrote this epistle 2 cor 122 which itself was wrote several years before he finished his course see acts 2024 2 tim 47 so that he had after this a long course to run many battles to fight many victories to gain and great increase to receive in all the gifts of god and the knowledge of jesus christ therefore from any spiritual weakness if such it had been which he at that time felt we could by no means infer that he was never made strong that paul the aged the father in christ still laboured under the same weaknesses that he was in no higher state till the day of his death from all which it appears that this instance of st paul is quite foreign to the question and does in no wise clash with the assertion of st john he that is born of god sinneth not 1 john 518  but does not st james directly contradict this his words are in many things we offend all jas 32 and is not offending the same as committing sin in this place i allow it is i allow the persons here spoken of did commit sin yea that they all committed many sins but who are the persons here spoken of why those many masters or teachers whom god had not sent probably the same vain men who taught that faith without works which is so sharply reproved in the preceding chapter jas 2 not the apostle himself nor any real christian that in the word we used by a figure of speech common in all other as well as the inspired writings the apostle could not possibly include himself or any other true believer appears evidently first from the same word in the ninth verse  therewith saith he bless we god and therewith curse we men out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing jas 39 true but not out of the mouth of the apostle nor of anyone who is in christ a new creature 2 cor 517 secondly from the verse immediately preceding the text and manifestly connected with it my brethren be not many masters or teachers knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation for in many things we offend all jas 31 we who not the apostles not true believers but they who know they should receive the greater condemnation because of those many offences but this could not be spoke of the apostle himself or of any who trod in his steps seeing there is no condemnation to them who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit rom 82 nay thirdly the very verse itself proves that we offend all cannot be spoken either of all men or of all christians for in it there immediately follows the mention of a man who offends not as the we first mentioned did from whom therefore he is professedly contradistinguished and pronounced a perfect man so clearly does st james explain himself and fix the meaning of his own words yet lest any one should still remain in doubt st john writing many years after st james puts the matter entirely out of dispute by the express declarations above recited but here a fresh difficulty may arise how shall we reconcile st john with himself in one place he declares whosoever is born of god doth not commit sin 1 john 39 and again  we know that he which is born of god sinneth not 1 john 518 and yet in another he saith if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us 1 john 18 and again  if we say that we have not sinned we make him a liar and his word is not in us 1 john 110 as great a difficulty as this may at first appear it vanishes away if we observe first that the tenth verse fixes the sense of the eighth if we say we have no sin in the former being explained by if we say we have not sinned in the latter verse 1 john 110 8 secondly that the point under present consideration is not whether we have or have not sinned heretofore and neither of these verses asserts that we do sin or commit sin now thirdly that the ninth verse explains both the eighth and tenth if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness as if he had said i have before affirmed the blood of jesus christ cleanseth us from all sin but let no man say i need it not i have no sin to be cleansed from if we say that we have no sin that we have not sinned we deceive ourselves and make god a liar but if we confess our sins he is faithful and just not only to forgive our sins but also to cleanse us from all unrighteousness 1 john 1810 that we may go and sin no more john 811   st john therefore is well consistent with himself as well as with the other holy writers as will yet more evidently appear if we place all his assertions touching this matter in one view he declares first the blood of jesus christ cleanseth us from all sin secondly no man can say i have not sinned i have no sin to be cleansed from thirdly but god is ready both to forgive our past sins and to save us from them for the time to come 1 john 1710 fourthly these things i write unto you saith the apostle that ye may not sin but if any man should sin or have sinned as the word might be rendered he need not continue in sin seeing we have an advocate with the father jesus christ the righteous 1 john 212 thus far all is clear but lest any doubt should remain in a point of so vast importance the apostle resumes this subject in the third chapter and largely explains his own meaning little children saith he let no man deceive you as though i had given any encouragement to those that continue in sin he that doeth righteousness is righteous even as he is righteous he that committeth sin is of the devil for the devil sinneth from the beginning for this purpose the son of god was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil whosoever is born of god doth not commit sin for his seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he is born of god in this the children of god are manifest and the children of the devil 1 john 3710 here the point which till then might possibly have admitted of some doubt in weak minds is purposely settled by the last of the inspired writers and decided in the clearest manner in conformity therefore both to the doctrine of st john and to the whole tenor of the new testament we fix this conclusion  a christian is so far perfect as not to commit sin this is the glorious privilege of every christian yea though he be but a babe in christ but it is only of those who are strong in the lord and have overcome the wicked one or rather of those who have known him that is from the beginning 1 john 213 14 that it can be affirmed they are in such a sense perfect as secondly to be freed from evil thoughts and evil tempers first from evil or sinful thoughts but here let it be observed that thoughts concerning evil are not always evil thoughts that a thought concerning sin and a sinful thought are widely different a man for instance may think of a murder which another has committed and yet this is no evil or sinful thought so our blessed lord himself doubtless thought of or understood the thing spoken by the devil when he said all these things will i give thee if thou wilt fall down and worship me matt 49 yet had he no evil or sinful thought nor indeed was capable of having any and even hence it follows that neither have real christians for every one that is perfect is as his master luke 640 therefore if he was free from evil or sinful thoughts so are they likewise and indeed whence should evil thoughts proceed in the servant who is as his master out of the heart of man if at all proceed evil thoughts mark 721 if therefore his heart be no longer evil then evil thoughts can no longer proceed out of it if the tree were corrupt so would be the fruit but the tree is good the fruit therefore is good also matt 2233 our lord himself bearing witness every good tree bringeth forth good fruit a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit as a corrupt tree cannot bring forth good fruit matt 717 18 the same happy privilege of real christians st paul asserts from his own experience the weapons of our warfare saith he are not carnal but mighty through god to the pulling down of strongholds casting down imaginations or reasonings rather for so the word logimous signifies all the reasonings of pride and unbelief against the declarations promises or gifts of god and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of god and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of christ 2 cor 104 c and as christians indeed are freed from evil thoughts so are they secondly from evil tempers this is evident from the abovementioned declaration of our lord himself the disciple is not above his master but every one that is perfect shall be as his master luke 640 he had been delivering just before some of the sublimest doctrines of christianity and some of the most grievous to flesh and blood i say unto you love your enemies do good to them which hate you  and unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other luke 629 now these he well knew the world would not receive and therefore immediately adds can the blind lead the blind will they not both fall into the ditch luke 639 as if he had said do not confer with flesh and blood touching these things  with men void of spiritual discernment the eyes of whose understanding god hath not opened  lest they and you perish together in the next verse he removes the two grand objections   with which these wise fools meet us at every turn these things are too grievous to be borne or they are too high to be attained matt 234 saying the disciple is not above his master therefore if i have suffered be content to tread in my steps and doubt ye not then but i will fulfill my word for every one that is perfect shall be as his master luke 640 but his master was free from all sinful tempers so therefore is his disciple even every real christian every one of these can say with st paul i am crucified with christ nevertheless i live yet not i but christ liveth in me gal 220  words that manifestly describe a deliverance from inward as well as from outward sin this is expressed both negatively i live not my evil nature the body of sin is destroyed and positively christ liveth in me and therefore all that is holy and just and good indeed both these christ liveth in me and i live not are inseparably connected for what communion hath light with darkness or christ with belial 2 cor 615 he therefore who liveth in true believers hath purified their hearts by faith acts 159 insomuch that every one that hath christ in him the hope of glory col 127 purifieth himself even as he is pure 1 john 33 he is purified from pride for christ was lowly of heart matt 1129 he is pure from selfwill or desire for christ desired only to do the will of his father and to finish his work john 434 530 and he is pure from anger in the common sense of the word for christ was meek and gentle patient and longsuffering i say in the common sense of the word for all anger is not evil we read of our lord himself mark 35 that he once looked round with anger but with what kind of anger the next word shows syllypoumenos being at the same time grieved for the hardness of their hearts mark 36 so then he was angry at the sin and in the same moment grieved for the sinners angry or displeased at the offence but sorry for the offenders with anger yea hatred he looked upon the thing with grief and love upon the persons go thou that art perfect and do likewise be thus angry and thou sinnest not see eph 426 feeling a displacency at every offence against god but only love and tender compassion to the offender thus doth jesus save his people from their sins matt 121 and not only from outward sins but also from the sins of their hearts from evil thoughts and from evil tempers  true say some we shall thus be saved from our sins but not till death not in this world but how are we to reconcile this with the express words of st john  herein is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world the apostle here beyond all contradiction speaks of himself and other living christians of whom as though he had foreseen this very evasion and set himself to overturn it from the foundation he flatly affirms that not only at or after death but in this world they are as their master 1 john 417 exactly agreeable to this are his words in the first chapter of this epistle 1 john 15 c god is light and in him is no darkness at all if we walk in the light  we have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus christ his son cleanseth us from all sin and again if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness 1 john 19 now it is evident the apostle here also speaks of a deliverance wrought in this world for he saith not the blood of christ will cleanse at the hour of death or in the day of judgment but it cleanseth at the time present us living christians from all sin and it is equally evident that if any sin remain we are not cleansed from all sin if any unrighteousness remain in the soul it is not cleansed from all unrighteousness neither let any sinner against his own soul say that this relates to justification only or the cleansing us from the guilt of sin first because this is confounding together what the apostle clearly distinguishes who mentions first to forgive us our sins and then to cleanse us from all unrighteousness secondly because this is asserting justification by works in the strongest sense possible it is making all inward as well as outward holiness necessarily previous to justification for if the cleansing here spoken of is no other than the cleansing us from the guilt of sin then we are not cleansed from guilt that is are not justified unless on condition of walking in the light as he is in the light 1 john 17 it remains then that christians are saved in this world from all sin from all unrighteousness that they are now in such a sense perfect as not to commit sin and to be freed from evil thoughts and evil tempers  thus hath the lord fulfilled the things he spake by his holy prophets which have been since the world began  by moses in particular saying deut 306 i will circumcise thine heart and the heart of thy seed to love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul by david crying   out create in me a clean heart and renew a right spirit within me ps 5110  and most remarkably by ezekiel in those words then will i sprinkle clean water upon you and ye shall be clean from all your filthiness and from all your idols will i cleanse you a new heart also will i give you and a new spirit will i put within you  and cause you to walk in my statutes and ye shall keep my judgments and do them  ye shall be my people and i will be your god i will also save you from all your uncleannesses  thus saith the lord your god in the day that i shall have cleansed you from all your iniquities  the heathen shall know that i the lord build the ruined places  i the lord have spoken it and i will do it ezek 3625 c 30 having therefore these promises dearly beloved both in the law and in the prophets and having the prophetic word confirmed unto us in the gospel by our blessed lord and his apostles let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of flesh and spirit perfecting holiness in the fear of god 2 cor 71 let us fear lest so many promises being made us of entering into his rest which he that hath entered into has ceased from his own works any of us should come short of it heb 41 this one thing let us do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto

height now let me into nothing fall be less than nothing in thy sight and feel that christ is all in all   sermon 41 text from the 1872 edition wandering thoughts bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of christ 2 cor 55 but will god so bring every thought into captivity to the obedience of christ that no wandering thought will find a place in the mind even while we remain in the body so some have vehemently maintained yea have affirmed that none are perfected in love unless they are so far perfected in understanding that all wandering thoughts are done away unless not only every affection and temper be holy and just and good but every individual thought which arises in the mind be wise and regular this is a question of no small importance for how many of those who fear god yea and love him perhaps with all their heart have been greatly distressed on this account how many by not understanding it right have not only been distressed but greatly hurt in their souls  cast into unprofitable yea mischievous reasonings such as slackened their motion towards god and weakened them in running the race set before them nay many through misapprehensions of this very thing have cast away the precious gift of god they have been induced first to doubt of and then to deny the work god had wrought in their souls and hereby have grieved the spirit of god till he withdrew and left them in utter darkness how is it then that amidst the abundance of books which have been lately published almost on all subjects we should have none upon wandering thoughts at least none that will at all satisfy a calm and serious mind in order to do this in some degree i purpose to inquire i what are the several sorts of wandering thoughts ii what are the general occasions of them iii which of them are sinful and which not iv which of them we may expect and pray to be delivered from i 1 i purpose to inquire first what are the several sorts of wandering thoughts the particular sorts are innumerable but in general they are of two sorts thoughts that wander from god and thoughts that wander from the particular point we have in hand with regard to the former all our thoughts are naturally of this kind for they are continually wandering from god we think nothing about him god is not in all our thoughts we are one and all as the apostle observes without god in the world we think of what we love but we do not love god therefore we think not of him or if we are now and then constrained to think of him for a time yet as we have not pleasure therein nay rather as these thoughts are not only insipid but distasteful and irksome to us we drive them out as soon as we can and return to what we love to think of so that the world and the things of the world  what we shall eat what we shall drink what we shall put on  what we shall see what we shall hear what we shall gain  how we shall please our senses or our imagination  takes up all our time and engrosses all our thought so long therefore as we love the world that is so long as we are in our natural state all our thoughts from morning to evening and from evening to morning are no other than wandering thoughts but many times we are not only without god in the world but also fighting against him as there is in every man by nature a carnal mind which is enmity against god no wonder therefore that men abound with unbelieving thoughts either saying in their hearts there is no god or questioning if not denying his power or wisdom his mercy or justice or holiness no wonder that they so often doubt of his providence at least of its extending to all events or that even though they allow it they still entertain murmuring or repining thoughts nearly related to these and frequently   connected with them are proud and vain imaginations again sometimes they are taken up with angry malicious or revengeful thoughts at other times with airy scenes of pleasure whether of sense or imagination whereby the earthly sensual mind becomes more earthy and sensual still now by all these they make flat war with god these are wandering thoughts of the highest kind 4 widely different from these are the other sort of wandering thoughts in which the heart does not wander from god but the understanding wanders from the particular point it had then in view for instance i sit down to consider those words in the verse preceding the text the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through god i think this ought to be the case with all that are called christians but how far is it otherwise look round into almost every part of what is termed the christian world what manner of weapons are these using in what kind of warfare are they engaged while men like fiends each other tear in all the hellish rage of war see how these christians love one another wherein are they preferable to turks and pagans what abomination can be found among mahometans or heathens which is not found among christians also and thus my mind runs off before i am aware from one circumstance to another now all these are in some sense wandering thoughts for although they do not wander from god much less fight against him yet they do wander from the particular point i had in view ii such is the nature such are the sorts to speak rather usefully than philosophically of wandering thoughts but what are the general occasions of them this we are in the second place to consider and it is easy to observe that the occasion of the former sort of thoughts which oppose or wander from god are in general sinful tempers for instance why is not god in all the thoughts in any of the thoughts of a natural man for a plain reason be he rich or poor learned or unlearned he is an atheist though not vulgarly so called he neither knows nor loves god why are his thoughts continually wandering after the world because he is an idolater he does not indeed worship an image or bow down to the stock of a tree yet is he sunk into equally damnable idolatry he loves that is worships the world he seeks happiness in the things that are seen in the pleasures that perish in the using why is it that his thoughts are perpetually wandering from the very end of his being the knowledge of god in christ because he is an unbeliever because he has no faith or at least no more than a devil so all these wandering thoughts easily and naturally spring from that evil root of unbelief  the case is the same in other instances pride anger revenge vanity lust covetousness every one of them occasions thoughts suitable to its own nature and so does every sinful temper of which the human mind is capable the particulars it is hardly possible nor is it needful to enumerate it suffices to observe that as many evil tempers as find a place in any soul so many ways that soul will depart from god by the worst kind of wandering thoughts the occasions of the latter kind of wandering thoughts are exceeding various multitudes of them are occasioned by the natural union between the soul and body how immediately and how deeply is the understanding affected by a diseased body let but the blood move irregularly in the brain and all regular thinking is at an end raging madness ensues and then farewell to all evenness of thought yea let only the spirits be hurried or agitated to a certain degree and a temporary madness a delirium prevents all settled thought and is not the same irregularity of thought in a measure occasioned by every nervous disorder so does the corruptible body press down the soul and cause it to muse about many things  but does it only cause this in the time of sickness or preternatural disorder nay but more or less at all times even in a state of perfect health let a man be ever so healthy he will be more or less delirious every fourandtwenty hours for does he not sleep and while he sleeps is he not liable to dream and who then is master of his own thoughts or able to preserve the order and consistency of them who can then keep them fixed to any one point or prevent their wandering from pole to pole   but suppose we are awake are we always so awake that we can steadily govern our thoughts are we not unavoidably exposed to contrary extremes by the very nature of this machine the body sometimes we are too heavy too dull and languid to pursue any chain of thought sometimes on the other hand we are too lively the imagination without leave starts to and fro and carries us away hither and thither whether we will or no and all this from the merely natural motion of the spirits or vibration of the nerves farther how many wanderings of thought may arise from those various associations of our ideas which are made entirely without our knowledge and independently on our choice how these connexions are formed we cannot tell but they are formed in a thousand different manners nor is it in the power of the wisest or holiest of men to break those associations or prevent what is the necessary consequences of them and matter of daily observation let the fire but touch one end of the train and it immediately runs on to the other once more let us fix our attention as studiously as we are able on any subject yet let either pleasure or pain arise especially if it be intense and it will demand our immediate attention and attach our thought to itself it will interrupt the steadiest contemplation and divert the mind from its favourite subject these occasions of wandering thoughts lie within are wrought into our very nature but they will likewise naturally and necessarily arise from the various impulse of outward objects whatever strikes upon the organ of sense the eye or ear will raise a perception in the mind and accordingly whatever we see or hear will break in upon our former train of thought every man therefore that does anything in our sight or speaks anything in our hearing occasions our mind to wander more or less from the point it was thinking of before and there is no question but those evil spirits who are continually seeking whom they may devour make use of all the foregoing occasions to hurry and distract our minds sometimes by one sometimes by another of these means they will harass and perplex us and so far as god permits interrupt our thoughts particularly when they are engaged on the best subjects nor is this at all strange they will understand the very springs of thought and know on which of the bodily organs the imagination the understanding and every other faculty of the mind more immediately depends and hereby they know how by affecting those organs to affect the operations dependent on them add to this that they can inject a thousand thoughts without any of the preceding means it being as natural for spirit to act upon spirit as for matter to act upon matter these things being considered we cannot admire that our thought so often wanders from any point which we have in view iii 1 what kind of wandering thoughts are sinful and what not is the third thing to be inquired into and first all those thoughts which wander from god which leave him no room in our minds are undoubtedly sinful for all these imply practical atheism and by these we are without god in the world and so much more are all those which are contrary to god which imply opposition or enmity to him such are all murmuring discontented thoughts which say in effect we will not have thee to rule over us  all unbelieving thoughts whether with regard to his being his attributes or his providence i mean his particular providence over all things as well as all persons in the universe that without which not a sparrow falls to the ground by which the hairs of our head are all numbered for as to a general providence vulgarly so called contradistinguished from a particular it is only a decent wellsounding word which means just nothing again all thoughts which spring from sinful tempers are undoubtedly sinful such for instance are those that spring from a revengeful temper from pride or lust or vanity an evil tree cannot bring forth good fruit therefore if the tree be evil so must the fruit be also and so must those be which either produce or feed any sinful temper those which either give rise to pride or vanity to anger or love of the world or confirm and increase these or any other unholy temper passion or affection for not only whatever flows from evil is evil but also whatever leads to it whatever tends to alienate the soul from god and to make or keep it earthly sensual and devilish   hence even those thoughts which are occasioned by weakness or disease by the natural mechanism of the body or by the laws of vital union however innocent they may be in themselves do nevertheless become sinful when they either produce or cherish and increase in us any sinful temper suppose the desire of the flesh the desire of the eye or the pride of life in like manner the wandering thoughts which are occasioned by the words or actions of other men if they cause or feed any wrong disposition then commence sinful and the same we may observe of those which are suggested or injected by the devil when they minister to any earthly or devilish temper which they do whenever we give place to them and thereby make them our own then they are equally sinful with the tempers to which they minister  but abstracting from these cases wandering thoughts in the latter sense of the word that is thoughts wherein our understanding wanders from the point it has in view are no more sinful than the motion of the blood in our veins or of the spirits in our brain if they arise from an infirm constitution or from some accidental weakness or distemper they are as innocent as it is to have a weak constitution or a distempered body and surely no one doubts but a bad state of nerves a fever of any kind and either a transient or a lasting delirium may consist with perfect innocence and if they should arise in a soul which is united to a healthful body either from the natural union between the body and soul or from any of ten thousand changes which may occur in those organs of the body that minister to thought  in any of these cases they are as perfectly innocent as the causes from which they spring and so they are when they spring from the casual involuntary associations of our ideas if our thoughts wander from the point we had in view by means of other men variously affecting our senses they are equally innocent still for it is no more a sin to understand what i see and hear and in many cases cannot help seeing hearing and understanding than it is to have eyes and ears but if the devil injects wandering thoughts are not those thoughts evil they are troublesome and in that sense evil but they are not sinful i do not know that he spoke to our lord with an audible voice perhaps he spoke to his heart only when he said all these things will i give thee if thou wilt fall down and worship me but whether he spoke inwardly or outwardly our lord doubtless understood what he said he had therefore a thought correspondent to those words but was it a sinful thought we know it was not in him was no sin either in action or word or thought nor is there any sin in a thousand thoughts of the same kind which satan may inject into any of our lords followers  it follows that none of these wandering thoughts whatever unwary persons have affirmed thereby grieving whom the lord had not grieved are inconsistent with perfect love indeed if they were then not only sharp pain but sleep itself would be inconsistent with it  sharp pain for whenever this supervenes whatever we were before thinking of it will interrupt our thinking and of course draw our thoughts into another channel  yea and sleep itself as it is a state of insensibility and stupidity and such as is generally mixed with thoughts wandering over the earth loose wild and incoherent yet certainly these are consistent with perfect love so then are all wandering thoughts of this kind iv 1 from what has been observed it is easy to give a clear answer to the last question  what kind of wandering thoughts we may expect and pray to be delivered from from the former sort of wandering thoughts  those wherein the heart wanders from god from all that are contrary to his will or that leave us without god in the world every one that is perfected in love is unquestionably delivered this deliverance therefore we may expect this we may we ought to pray for wandering thoughts of this kind imply unbelief if not enmity against god but both of these he will destroy will bring utterly to an end and indeed from all sinful wandering thoughts we shall be absolutely delivered all that are perfected in love are delivered from these else they were not saved from sin men and devils will tempt them all manner of ways but they cannot prevail over them  2 with regard to the latter sort of wandering thoughts the case is widely different till the cause is removed we cannot in reason expect the effect should cease but the causes or occasions of these will remain as long as we remain in the body so long therefore we have all reason to believe the effects will remain also   to be more particular suppose a soul however holy to dwell in a distempered body suppose the brain be so thoroughly disordered as that raging madness follows will not all the thoughts be wild and unconnected as long as that disorder continues suppose a fever occasions that temporary madness which we term a delirium can there be any just connexion of thought till that delirium is removed yea suppose what is called a nervous disorder to rise to so high a degree as to occasion at least a partial madness will there not be a thousand wandering thoughts and must not these irregular thoughts continue as long as the disorder which occasions them will not the case be the same with regard to those thoughts that necessarily arise from violent pain they will more or less continue while that pain continues by the inviolable order of nature this order likewise will obtain where the thoughts are disturbed broken or interrupted by any defect of the apprehension judgement or imagination flowing from the natural constitution of the body and how many interruptions may spring from the unaccountable and involuntary association of our ideas now all these are directly or indirectly caused by the corruptible body pressing down the mind nor therefore can we expect them to be removed till this corruptible shall put on incorruption and then only when we lie down in the dust shall we be delivered from those wandering thoughts which are occasioned by what we see and hear among those by whom we are now surrounded to avoid these we must go out of the world for as long as we remain therein as long as there are men and women round about us and we have eyes to see and ears to hear the things which we daily see and hear will certainly affect our mind and will more or less break in upon and interrupt our preceding thoughts  and as long as evil spirits roam to and fro in a miserable disordered world so long they will assault whether they can prevail or no every inhabitant of flesh and blood they will trouble even those whom they cannot destroy they will attack if they cannot conquer and from these attacks of our restless unwearied enemies we must not look for an entire deliverance till we are lodged where the wicked cease from troubling and where the weary are at rest to sum up the whole to expect deliverance from those wandering thoughts which are occasioned by evil spirits is to expect that the devil should die or fall asleep or at least should no more go about as a roaring lion to expect deliverance from those which are occasioned by other men is to expect either that men should cease from the earth or that we should be absolutely secluded from them and have no intercourse with them or that having eyes we should see neither hear with our ears but be as senseless as stocks or stones and to pray for deliverance from those which are occasioned by the body is in effect to pray that we may leave the body otherwise it is praying for impossibilities and absurdities praying that god would reconcile contradictions by continuing our union with a corruptible body without the natural necessary consequences of that union it is as if we should pray to be angels and men mortal and immortal at the same time nay  but when that which is immortal is come mortality is done away rather let us pray both with the spirit and with the understanding that all these things may work together for our good that we may suffer all the infirmities of our nature all the interruptions of men all the assaults and suggestions of evil spirits and in all be more than conquerors let us pray that we may be delivered from all sin that both the root and branch may be destroyed that we may be cleansed from all pollution of flesh and spirit from every evil temper and word and work that we may love the lord our god with all our heart with all our mind with all our soul and with all our strength that all the fruit of the spirit may be found in us  not only love joy peace but also longsuffering gentleness goodness fidelity meekness temperance pray that all these things may flourish and abound may increase in you more and more till an abundant entrance be ministered unto you into the everlasting kingdom of our lord jesus christ   sermon 42 text from the 1872 edition satans devices we are not ignorant of his devices 2 cor 211 the devices whereby the subtle god of this world labours to destroy the children of god  or at least to torment whom he cannot destroy to perplex and hinder them in running the race which is set before them  are numberless as the stars of heaven or the sand upon the seashore but it is of one of them only that i now propose to speak although exerted in various ways whereby he endeavours to divide the gospel against itself and by one part of it to overthrow the other the inward kingdom of heaven which is set up in the heart of all that repent and believe the gospel is no other than righteousness and peace and joy in the holy ghost every babe in christ knows we are made partakers of these the very hour that we believe in jesus but these are only the firstfruits of his spirit the harvest is not yet although these blessings are inconceivably great yet we trust to see greater than these we trust to love the lord our god not only as we do now with a weak though sincere affection but with all our heart with all our mind with all our soul and with all our strength we look for power to rejoice evermore to pray without ceasing and in everything to give thanks knowing this is the will of god in christ jesus concerning us we expect to be made perfect in love in that love which casts out all painful fear and all desire but that of glorifying him we love and of loving and serving him more and more we look for such an increase in the experimental knowledge and love of god our saviour as will enable us always to walk in the light as he is in the light we believe the whole mind will be in us which was also in christ jesus that we shall love every man so as to be ready to lay down our life for his sake so as by this love to be freed from anger and pride and from every unkind affection we expect to be cleansed from all our idols from all filthiness whether of flesh or spirit to be saved from all our uncleannesses inward or outward to be purified as he is pure we trust in his promise who cannot lie that the time will surely come when in every word and work we shall do his blessed will on earth as it is done in heaven when all our conversation shall be seasoned with salt all meet to minister grace to the hearers when whether we eat or drink or whatever we do it shall be done to the glory of god when all our words and deeds shall be in the name of the lord jesus giving thanks unto god even the father through him now this is the grand device of satan to destroy the first work of god in the soul or at least to hinder its increase by our expectation of that greater work it is therefore my present design first to point out the several ways whereby he endeavours this and secondly to observe how we may retort these fiery darts of the wicked one how we may rise the higher by what he intends for an occasion of our falling  i 1 i am first to point out the several ways whereby satan endeavours to destroy the first work of god in the soul or at least to hinder its increase by our expectation of that greater work and 1 he endeavours to damp our joy in the lord by the consideration of our own vileness sinfulness unworthiness added to this that there must be a far greater change than is yet or we cannot see the lord if we knew we must remain as we are even to the day of our death we might possibly draw a kind of comfort poor as it was from that necessity but as we know we need not remain in this state as we are assured there is a greater change to come and that unless sin be all done away in this life we cannot see god in glory  that subtle adversary often damps the joy we should otherwise feel in what we have already attained by a perverse representation of what we have not attained and the absolute necessity of attaining it so that we cannot rejoice in what we have because there is more which we have not we cannot rightly taste the goodness of god who hath done so great things for us because there are so much greater things which as yet he hath not done likewise the deeper conviction god works in us of our present unholiness and the more vehement desire we feel in our   heart of the entire holiness he hath promised the more are we tempted to think lightly of the present gifts of god and to undervalue what we have already received because of what we have not received if he can prevail thus far if he can damp our joy he will soon attack our peace also he will suggest are you fit to see god he is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity how then can you flatter yourself so as to imagine he beholds you with approbation god is holy you are unholy what communion hath light with darkness how is it possible that you unclean as you are should be in a state of acceptance with god you see indeed the mark the prize of your high calling but do you not see it is afar off how can you presume then to think that all your sins are already blotted out how can this be until you are brought nearer to god until you bear more resemblance to him thus will he endeavour not only to shake your peace but even to overturn the very foundation of it to bring you back by insensible degrees to the point from whence you set out first even to seek for justification by works or by your own righteousness  to make something in you the ground of your acceptance or at least necessarily previous to it or if we hold fast other foundation can no man lay than that which is laid even jesus christ and i am justified freely by gods grace through the redemption which is in jesus yet he will not cease to urge but the tree is known by its fruits and have you the fruits of justification is that mind in you which was in christ jesus are you dead unto sin and alive unto righteousness are you made conformable to the death of christ and do you know the power of his resurrection and then comparing the small fruits we feel in our souls with the fullness of the promises we shall be ready to conclude surely god hath not said that my sins are forgiven me surely i have not received the remission of my sins for what lot have i among them that are sanctified more especially in the time of sickness and pain he will press this with all his might is it not the word of him that cannot lie without holiness no man shall see the lord but you are not holy you know it well you know holiness is the full image of god and how far is this above out of your sight you cannot attain unto it therefore all your labour has been in vain all these things you have suffered in vain you have spent your strength for nought you are yet in your sins and must therefore perish at the last and thus if your eye be not steadily fixed on him who hath borne all your sins he will bring you again under that fear of death whereby you was so long subject unto bondage and by this means impair if not wholly destroy your peace as well as joy in the lord but his masterpiece of subtlety is still behind not content to strike at your peace and joy he will carry his attempts farther yet he will level his assault against your righteousness also he will endeavour to shake yea if it be possible to destroy the holiness you have already received by your very expectation of receiving more of attaining all the image of god the manner wherein he attempts this may partly appear from what has been already observed for first by striking at our joy in the lord he strikes likewise at our holiness seeing joy in the holy ghost is a precious means of promoting every holy temper a choice instrument of god whereby he carries on much of his work in a believing soul and it is a considerable help not only to inward but also to outward holiness it strengthens our hands to go on in the work of faith and in the labour of love manfully to fight the good fight of faith and to lay hold on eternal life it is peculiarly designed of god to be a balance both against inward and outward sufferings to lift up the hands that hang down and confirm the feeble knees consequently whatever damps our joy in the lord proportionably obstructs our holiness and therefore so far as satan shakes our joy he hinders our holiness also  the same effect will ensue if he can by any means either destroy or shake our peace for the peace of god is another precious means of advancing the image of god in us there is scarce a greater help to holiness than this a continual tranquility of spirit the evenness of a mind stayed upon god a calm repose in the blood of jesus and without this it is scarce possible to grow in grace and in the vital knowledge of our lord jesus christ for all fear unless the tender filial fear freezes and benumbs the soul it binds up all the springs of spiritual life and stops all motion of the heart toward god and doubt as it were bemires the soul so that it sticks fast in the deep clay therefore in the same proportion as either of these prevail our growth in holiness is hindered   at the same time that our wise adversary endeavours to make our conviction of the necessity of perfect love an occasion of shaking our peace by doubts and fears he endeavours to weaken if not destroy our faith indeed these are inseparably connected so that they must stand or fall together so long as faith subsists we remain in peace our heart stands fast while it believes in the lord but if we let go our faith our filial confidence in a loving pardoning god our peace is at an end the very foundation on which it stood being overthrown and this is the only foundation of holiness as well as of peace consequently whatever strikes at this strikes at the very root of all holiness for without this faith without an abiding sense that christ loved me and gave himself for me without a continuing conviction that god for christs sake is merciful to me a sinner it is impossible that i should love god we love him because he first loved us and in proportion to the strength and clearness of our conviction that he hath loved us and accepted us in his son and unless we love god it is not possible that we should love our neighbour as ourselves nor consequently that we should have any right affections either toward god or toward man it evidently follows that whatever weakens our faith must in the same degree obstruct our holiness and this is not only the most effectual but also the most compendious way of destroying all holiness seeing it does not affect any one christian temper any single grace or fruit of the spirit but so far as it succeeds tears up the very root of the whole work of god  no marvel therefore that the ruler of the darkness of this world should here put forth all his strength and so we find by experience for it is far easier to conceive than it is to express the unspeakable violence wherewith this temptation is frequently urged on them who hunger and thirst after righteousness when they see in a strong and clear light on the one hand the desperate wickedness of their own hearts  on the other hand the unspotted holiness to which they are called in christ jesus on the one hand the depth of their own corruption of their total alienation from god  on the other the height of the glory of god that image of the holy one wherein they are to be renewed there is many times no spirit left in them they could almost cry out with god this is impossible they are ready to give up both faith and hope to cast away that very confidence whereby they are to overcome all things and do all things through christ strengthening them whereby after they have done the will of god they are to receive the promise and if they hold fast the beginning of their confidence steadfast unto the end they shall undoubtedly receive the promise of god reaching through both time and eternity but here is another snare laid for our feet while we earnestly pant for that part of the promise which is to be accomplished here for the glorious liberty of the children of god we may be led unawares from the consideration of the glory which shall hereafter be revealed our eye may be insensibly turned aside from that crown which the righteous judge hath promised to give at that day to all that love his appearing and we may be drawn away from the view of that incorruptible inheritance which is reserved in heaven for us but this also would be a loss to our souls and an obstruction to our holiness for to walk in the continual sight of our goal is a needful help in our running the race that is set before us this it was the having respect unto the recompense of reward which of old time encouraged moses rather to suffer affliction with the people of god than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season esteeming the reproach of christ greater riches than the treasures of egypt nay it is expressly said of a greater than he that for the joy that was set before him he endured the cross and despised the shame till he sat down at the right hand of the throne of god whence we may easily infer how much more needful for us is the view of that joy set before us that we may endure whatever cross the wisdom of god lays upon us and press on through holiness to glory but while we are reaching to this as well as to that glorious liberty which is preparatory to it we may be in danger of falling into another snare of the devil whereby he labours to entangle the children of god we may take too much thought for tomorrow so as to neglect the improvement of today we may so expect perfect love as not to use that which is already shed abroad in our hearts there have not been wanting instances of those who have greatly suffered hereby they were so taken up with what they were to receive hereafter as utterly to neglect what they had already received in expectation of having five talents more they buried their one talent in the earth at least they did not improve it as they might have done to the glory of god and the good of their own souls thus does the subtle adversary of god and man endeavour to make void the counsel of god by dividing the gospel against itself and making one part of it overthrow the other while the first work   of god in the soul is destroyed by the expectation of his perfect work we have seen several of the ways wherein he attempts this by cutting off as it were the springs of holiness but this he likewise does more directly by making that blessed hope an occasion of unholy tempers thus whenever our heart is eagerly athirst for all the great and precious promises when we pant after the fullness of god as the hart after the waterbrook when our soul breaketh out in fervent desire why are his chariotwheels so long acoming  he will not neglect the opportunity of tempting us to murmur against god he will use all his wisdom and all his strength if haply in an unguarded hour we may be influenced to repine at our lord for thus delaying his coming at least he will labour to excite some degree of fretfulness or impatience and perhaps of envy at those whom we believe to have already attained the prize of our high calling he well knows that by giving way to any of these tempers we are pulling down the very thing we would build up by thus following after perfect holiness we become more unholy than before yea there is great danger that our last state should be worse than the first like them of whom the apostle speaks in those dreadful words it had been better they had never known the way of righteousness than after they had known it to turn back from the holy commandment delivered to them and from hence he hopes to reap another advantage even to bring up an evil report of the good way he is sensible how few are able to distinguish and too many are not willing so to do between the accidental abuse and the natural tendency of a doctrine these therefore will he continually blend together with regard to the doctrine of christian perfection in order to prejudice the minds of unwary men against the glorious promises of god and how frequently how generally i had almost said how universally has he prevailed herein for who is there that observes any of these accidental ill effects of this doctrine and does not immediately conclude this is its natural tendency and does not readily cry out see these are the fruits meaning the natural necessary fruits of such doctrine not so they are fruits which may accidentally spring from the abuse of a great and precious truth but the abuse of this or any other scriptural doctrine does by no means destroy its use neither can the unfaithfulness of man perverting his right way make the promise of god of none effect no let god be true and every man a liar the word of the lord it shall stand faithful is he that hath promised he also will do it let not us then be removed from the hope of the gospel rather let us observe which was the second thing proposed how we may retort these fiery darts of the wicked one how we may rise the higher by what he intends for an occasion of our falling ii 1 and first does satan endeavour to damp your joy in the lord by the consideration of your sinfulness added to this that without entire universal holiness no man can see the lord you may cast back this dart upon his own head while through the grace of god the more you feel of your own vileness the more you rejoice in confident hope that all this shall be done away while you hold fast this hope every evil temper you feel though you hate it with a perfect hatred may be a means not of lessening your humble joy but rather of increasing it this and this may you say shall likewise perish from the presence of the lord like as the wax melteth at the fire so shall this melt away before his face by this means the greater that change is which remains to be wrought in your soul the more may you triumph in the lord and rejoice in the god of your salvation who hath done so great things for you already and will do so much greater things than these 2 secondly the more vehemently he assaults your peace with that suggestion god is holy you are unholy you are immensely distant from that holiness without which you cannot see god how then can you be in the favour of god how can you fancy you are justified  take the more earnest heed to hold fast that not by works of righteousness which i have done i am found in him i am accepted in the beloved not having my own righteousness as the cause either in whole or in part of our justification before god but that which is by faith in christ the righteousness which is of god by faith o bind this about your neck write it upon the table of thy heart wear it as a bracelet upon thy arm as frontlets between thine eyes i am justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in jesus christ value and esteem more and more that precious truth by grace we are saved through faith admire more and more the free grace of god in so loving the world as to give his only son that whosoever believeth on him might not perish but have everlasting life so shall the sense of the sinfulness you feel on the one hand and of the holiness you expect on the other both contribute to establish your peace and to make it flow as a river so shall that peace flow on with an even stream in spite of all those mountains of ungodliness which shall become a plain in the day   when the lord cometh to take full possession of your heart neither will sickness or pain or the approach of death occasion any doubt or fear you know a day an hour a moment with god is as a thousand years he cannot be straitened for time wherein to work whatever remains to be done in your soul and gods time is always the best time therefore be thou careful for nothing only make thy request known unto him and that not with doubt or fear but thanksgiving as being previously assured he cannot withhold from thee any manner of thing that is good thirdly the more you are tempted to give up your shield to cast away your faith your confidence in his love so much the more take heed that you hold fast that whereunto you have attained so much the more labour to stir up the gift of god which is in you never let that slip i have an advocate with the father jesus christ the righteous and the life i now live i live by faith in the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me be this thy glory and crown of rejoicing and see that no one take thy crown hold that fast i know that my redeemer liveth and shall stand at the latter day upon the earth and i now have redemption in his blood even the forgiveness of sins thus being filled with all peace and joy in believing press on in the peace and joy of faith to the renewal of thy whole soul in the image of him that created thee meanwhile cry continually to god that thou mayest see that prize of thy high calling not as satan represents it in a horrid dreadful shape but in its genuine native beauty not as something that must be or thou wilt go to hell but as what may be to lead thee to heaven look upon it as the most desirable gift which is in all the stores of the rich mercies of god beholding it in this true point of light thou wilt hunger after it more and more thy whole soul will be athirst for god and for this glorious conformity to his likeness and having received a good hope of this and strong consolation through grace thou wilt no more be weary or faint in thy mind but wilt follow on till thou attainest  in the same power of faith press on to glory indeed this is the same prospect still god hath joined from the beginning pardon holiness heaven and why should man put them asunder o beware of this let not one link of the golden chain be broken god for christs sake hath forgiven me he is now renewing me in his own image shortly he will make me meet for himself and take me to stand before his face i whom he hath justified through the blood of his son being thoroughly sanctified by his spirit shall quickly ascend to the new jerusalem the city of the living god yet a little while and i shall come to the general assembly and church of the firstborn and to god the judge of all and to jesus the mediator of the new covenant how soon will these shadows flee away and the day of eternity dawn upon me how soon shall i drink of the river of the water of life going out of the throne of god and of the lamb there all his servants shall praise him and shall see his face and his name shall be upon their foreheads and no night shall be there and they have no need of a candle or the light of the sun for the lord god enlighteneth them and they shall reign for ever and ever and if you thus taste of the good word and of the powers of the world to come you will not murmur against god because you are not yet meet for the inheritance of the saints in light instead of repining at your not being wholly delivered you will praise god for thus far delivering you you will magnify god for what he hath done and take it as an earnest of what he will do you will not fret against him because you are not yet renewed but bless him because you shall be and because now is your salvation from all sin nearer than when you first believed instead of uselessly tormenting yourself because the time is not fully come you will calmly and quietly wait for it knowing that it will come and will not tarry you may therefore the more cheerfully endure as yet the burden of sin that still remains in you because it will not always remain yet a little while and it shall be clean gone only tarry thou the lords leisure be strong and he shall comfort thy heart and put thou thy trust in the lord  and if you see any who appear so far as man can judge but god alone searcheth the hearts to be already partakers of their hope already made perfect in love far from envying the grace of god in them let it rejoice and comfort your heart glorify god for their sake if one member is honoured shall not all the members rejoice with it instead of jealousy or evil surmising concerning them praise god for the consolation rejoice in having a fresh proof of the faithfulness of god in fulfilling all his promises and stir yourself up the more to apprehend that for which you also are apprehended of

sugdens sermon 50 the scripture way of salvation ye are saved through faith  ephesians 28 nothing can be more intricate complex and hard to be understood than religion as it has been often described and this is not only true concerning the religion of the heathens even many of the wisest of them but concerning the religion of those also who were in some sense christians yea and men of great name in the christian world men who seemed to be pillars thereof yet how easy to be understood how plain and simple a thing is the genuine religion of jesus christ provided only that we take it in its native form just as it is described in the oracles of god it is exactly suited by the wise creator and governor of the world to the weak understanding and narrow capacity of man in his present state how observable is this both with regard to the end it proposes and the means to attain that end the end is in one word salvation the means to attain it faith it is easily discerned that these two little words i mean faith and salvation include the substance of all the bible the marrow as it were of the whole scripture so much the more should we take all possible care to avoid all mistake concerning them and to form a true and accurate judgement concerning both the one and the other let us then seriously inquire i what is salvation ii what is that faith whereby we are saved and iii how are we saved by it i and first let us inquire what is salvation the salvation which is here spoken of is not what is frequently understood by that word the going to heaven eternal happiness it is not the souls going to paradise termed by our lord abrahams bosom it is not a blessing which lies on the other side death or as we usually speak in the other world the very words of the text itself put this beyond all question ye are saved it is not something at a distance it is a present thing a blessing which through the free mercy of god ye are now in possession of nay the words may be rendered and that with equal propriety ye have been saved so that the salvation which is here spoken of might be extended to the entire work of god from the first dawning of grace in the soul till it is consummated in glory  if we take this in its utmost extent it will include all that is wrought in the soul by what is frequently termed natural conscience but more properly preventing grace all the drawings of the father the desires after god which if we yield to them increase more and more all that light wherewith the son of god enlighteneth every one that cometh into the world showing every man to do justly to love mercy and to walk humbly with his god all the convictions which his spirit from time to time works in every child of manalthough it is true the generality of men stifle them as soon as possible and after a while forget or at least deny that they ever had them at all but we are at present concerned only with that salvation which the apostle is directly speaking of and this consists of two general parts justification and sanctification justification is another word for pardon it is the forgiveness of all our sins and  what is necessarily implied therein our acceptance with god the price whereby this hath been procured for us commonly termed the meritorious cause of our justification is the blood and righteousness of christ or to express it a little more clearly all that christ hath done and suffered for us till he poured out his soul for the transgressors the immediate effects of justification are the peace of   god a peace that passeth all understanding and a rejoicing in hope of the glory of god with joy unspeakable and full of glory and at the same time that we are justified yea in that very moment sanctification begins in that instant we are born again born from above born of the spirit there is a real as well as a relative change we are inwardly renewed by the power of god we feel the love of god shed abroad in our heart by the holy ghost which is given unto us producing love to all mankind and more especially to the children of god expelling the love of the world the love of pleasure of ease of honour of money together with pride anger selfwill and every other evil temper in a word changing the earthly sensual devilish mind into the mind which was in christ jesus how naturally do those who experience such a change imagine that all sin is gone that it is utterly rooted out of their heart and has no more any place therein how easily do they draw that inference i feel no sin therefore i have none it does not stir therefore it does not exist it has no motion therefore it has no being but it is seldom long before they are undeceived finding sin was only suspended not destroyed temptations return and sin revives showing it was but stunned before not dead they now feel two principles in themselves plainly contrary to each other the flesh lusting against the spirit nature opposing the grace of god they cannot deny that although they still feel power to believe in christ and to love god and although his spirit still witnesses with their spirits that they are children of god yet they feel in themselves sometimes pride or selfwill sometimes anger or unbelief they find one or more of these frequently stirring in their heart though not conquering yea perhaps thrusting sore at them that they may fall but the lord is their help how exactly did macarius fourteen hundred years ago describe the present experience of the children of god the unskilful or unexperienced when grace operates presently imagine they have no more sin whereas they that have discretion cannot deny that even we who have the grace of god may be molested again for we have often had instances of some among the brethren who have experienced such grace as to affirm that they had no sin in them and yet after all when they thought themselves entirely freed from it the corruption that lurked within was stirred up anew and they were wellnigh burned up from the time of our being born again the gradual work of sanctification takes place we are enabled by the spirit to mortify the deeds of the body of our evil nature and as we are more and more dead to sin we are more and more alive to god we so on from grace to grace while we are careful to abstain from all appearance of evil and are zealous of good works as we have opportunity doing good to all men while we walk in all his ordinances blameless therein worshipping him in spirit and in truth while we take up our cross and deny ourselves every pleasure that does not lead us to god  it is thus that we wait for entire sanctification for a full salvation from all our sins from pride selfwill anger unbelief or as the apostle expresses it go unto perfection but what is perfection the word has various senses here it means perfect love it is love excluding sin love filling the heart taking up the whole capacity of the soul it is love rejoicing evermore praying without ceasing in everything giving thanks ii but what is faith through which we are saved this is the second point to be considered 1 faith in general is defined by the apostle oprgmaton elegchos ou blepomenon an evidence a divine evidence and conviction the word means both of things not seen not visible not perceivable either by sight or by any other of the external senses it implies both a supernatural evidence of god and of the things of god a kind of spiritual light exhibited to the soul and a supernatural sight or perception thereof accordingly the scripture speaks of gods giving sometimes light sometimes a power of discerning it so st paul god who commanded light to shine out of darkness hath shined in our hearts to give us the light of the knowledge of the glory of god in the face of jesus christ and elsewhere the same apostle speaks of the eyes of our understanding being opened by this twofold operation of the holy spirit having the eyes of our soul both opened and enlightened we see   the things which the natural eye hath not seen neither the ear heard we have a prospect of the invisible things of god we see the spiritual world which is all round about us and yet no more discerned by our natural faculties than if it had no being and we see the eternal world piercing through the veil which hangs between time and eternity clouds and darkness then rest upon it no more but we already see the glory which shall be revealed taking the word in a more particular sense faith is a divine evidence and conviction not only that god was in christ reconciling the world unto himself but also that christ loved me and gave himself for me it is by this faith whether we term it the essence or rather a property thereof that we receive christ that we receive him in all his offices as our prophet priest and king it is by this that he is made of god unto us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption but is this the faith of assurance or faith of adherence the scripture mentions no such distinction the apostle says there is one faith and one hope of our calling one christian saving faith as there is one lord in whom we believe and one god and father of us all and it is certain this faith necessarily implies an assurance which is here only another word for evidence it being hard to tell the difference between them that christ loved me and gave himself for me for he that believeth with the true living faith hath the witness in himself the spirit witnesseth with his spirit that he is a child of god because he is a son god hath sent forth the spirit of his son into his heart crying abba father giving him an assurance that he is so and a childlike confidence in him but let it be observed that in the very nature of the thing the assurance goes before the confidence for a man cannot have a childlike confidence in god till he knows he is a child of god therefore confidence trust reliance adherence or whatever else it be called is not the first as some have supposed but the second branch or act of faith it is by this faith we are saved justified and sanctified taking that word in its highest sense but how are we justified and sanctified by faith this is our third head of inquiry and this being the main point in question and a point of no ordinary importance it will not be improper to five it a more distinct and particular consideration iii 1 and first how are we justified by faith in what sense is this to be understood i answer faith is the condition and the only condition of justification it is the condition none is justified but he that believes without faith no man is justified and it is the only condition this alone is sufficient for justification every one that believes is justified whatever else he has or has not in other words no man is justified till he believes every man when he believes is justified but does not god command us to repent also yea and to bring forth fruits meet for repentance to cease for instance from doing evil and learn to do well and is not both the one and the other of the utmost necessity insomuch that if we willingly neglect either we cannot reasonably expect to be justified at all but if this be so how can it be said that faith is the only condition of justification god does undoubtedly command us both to repent and to bring forth fruits meet for repentance which if we willingly neglect we cannot reasonably expect to be justified at all therefore both repentance and fruits meet for repentance are in some sense necessary to justification but they are not necessary in the same sense with faith nor in the same degree not in the same degree for those fruits are only necessary conditionally if there be time and opportunity for them otherwise a man may be justified without them as was the thief upon the cross if we may call him so for a late writer has discovered that he was no thief but a very honest and respectable person but he cannot be justified without faith this is impossible likewise let a man have ever so much repentance or ever so many of the fruits meet for repentance yet all this does not at all avail he is not justified till he believes but the moment he believes with or without those fruits yea with more or less repentance he is justified not in the same sense for repentance and its fruits are only remotely necessary necessary in order to faith whereas faith is immediately necessary to justification it remains that faith is the only condition which is immediately and proximately necessary to justification but do you believe we are sanctified by faith we know you believe that we are justified by faith but do not you believe and accordingly teach that we are sanctified by our works so it has been roundly and vehemently affirmed for these fiveandtwenty years but i have constantly declared just the contrary and that in all manner of ways i have continually testified in private and in public that   we are sanctified as well as justified by faith and indeed the one of those great truths does exceedingly illustrate the other exactly as we are justified by faith so are we sanctified by faith faith is the condition and the only condition of sanctification exactly as it is of justification it is the condition none is sanctified but he that believes with out faith no man is sanctified and it is the only condition this alone is sufficient for sanctification every one that believes is sanctified whatever else he has or has not in other words no man is sanctified till he believes every man when he believes is sanctified  but is there not a repentance consequent upon as well as a repentance previous to justification and is it not incumbent on all that are justified to be zealous of good works yea are not these so necessary that if a man willingly neglect them he cannot reasonably expect that he shall ever be sanctified in the full sense that is perfected in love nay can he grow at all in grace in the loving knowledge of our lord jesus christ yea can he retain the grace which god has already given him can he continue in the faith which he has received or in the favour of god do not you yourself allow all this and continually assert it but if this be so how can it be said that faith is the only condition of sanctification  i do allow all this and continually maintain it as the truth of god i allow there is a repentance consequent upon as well as a repentance previous to justification it is incumbent on all that are justified to be zealous of good works and there are so necessary that if a man willingly neglect them he cannot reasonably expect that he shall ever be sanctified he cannot grow in grace in the image of god the mind which was in christ jesus nay he cannot retain the grace he has received he cannot continue in faith or in the favour of god what is the inference we mist draw herefrom why that both repentance rightly understood and the practice of all good works works of piety as well as works of mercy now properly so called since they spring from faith are in some sense necessary to sanctification  i say repentance rightly understood for this must not be confounded with the former repentance the repentance consequent upon justification is widely different from that which is antecedent to it this implies no guilt no sense of condemnation no consciousness of the wrath of god it does not suppose any doubt of the favour of god or any fear that hath torment it is properly a conviction wrought by the holy ghost of the sin which still remains in our heart of the phronema sarkos the carnal mind which does still remain as our church speaks even in them that are regenerate although it does no longer reign it has not now dominion over them it is a conviction of our proneness to evil of an heart bent to backsliding of the still continuing tendency of the flesh to lust against the spirit sometimes unless we continually watch and pray it lusteth to pride sometimes to anger sometimes to love of the world love of ease love of honour or love of pleasure more than of god it is a conviction of the tendency of our heart to selfwill to atheism or idolatry and above all to unbelief whereby in a thousand ways and under a thousand pretenses we are ever departing more or less from the living god with this conviction of the sin remaining in our hearts there is joined a clear conviction of the sin remaining in our lives still cleaving to all our words and actions in the best of these we now discern a mixture of evil either in the spirit the matter or the manner of them something that could not endure the righteous judgement of god were he extreme to mark what is done amiss where we least suspected it we find a taint of pride or selfwill of unbelief or idolatry so that we are now more ashamed of our best duties than formerly of our worst sins and hence we cannot but feel that these are so far from having anything meritorious in them yea so far from being able to stand in sight of the divine justice that for those also we should be guilty before god were it not for the blood of the covenant  experience shows that together with this conviction of sin remaining in our hearts and cleaving to all our words and actions as well as the guilt which on account thereof we should incur were we not continually sprinkled with the atoning blood one thing more is implied in this repentance namely a conviction of our helplessness of our utter inability to think one good thought or to form one good desire and much more to speak one word aright or to perform one good action but through his free almighty grace first preventing us and then accompanying us every moment   but what good works are those the practice of which you affirm to be necessary to sanctification first all works of piety such as public prayer family prayer and praying in our closet receiving the supper of the lord searching the scriptures by hearing reading meditating and using such a measure of fasting or abstinence as our bodily health allows secondly all works of mercy whether they relate to the bodies or souls of men such as feeding the hungry clothing the naked entertaining the stranger visiting those that are in prison or sick or variously afflicted such as the endeavouring to instruct the ignorant to awaken the stupid sinner to quicken the lukewarm to confirm the wavering to comfort the feebleminded to succour the tempted or contribute in any manner to the saving of souls from death this is the repentance and these the fruits meet for repentance which are necessary to full sanctification this is the way wherein god hath appointed his children to wait for complete salvation hence may appear the extreme mischievousness of that seemingly innocent opinion that there is no sin in a believer that all sin is destroyed root and branch the moment a man is justified by totally preventing that repentance it quite blocks up the way to sanctification there is no place for repentance in him who believes there is no sin either in his life or heart consequently there is no place for his being perfected in love to which that repentance is indispensably necessary hence it may likewise appear that there is no possible danger in thus expecting full salvation for suppose we were mistaken suppose no such blessing ever was or can be attained yet we lose nothing nay that very expectation quickens us in using all the talents which god has given us yea in improving them all so that when our lord cometh he will receive his own with increase but to return though it be allowed that both this repentance and its fruits are necessary to full salvation yet they are not necessary either in the same sense with faith or in the same degree not in the same degree for these fruits are only necessary conditionally if there be time and opportunity for them otherwise a man may be sanctified without them but he cannot be sanctified without faith likewise let a man have ever so much of this repentance or ever so many good works yet all this does not at all avail he is not sanctified till he believes but the moment he believes with or without those fruits yea with more or less of this repentance he is sanctified not in the same sense for this repentance and these fruits are only remotely necessary necessary in order to the continuance of his faith as well as the increase of it whereas faith is immediately and directly necessary to sanctification it remains that faith is the only condition which is immediately and proximately necessary to sanctification but what is that faith whereby we are sanctified saved from sin and perfected in love it is a divine evidence and conviction first that god hath promised it in the holy scripture till we are thoroughly satisfied of this there in no moving one step further and one would imagine there needed not one word more to satisfy a reasonable man of this than the ancient promise then will i circumcise thy heart and the heart of thy seed to love the lord they god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind how clearly does this express the being perfected in love how strongly imply the being saved from all sin for as long as love takes up the whole heart what room is there for sin therein  it is a divine evidence and conviction secondly that what god hath promised he is able to perform admitting therefore that with men it is impossible to bring a clean thing out of an unclean to purify the heart from all sin and to till it with all holiness yet this creates no difficulty in the case seeing with god all things are possible and surely no one ever imagined it was possible to any power less than that of the almighty but if god speaks it shall be done god saith let there be light and there is light  it is thirdly a divine evidence and conviction that he is able and willing to do it now and why not is not a moment to him the same as a thousand years he cannot want more time to accomplish whatever is his will and he cannot want or stay for any more worthiness or fitness in the persons he is pleased to honour we may therefore boldly say at any point of time now is the day of salvation today if ye will hear his voice harden not your hearts behold all things are now ready come unto the marriage   to this confidence that god is both able and willing to sanctify us now there needs to be added one thing more a divine evidence and conviction that he doeth it in that hour it is done god says to the inmost soul according to thy faith be it unto thee then the soul is pure from every spot of sin it is clean from all unrighteousness the believer then experiences the deep meaning of those solemn words if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus christ his son cleanseth us from all sin but does god work this great work in the soul gradually or instantaneously perhaps it may be gradually wrought in some i mean in this sense they do not advert to the particular moment wherein sin ceases to be but it us infinitely desirable were it the will of god that it should be done instantaneously that the lord should destroy sin by the breath of his mouth in a moment in the twinkling of an eye and so he generally does a plain fact of which there is evidence enough to satisfy any unprejudiced person thou therefore look for it every moment look for it in the way above described in all those good works whereunto thou art created anew in christ jesus there in then no danger you can be no worse if you are no better for that expectation for were you to be disappointed of your hope still you lose nothing but you shall not be disappointed of your hope it will come and will not tarry look for it then every day every hour every moment why not this hour this moment certainly you may look for it now if you believe it is by faith and by this token you may surely know whether you seek it by faith or by works if by works you want something to be done first before you are sanctified you think i must first be or do thus or thus then you are seeking it by works unto this day if you seek it by faith you may expect it as you are and expect it now it is of importance to observe that there is an inseparable connexion between these three points expect it by faith expect it as you are and expect it now to deny one of them is to deny them all to allow one is to allow them all do you believe we are sanctified by faith be true then to your principle and look for this blessing just as you are neither better nor worse as a poor sinner that has still nothing to pay nothing to plead but christ died and if you look for it as you are then expect it now stay for nothing why should you christ is ready and he is all you want he is waiting for you he is at the door let your inmost soul cry out  come in come in thou heavenly guest nor hence again remove but sup with me and let the feast be everlasting love   sermon 44 text from the 1872 edition original sin and god saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually gen 65 how widely different is this from the fair pictures of human nature which men have drawn in all ages the writings of many of the ancients abound with gay descriptions of the dignity of man whom some of them paint as having all virtue and happiness in his composition or at least entirely in his power without being beholden to any other being yea as selfsufficient able to live on his own stock and little inferior to god himself nor have heathens alone men who are guided in their researches by little more than the dim light of reason but many likewise of them that bear the name of christ and to whom are entrusted the oracles of god spoken as magnificently concerning the nature of man as if it were all innocence and perfection accounts of this kind have particularly abounded in the present century and perhaps in no part of the world more than in our own country here not a few persons of strong understanding as well as extensive learning have employed their utmost abilities to show what they termed the fair side of human nature and it must he acknowledged that if their accounts of him be just man is still but a little lower than the angels or as the words may be more literally rendered a little less than god  is it any wonder that these accounts are very readily received by the generality of men for who is not easily persuaded to think favourably of himself accordingly writers of this kind are most universally read admired applauded and innumerable are the converts they have made not only in the gay but the learned world so that it is now quite unfashionable to talk otherwise to say any thing to the disparagement of human nature which is generally allowed notwithstanding a few infirmities to be very innocent and wise and virtuous but in the mean time what must we do with our bibles  for they will never agree with this these accounts however pleasing to flesh and blood are utterly irreconcilable with the scriptural the scripture avers that by one mans disobedience all men were constituted sinners that in adam all died spiritually died lost the life and the image of god that fallen sinful adam then begat a son in his own likeness  nor was it possible he should beget him in any other for who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean  that consequently we as well as other men were by nature dead in trespasses and sins without hope without god in the world and therefore children of wrath that every man may say i was shapen in wickedness and in sin did my mother conceive me that there is no difference in that all have sinned and come short of the glory of god of that glorious image of god wherein man was originally created and hence when the lord looked down from heaven upon the children of men he saw they were all gone out of the way they were altogether become abominable there was none righteous no not one none that truly sought after god just agreeable this to what is declared by the holy ghost in the words above recited god saw when he looked down from heaven before that the wickedness of man was great in the earth so great that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually this is gods account of man from which i shall take occasion first to show what men were before the flood secondly to inquire whether they are not the same now and thirdly to add some inferences i 1 i am first by opening the words of the text to show what men were before the flood and we may fully depend on the account here given for god saw it and he cannot be deceived he saw that the wickedness of man was great  not of this or that man not of a few men only not barely of the greater part but of man in general of men universally the word includes the whole human race every partaker of human nature and it is not easy for us to compute their numbers to tell how many   thousands and millions they were the earth then retained much of its primeval beauty and original fruitfulness the face of the globe was not rent and torn as it is now and spring and summer went hand in hand it is therefore probable it afforded sustenance for far more inhabitants than it is now capable of sustaining and these must be immensely multiplied while men begat sons and daughters for seven or eight hundred years together yet among all this inconceivable number only noah found favour with god he alone perhaps including part of his household was an exception from the universal wickedness which by the just judgment of god in a short time after brought on universal destruction all the rest were partakers in the same guilt as they were in the same punishment  god saw all the imaginations of the thoughts of his heart  of his soul his inward man the spirit within him the principle of all his inward and outward motions he saw all the imaginations it is not possible to find a word of a more extensive signification it includes whatever is formed made fabricated within all that is or passes in the soul every inclination affection passion appetite every temper design thought it must of consequence include every word and action as naturally flowing from these fountains and being either good or evil according to the fountain from which they severally flow now god saw that all this the whole thereof was evil  contrary to moral rectitude contrary to the nature of god which necessarily includes all good contrary to the divine will the eternal standard of good and evil contrary to the pure holy image of god wherein man was originally created and wherein he stood when god surveying the works of his hands saw them all to be very good contrary to justice mercy and truth and to the essential relations which each man bore to his creator and his fellowcreatures but was there not good mingled with the evil was there not light intermixed with the darkness no none at all god saw that the whole imagination of the heart of man was only evil it cannot indeed be denied but many of them perhaps all had good motions put into their hearts for the spirit of god did then also strive with man if haply he might repent more especially during that gracious reprieve the hundred and twenty years while the ark was preparing but still in his flesh dwelt no good thing all his nature was purely evil it was wholly consistent with itself and unmixed with anything of an opposite nature however it may still be matter of inquiry was there no intermission of this evil were there no lucid intervals wherein something good might be found in the heart of man we are not here to consider what the grace of god might occasionally work in his soul and abstracted from this we have no reason to believe there was any intermission of that evil for god who saw the whole imagination of the thoughts of his heart to be only evil saw likewise that it was always the same that it was only evil continually every year every day every hour every moment he never deviated into good ii such is the authentic account of the whole race of mankind which he who knoweth what is in man who searcheth the heart and trieth the reins hath left upon record for our instruction such were all men before god brought the flood upon the earth we are secondly to inquire whether they are the same now 1 and this is certain the scripture gives us no reason to think any otherwise of them on the contrary all the above cited passages of scripture refer to those who lived after the flood it was above a thousand years after that god declared by david concerning the children of men they are all gone out of the way of truth and holiness there is none righteous no not one and to this bear all the prophets witness in their several generations so isaiah concerning gods peculiar people and certainly the heathens were in no better condition the whole head is sick and the whole heart faint from the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness but wounds and bruises and putrifying sores the same account is given by all the apostles yea by the whole tenor of the oracles of god from all these we learn concerning man in his natural state unassisted by the grace of god that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart is still evil only evil and that continually   and this account of the present state of man is confirmed by daily experience it is true the natural man discerns it not and this is not to be wondered at so long as a man born blind continues so he is scarce sensible of his want much less could we suppose a place where all were born without sight would they be sensible of the want of it in like manner so long as men remain in their natural blindness of understanding they are not sensible of their spiritual wants and of this in particular but as soon as god opens the eyes of their understanding they see the state they were in before they are then deeply convinced that every man living themselves especially are by nature altogether vanity that is folly and ignorance sin and wickedness we see when god opens our eyes that we were before atheoi en toi kosmoi  without god or rather atheists in the world we had by nature no knowledge of god no acquaintance with him it is true as soon as we came to the use of reason we learned the invisible things of god even his eternal power and godhead from the things that are made from the things that are seen we inferred the existence of an eternal powerful being that is not seen but still although we acknowledged his being we had no acquaintance with him as we know there is an emperor of china whom yet we do not know so we knew there was a king of all the earth yet we knew him not indeed we could not by any of our natural faculties by none of these could we attain the knowledge of god we could no more perceive him by our natural understanding than we could see him with our eyes for no one knoweth the father but the son and he to whom the son willeth to reveal him and no one knoweth the son but the father and he to whom the father revealeth him we read of an ancient king who being desirous to know what was the natural language of men in order to bring the matter to a certain issue made the following experiment he ordered two infants as soon as they were born to be conveyed to a place prepared for them where they were brought up without any instruction at all and without ever hearing a human voice and what was the event why that when they were at length brought out of their confinement they spoke no language at all they uttered only inarticulate sounds like those of other animals were two infants in like manner to be brought up from the womb without being instructed in any religion there is little room to doubt but unless the grace of god interposed the event would be just the same they would have no religion at all thy would have no more knowledge of god than the beasts of the field than the wild asss colt such is natural religion abstracted from traditional and from the influences of gods spirit and having no knowledge we can have no love of god we cannot love him we know not most men talk indeed of loving god and perhaps imagine they do at least few will acknowledge they do not love him but the fact is too plain to be denied no man loves god by nature any more than he does a stone or the earth he treads upon what we love we delight in but no man has naturally any delight in god in our natural state we cannot conceive how any one should delight in him we take no pleasure in him at all he is utterly tasteless to us to love god it is far above out of our sight we cannot naturally attain unto it we have by nature not only no love but no fear of god it is allowed indeed that most men have sooner or later a kind of senseless irrational fear properly called superstition though the blundering epicureans gave it the name of religion yet even this is not natural but acquired chiefly by conversation or from example by nature god is not in all our thoughts we leave him to manage his own affairs to sit quietly as we imagine in heaven and leave us on earth to manage ours so that we have no more of the fear of god before our eyes than of the love of god in our hearts thus are all men atheists in the world but atheism itself does not screen us from idolatry in his natural state every man born into the world is a rank idolater perhaps indeed we may not be such in the vulgar sense of the word we do no like the idolatrous heathens worship molten or graven images we do not bow down to the stock of a tree to the work of our own hands we do not pray to the angels or saints in heaven any more than to the saints that are upon the earth but what then we have set up our idols in our hearts and to these we bow down and worship them we worship ourselves when we pay that honour to ourselves which is due to god only therefore all pride is idolatry it is ascribing to ourselves what is due to god alone and although pride was not made for man yet where is the man that is born without it but hereby we rob god of his unalienable right and idolatrously usurp his glory   but pride is not the only sort of idolatry which we are all by nature guilty of satan has stamped his own image on our heart in selfwill also i will said he before he was cast out of heaven i will sit upon the sides of the north i will do my own will and pleasure independently on that of my creator the same does every man born into the world say and that in a thousand instances nay and avow it too without ever blushing upon the account without either fear or shame ask the man why did you do this he answers because i had a mind to it what is this but because it was my will that is in effect because the devil and i agreed because satan and i govern our actions by one and the same principle the will of god mean time is not in his thoughts is not considered in the least degree although it be the supreme rule of every intelligent creature whether in heaven or earth resulting from the essential unalterable relation which all creature bear to their creator so far we bear the image of the devil and tread in his steps but at the next step we leave satan behind we run into an idolatry whereof he is not guilty i mean love of the world which is now as natural to every man as to love his own will what is more natural to us than to seek happiness in the creature instead of the creator  to seek that satisfaction in the works of his hands which can be found in god only what more natural than the desire of the flesh that is of the pleasure of sense in every kind men indeed talk magnificently of despising these low pleasures particularly men of learning and education they affect to sit loose to the gratification of these appetites wherein they stand on a level with the beasts that perish but it is mere affectation for every man is conscious to himself that in this respect he is by nature a very beast sensual appetites even those of the lowest kind have more or less the dominion over him they lead him captive they drag him to and fro in spite of his boasted reason the man with all his good breeding and other accomplishments has no preeminence over the goat nay it is much to be doubted whether the beast has not the preeminence over him certainly he has if we may hearken to one of their modern oracles who very decently tells us  once in a season beasts too taste of love only the beast of reason is its slave and in that folly drudges all the year a considerable difference indeed it must be allowed there is between man and man arising beside that wrought by preventing grace from difference of constitution and of education but notwithstanding this who that is not utterly ignorant of himself can here cast the first stone at another who can abide the test of our blessed lords comment on the seventh commandment he that looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart so that one knows not which to wonder at most the ignorance or the insolence of those men who speak with such disdain of them that are overcome by desires which every man has felt in his own breast the desire of every pleasure of sense innocent or not being natural to every child of man 10 and so is the desire of the eye the desire of the pleasures of the imagination these arise either from great or beautiful or uncommon objects  if the two former do not coincide with the latter for perhaps it would appear upon a diligent inquiry that neither grand nor beautiful objects please any longer than they are new that when the novelty of them is over the greatest part at least of the pleasure they give is over and in the same proportion as they become familiar they become flat and insipid but let us experience this ever so often the same desire will remain still the inbred thirst continues fixed in the soul nay the more it is indulged the more it increases and incites us to follow after another and yet another object although we leave every one with an abortive hope and a deluded expectation yea  the hoary fool who many days has struggled with continued sorrow renews his hope and fondly lays the desperate bet upon tomorrow   tomorrow comes tis noon tis night this day like all the former flies yet on he goes to seek delight tomorrow till tonight he dies 11 a third symptom of this fatal disease the love of the world which is so deeply rooted in our nature is the pride of life the desire of praise of the honour that cometh of men this the greatest admirers of human nature allow to be strictly natural as natural as the sight or hearing or any other of the external senses and are they ashamed of it even men of letters men of refined and improved understanding so far from it that they glory therein they applaud themselves for their love of applause yea eminent christians so called make no difficulty of adopting the saying of the old vain heathen animi dissoluti est et nequam negligere quid de se homines sentiant not to regard what men think of us is the mark of a wicked and abandoned mind so that to go calm and unmoved through honour and dishonour through evil report and good report is with them a sign of one that is indeed not fit to live  away with such a flow from the earth but would one imagine that these men had ever heard of jesus christ or his apostles or that they knew who it was that said how can ye believe who receive honour one of another and seek not the honour which cometh of god only but if this is really so if it be impossible to believe and consequently to please god so long as we receive or seek honour one of another and seek not the honour which cometh of god only then in what a condition are all mankind the christians as well as heathens since they all seek honour one of another since it is as natural for them so to do themselves being the judges as it is to see the light which strikes upon their eye or to hear the sound which enters their ear yea since they account it a sign of a virtuous mind to seek the praise of men and of a vicious one to be content with the honour that cometh of god only  iii 1 i proceed to draw a few inferences from what has been said and first from hence we may learn one grand fundamental difference between christianity considered as a system of doctrines and the most refined heathenism many of the ancient heathens have largely described the vices of particular men they have spoken much against their covetousness or cruelty their luxury or prodigality some have dared to say that no man is born without vices of one kind or another but still as none of them were apprized of the fall of man so none of them knew of his total corruption they knew not that all men were empty of all good and filled with all manner of evil they were wholly ignorant of the entire depravation of the whole human nature of every man born into the world in every faculty of his soul not so much by those particular vices which reign in particular persons as by the general flood of atheism and idolatry of pride selfwill and love of the world this therefore is the first grand distinguishing point between heathenism and christianity the one acknowledges that many men are infected with many vices and even born with a proneness to them but supposes withal that in some the natural good much overbalances the evil the other declares that all men are conceived in sin and shapen in wickedness  that hence there is in every man a carnal mind which is enmity against god which is not cannot be subject to his law and which so infects the whole soul that there dwelleth in him in his flesh in his natural state no good thing but every imagination of the thoughts of his heart is evil only evil and that continually 2 hence we may secondly learn that all who deny this call it original sin or by any other title are put heathens still in the fundamental point which differences heathenism from christianity they may indeed allow that men have many vices that some are born with us and that consequently we are not born altogether so wise or so virtuous as we should be there being few that will roundly affirm we are born with as much propensity to good as to evil and that every man is by nature as virtuous and wise as adam was at his creation but here is the shibboleth is man by nature filled with all manner of evil is he void of all good is he wholly fallen is his soul totally corrupted or to come back to the text is every imagination of the thoughts of his heart only evil continually allow this and you are so far a christian deny it and you are but an heathen still   we may learn from hence in the third place what is the proper nature of religion of the religion of jesus christ it is therapeia psyches gods method of healing a soul which is thus diseased hereby the great physician of souls applies medicines to heal this sickness to restore human nature totally corrupted in all its faculties god heals all our atheism by the knowledge of himself and of jesus christ whom he hath sent by giving us faith a divine evidence and conviction of god and of the things of god  in particular of this important truth christ loved me  and gave himself for me by repentance and lowliness of heart the deadly disease of pride is healed that of selfwill by resignation a meek and thankful submission to the will of god and for the love of the world in all its branches the love of god is the sovereign remedy now this is properly religion faith thus working by love working the genuine meek humility entire deadness to the world with a loving thankful acquiescence in and conformity to the whole will and word of god indeed if man were not thus fallen there would be no need of all this there would be no occasion for this work in the heart this renewal in the spirit of our mind the superfluity of godliness would then be a more proper expression than the superfluity of naughtiness for an outside religion without any godliness at all would suffice to all rational intents and purposes it does accordingly suffice in the judgment of those who deny this corruption of our nature they make very little more of religion than the famous mr hobbes did of reason according to him reason is only a wellordered train of words according to them religion is only a wellordered train of words and actions and they speak consistently with themselves for if the inside be not full of wickedness if this be clean already what remains but to cleanse the outside of the cup outward reformation if their supposition be just is indeed the one thing needful but ye have not so learned the oracles of god ye know that he who seeth what is in man gives a far different account both of nature and grace of our fall and our recovery ye know that the great end of religion is to renew our hearts in the image of god to repair that total loss of righteousness and true holiness which we sustained by the sin of our first parent ye know that all religion which does not answer this end all that stops short of this the renewal of our soul in the image of god after the likeness of him that created it is no other than a poor farce and a mere mockery of god to the destruction of our own soul o beware of all those teachers of lies who would palm this upon you for christianity regard them not although they should come unto you with all the deceivableness of unrighteousness with all smoothness of language all decency yea beauty and elegance of expression all professions of earnest good will to you and reverence for the holy scriptures keep to the plain old faith once delivered to the saints and delivered by the spirit of god to our hearts know your disease know your cure ye were born in sin therefore ye must be born again born of god by nature ye are wholly corrupted by grace ye shall be wholly renewed in adam ye all died in the second adam in christ ye all are made alive you that were dead in sins hath he quickened he hath already given you a principle of life even faith in him who loved you and gave himself for you now go on from faith to faith until your whole sickness be healed and all that mind be in you which was also in christ jesus   sermon 45 text of the 1872 ed the new birth ye must be born again john 37 if any doctrines within the whole compass of christianity may be properly termed fundamental they are doubtless these two  the doctrine of justification and that of the new birth the former relating to that great work which god does for us in forgiving our sins the latter to the great work which god does in us in renewing our fallen nature in order of time neither of these is before the other in the moment we are justified by the grace of god through the redemption that is in jesus we are also born of the spirit but in order of thinking as it is termed justification precedes the new birth we first conceive his wrath to be turned away and then his spirit to work in our hearts how great importance then must it be of to every child of man throughly to understand these fundamental doctrines from a full conviction of this many excellent men have wrote very largely concerning justification explaining every point relating thereto and opening the scriptures which treat upon it many likewise have wrote on the new birth and some of them largely enough but yet not so clearly as might have been desired nor so deeply and accurately having either given a dark abstruse account of it or a slight and superficial one therefore a full and at the same time a clear account of the new birth seems to be wanting still such as may enable us to give a satisfactory answer to these three questions first why must we be born again what is the foundation of this doctrine of the new birth secondly how must we be born again what is the nature of the new birth and thirdly wherefore must we be born again to what end is it necessary these questions by the assistance of god i shall briefly and plainly answer and then subjoin a few inferences which will naturally follow  i 1 and first why must we be born again what is the foundation of this doctrine the foundation of it lies near as deep as the creation of the world in the scriptural account whereof we read and god the threeone god said let us make man in our image after our likeness so god created man in his own image in the image of god created he him gen 126 27  not barely in his natural image a picture of his own immortality a spiritual being endued with understanding freedom of will and various affections  nor merely in his political image the governor of this lower world having dominion over the fishes of the sea and over all the earth  but chiefly in his moral image which according to the apostle is righteousness and true holiness eph 424 in this image of god was man made god is love accordingly man at his creation was full of love which was the sole principle of all his tempers thoughts words and actions god is full of justice mercy and truth so was man as he came from the hands of his creator god is spotless purity and so man was in the beginning pure from every sinful blot otherwise god could not have pronounced him as well as all the other work of his hands very good gen 131 this he could not have been had he not been pure from sin and filled with righteousness and true holiness for there is no medium if we suppose and intelligent creature not to love god not to be righteous and holy we necessarily suppose him not to be good at all much less to be very good 2 but although man was made in the image of god yet he was not made immutable this would have been inconsistent with the state of trial in which god was pleased to place him he was therefore created able to stand and yet liable to fall and this god himself apprized him of and gave him a solemn warning against it nevertheless man did not abide in honour he fell from his high estate he ate of the tree whereof the lord had commanded him thou shalt not eat thereof by this wilful act of disobedience to his creator this flat rebellion against his sovereign he openly declared that he would no longer have god to rule over him that he would be governed by his own will and not the will of him that created him and that he would not seek his happiness in god but in the world in the works of his hands now god had told him before in the day that thou eatest of that fruit thou shalt surely die and the word of the lord cannot be broken accordingly in that day he did die he died to god  the most dreadful of all deaths he lost the life of god he was separated from him in   union with whom his spiritual life consisted the body dies when it is separated from the soul the soul when it is separated from god but this separation from god adam sustained in the day the hour he ate of the forbidden fruit and of this he gave immediate proof presently showing by his behaviour that the love of god was extinguished in his soul which was now alienated from the life of god instead of this he was now under the power of servile fear so that he fled from the presence of the lord yea so little did he retain even of the knowledge of him who filleth heaven and earth that he endeavored to hide himself from the lord god among the trees of the garden gen 38 so had he lost both the knowledge and the love of god without which the image of god could not subsist of this therefore he was deprived at the same time and became unholy as well as unhappy in the room of this he had sunk into pride and selfwill the very image of the devil and into sensual appetites and desires the image of the beasts that perish if it be said nay but that threatening  in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die refers to temporal death and that alone to the death of the body only the answer is plain to affirm this is flatly and palpably to make god a liar to aver that the god of truth positively affirmed a thing contrary to truth for it is evident adam did not die in this sense in the day that he ate thereof he lived in the sense opposite to this death above nine hundred years after so that this cannot possibly be understood of the death of the body without impeaching the veracity of god it must therefore be understood of spiritual death the loss of the life and image of god and in adam all died all human kind all the children of men who were then in adams loins the natural consequence of this is that every one descended from him comes into the world spiritually dead dead to god wholly dead in sin entirely void of the life of god void of the image of god of all that righteousness and holiness wherein adam was created instead of this every man born into the world now bears the image of the devil in pride and selfwill the image of the beast in sensual appetites and desires this then is the foundation of the new birth  the entire corruption of our nature hence it is that being born in sin we must be born again hence every one that is born of a woman must be born of the spirit of god ii 1 but how must a man be born again what is the nature of the new birth this is the second question and a question it is of the highest moment that can be conceived we ought not therefore in so weighty a concern to be content with a slight inquiry but to examine it with all possible care and to ponder it in our hearts till we fully understand this important point and clearly see how we are to be born again not that we are to expect any minute philosophical account of the manner how this is done our lord sufficiently guards us against any such expectation by the words immediately following the text wherein he reminds nicodemus of as indisputable a fact as any in the whole compass of nature which notwithstanding the wisest man under the sun is not able fully to explain the wind bloweth where it listeth  not by thy power or wisdom and thou hearest the sound thereof  thou art absolutely assured beyond all doubt that it doth blow but thou canst not tell whence it cometh nor whither it goeth  the precise manner how it begins and ends rises and falls no man can tell so is every one that is born of the spirit  thou mayest be as absolutely assured of the fact as of the blowing of the wind but the precise manner how it is done how the holy spirit works this in the soul neither thou nor the wisest of the children of men is able to explain however it suffices for every rational and christian purpose that without descending into curious critical inquiries we can give a plain scriptural account of the nature of the new birth this will satisfy every reasonable man who desires only the salvation of his soul the expression being born again was not first used by our lord in his conversation with nicodemus it was well known before that time and was in common use among the jews when our saviour appeared among them when an adult heathen was convinced that the jewish religion was of god and desired to join therein it was the custom to baptize him first before he was admitted to circumcision and when he was baptized he was said to be born again by which they meant that he who was before a child of the devil was now adopted into the family of god and accounted one of his children this expression therefore which nicodemus being a teacher in israel ought to have understood well our lord uses in conversing with him only in a stronger sense than he was accustomed to and this might be the reason of his asking how can these things be they cannot be literally  a man cannot enter a   second time into his mothers womb and be born  but they may spiritually a man may be born from above born of god born of the spirit in a manner which bears a very near analogy to the natural birth before a child is born into the world he has eyes but sees not he has ears but does not hear he has a very imperfect use of any other sense he has no knowledge of any of the things of the world or any natural understanding to that manner of existence which he then has we do not even give the name of life it is then only when a man is born that we say he begins to live for as soon as he is born be begins to see the light and the various objects with which he is encompassed his ears are then opened and he hears the sounds which successively strike upon them at the same time all the other organs of sense begin to be exercised upon their proper objects he likewise breathes and lives in a manner wholly different from what he did before how exactly doth the parallel hold in all these instances while a man is in a mere natural state before he is born of god he has in a spiritual sense eyes and sees not a thick impenetrable veil lies upon them he has ears but hears not he is utterly deaf to what he is most of all concerned to hear his other spiritual senses are all locked up he is in the same condition as if he had them not hence he has no knowledge of god no intercourse with him he is not at all acquainted with him he has no true knowledge of the things of god either of spiritual or eternal things therefore though he is a living man he is a dead christian but as soon as he is born of god there is a total change in all these particulars the eyes of his understanding are opened such is the language of the great apostle and he who of old commanded light to shine out of darkness shining on his heart he sees the light of the glory of god his glorious love in the face of jesus christ his ears being opened he is now capable of hearing the inward voice of god saying be of good cheer thy sins are forgiven thee go and sin no more this is the purport of what god speaks to his heart although perhaps not in these very words he is now ready to hear whatsoever he that teacheth man knowledge is pleased from time to time to reveal to him he feels in his heart to use the language of our church the mighty working of the spirit of god not in a gross carnal sense as the men of the world stupidly and wilfully misunderstand the expression though they have been told again and again we mean thereby neither more nor less than this he feels is inwardly sensible of the graces which the spirit of god works in his heart he feels he is conscious of a peace which passeth all understanding he many times feels such a joy in god as is unspeakable and full of glory he feels the love of god shed abroad in his heart by the holy ghost which is given unto him and all his spiritual senses are then exercised to discern spiritual good and evil by the use of these he is daily increasing in the knowledge of god of jesus christ whom he hath sent and to all the things pertaining to his inward kingdom and now he may be properly said to live god having quickened him by his spirit he is alive to god through jesus christ he lives a life which the world knoweth not of a life which is hid with christ in god god is continually breathing as it were upon the soul and his soul is breathing unto god grace is descending into his heart and prayer and praise ascending to heaven and by this intercourse between god and man this fellowship with the father and the son as by a kind of spiritual respiration the life of god in the soul is sustained and the child of god grows up till he comes to the full measure of the stature of christ from hence it manifestly appears what is the nature of the new birth it is that great change which god works in the soul when he brings it into life when he raises it from the death of sin to the life of righteousness it is the change wrought in the whole soul by the almighty spirit of god when it is created anew in christ jesus when it is renewed after the image of god in righteousness and true holiness when the love of the world is changed into the love of god pride into humility passion into meekness hatred envy malice into a sincere tender disinterested love for all mankind in a word it is that change whereby the earthly sensual devilish mind is turned into the mind which was in christ jesus this is the nature of the new birth so is every one that is born of the spirit iii 1 it is not difficult for any who has considered these things to see the necessity of the new birth and to answer the third question wherefore to what end is it necessary that we should be born again it is very easily discerned that this is necessary first in order to holiness for what is holiness according to the oracles of god not a bare external religion a round of outward duties how many soever they be and how exactly soever performed no gospel holiness is no less than the image of god stamped upon the heart it is no other than the whole mind which was in christ jesus it consists of all heavenly affections and tempers mingled together in one it implies such a continual thankful love to him who hath not withheld from us his son his only son as makes it natural and in a   manner necessary to us to love every child of man as fills us with bowels of mercies kindness gentleness longsuffering it is such a love of god as teaches us to be blameless in all manner of conversation as enables us to present our souls and bodies all we are and all we have all our thoughts words and actions a continual sacrifice to god acceptable through christ jesus now this holiness can have no existence till we are renewed in the image of our mind it cannot commence in the soul till that change be wrought till by the power of the highest overshadowing us we are brought from darkness to light from the power of satan unto god that is till we are born again which therefore is absolutely necessary in order to holiness but without holiness no man shall see the lord shall see the face of god in glory of consequence the new birth is absolutely necessary in order to eternal salvation men may indeed flatter themselves so desperately wicked and so deceitful is the heart of man that they may live in their sins till they come to the last gasp and yet afterwards live with god and thousands do really believe that they have found a broad way which leadeth not to destruction what danger say they can a woman be in that is so harmless and so virtuous what fear is there that so honest a man one of so strict morality should miss of heaven especially if over and above all this they constantly attend on church and sacrament one of these will ask with all assurance what shall not i do as well as my neighbours yes as well as your unholy neighbours as well as your neighbours that die in their sins for you will all drop into the pit together into the nethermost hell you will all lie together in the lake of fire the lake of fire burning with brimstone then at length you will see but god grant you may see it before the necessity of holiness in order to glory and consequently of the new birth since none can be holy except he be born again for the same reason except he be born again none can be happy even in this world for it is not possible in the nature of things that a man should be happy who is not holy even the poor ungodly poet could tell us nemo malus felix no wicked man is happy the reason is plain all unholy tempers are uneasy tempers not only malice hatred envy jealousy revenge create a present hell in the breast but even the softer passions if not kept within due bounds give a thousand times more pain than pleasure even hope when deferred and how often must this be the case maketh the heart sick and every desire which is not according to the will of god is liable to pierce us through with many sorrows and all those general sources of sin  pride selfwill and idolatry  are in the same proportion as they prevail general sources of misery therefore as long as these reign in any soul happiness has no place there but they must reign till the bent of our nature is changed that is till we are born again consequently the new birth is absolutely necessary in order to happiness in this world as well as in the world to come iv i proposed in the last place to subjoin a few inferences which naturally follow from the preceding observations 1 and first it follows that baptism is not the new birth they are not one and the same thing many indeed seem to imagine that they are just the same at least they speak as if they thought so but i do not know that this opinion is publicly avowed by any denomination of christians whatever certainly it is not by any within these kingdoms whether of the established church or dissenting from it the judgment of the latter is clearly declared in the large catechism q 163 165  ed  q what are the parts of a sacrament a the parts of a sacrament are two the one an outward and sensible sign the other and inward and spiritual grace thereby signified  q what is baptism a baptism is a sacrament wherein christ hath ordained the washing with water to be a sign and seal of regeneration by his spirit here it is manifest baptism the sign is spoken of as distinct from regeneration the thing signified in the church catechism likewise the judgment of our church is declared with the utmost clearness what meanest thou by this word sacrament a i mean an outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual grace q what is the outward part or form in baptism a water wherein the person is baptized in the name of the father son and holy ghost q what is the inward part or thing signified a a death unto sin and a new birth unto righteousness nothing therefore is plainer than that according to the church of england baptism is not the new birth   but indeed the reason of the thing is so clear and evident as not to need any other authority for what can be more plain than the one is a visible the and invisible thing and therefore wholly different from each other  the one being an act of man purifying the body the other a change wrought by god in the soul so that the former is just as distinguishable from the latter as the soul from the body or water from the holy ghost from the preceding reflections we may secondly observe that as the new birth is not the same thing with baptism so it does not always accompany baptism they do not constantly go together a man my possibly be born of water and yet not be born of the spirit there may sometimes be the outward sign where there is not the inward grace i do not now speak with regard to infants it is certain our church supposes that all who are baptized in their infancy are at the same time born again and it is allowed that the whole office for the baptism of infants proceeds upon this supposition nor is it an objection of any weight against this that we cannot comprehend how this work can be wrought i infants for neither can we comprehend how it is wrought in a person of riper years but whatever be the case with infants it is sure all of riper years who are baptized are not at the same time born again the tree is known by its fruits and hereby it appears too plain to be denied that divers of those who were children of the devil before they were baptized continue the same after baptism for the works of their father they do they continue servants of sin without any pretence either to inward or outward holiness  a third inference which we may draw from what has been observed is that the new birth is not the same with sanctification this is indeed taken for granted by many particularly by an eminent writer in his late treatise on the nature and grounds of christian regeneration to wave several other weighty objections which might be made to that tract this is a palpable one it all along speaks of regeneration as a progressive work carried on in the soul by slow degrees from the time of our first turning to god this is undeniably true of sanctification but of regeneration the new birth it is not true this is a part of sanctification not the whole it is the gate to it the entrance into it when we are born again then our sanctification our inward and outward holiness begins and thenceforward we are gradually to grow up in him who is our head this expression of the apostle admirably illustrates the difference between one and the other and farther points out the exact analogy there is between natural and spiritual things a child is born of a woman in a moment or at least in a very short time afterward he gradually and slowly grows till he attains to the stature of a man in like manner a child is born of god in a short time if not in a moment but it is by slow degrees that he afterward grows up to the measure of the full stature of christ the same relation therefore which there is between our natural birth and our growth there is also between our new birth and our sanctification one point more we may learn from the preceding observations but it is a point of so great importance as my excuse the considering it the more carefully and prosecuting it at some length what must one who loves the souls of men and is grieved that any of them should perish say to one whom he sees living in sabbathbreaking drunkenness or any other wilful sin what can he say if the foregoing observations are true but you must be born again no says a zealous man that cannot be how can you talk so uncharitably to the man has he not been baptized already he cannot be born again now can he not be born again do you affirm this then he cannot be saved though he be as old as nicodemus was yet except he be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god therefore in saying he cannot be born again you in effect deliver him over to damnation and where lies the uncharitableness now  on my side or on yours i say he may be born again and so become an heir of salvation you say he cannot be born again and if so he must inevitably perish so you utterly block up his way to salvation and send him to hell out of mere charity but perhaps the sinner himself to whom in real charity we say you must be born again has been taught to say i defy your new doctrine i need not be born again i was born again when i was baptized what would you have me deny my baptism i answer first there is nothing under heaven which can excuse a lie otherwise i should say to an open sinner if you have been baptized do not own it for how highly does this aggravate your guilt how will it increase your damnation was you devoted to god at eight days old and have you been all these years devoting yourself to the devil was you even before you had the use of reason consecrated to god the father the son and the holy ghost and have you ever since you had the use of it been flying in the face of god and   consecrating yourself to satan does the abomination of desolation  the love of the word pride anger lust foolish desire and a whole train of vile affections  stand where it ought not have you set up all the accursed things in that soul which was once a temple of the holy ghost set apart for an habitation of god through the spirit yea solemnly given up to him and do you glory in this that you once belonged to god o be ashamed  blush  hide yourself in the earth  never boast more of what ought to fill you with confusion to make you ashamed before god and man i answer secondly you have already denied your baptism and that in the most effectual manner you have denied it a thousand and a thousand times and you do so still day by day for in your baptism you renounced the devil and all his works whenever therefore you give place to him again whenever you do any of the works of the devil then you deny your baptism therefore you deny it by every wilful sin by every act of uncleanness drunkenness or revenge by every obscene or profane word by every oath that comes out of your mouth every time you profane the day of the lord you thereby deny your baptism yea every time you do any thing to another which you would not he should do to you i answer thirdly be you baptized or unbaptized you must be born again otherwise it is not possible you should be inwardly holy and without inward as well as outward holiness you cannot be happy even in this world much less in the world to come do you say nay but i do no harm to any man i am honest and just in all my dealings i do not curse or take the lords name in vain i do not profane the lords day i am no drunkard i do not slander my neighbour nor live in any wilful sin if this be so it were much to be wished that all men went as far as you do but you must go farther yet or you cannot be saved still you must be born again do you add i do go farther yet for i not only do no harm but do all the good i can i doubt that fact i fear you have had a thousand opportunities of doing good which you have suffered to pass by unimproved and for which therefore you are accountable to god but if you had improved them all if you really had done all the good you possibly could to all men yet this does not at all alter the case still you must be born again without this nothing will do any good to your poor sinful polluted soul nay but i constantly attend all the ordinances of god i keep to my church and sacrament it is well you do but all this will not keep you from hell except you be born again go to church twice a day go to the lords table every week say ever so many prayers in private hear ever so many good sermons read ever so many good books still you must be born again none of

give me this to be born of the spirit to be received among the children of god let me be born not of corruptible seed but incorruptible by the word of god which liveth and abideth for ever and then let be daily grow in grace and in the knowledge of our lord and saviour jesus christ   sermon 46 text from the 1872 edition the wilderness state ye now have sorrow but i will see you again and your heart shall rejoice and your joy no man taketh from you john 1622 after god had wrought a great deliverance for israel by bringing them out of the house of bondage they did not immediately enter into the land which he had promised to their fathers but wandered out of the way in the wilderness and were variously tempted and distressed in like manner after god has delivered them that fear him from the bondage of sin and satan after they are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in jesus yet not many of them immediately enter into the rest which remaineth for the people of god the greater part of them wander more or less out of the good way into which he hath brought them they come as it were into a waste and howling desert where they are variously tempted and tormented and this some in allusion to the case of the israelites have termed a wilderness state certain it is that the condition wherein these are has a right the tenderest compassion they labour under an evil and sore disease though one that is not commonly understood and for this very reason it is the more difficult for them to find a remedy being in darkness themselves they cannot be supposed to understand the nature of their own disorder and few of their brethren nay perhaps of their teachers know either what their sickness is or how to heal it so much the more need there is to inquire first what is the nature of this disease secondly what is the cause and thirdly what is the cure of it  i 1 and first what is the nature of this disease into which so many fall after they have believed wherein does it properly consist and what are the genuine symptoms of it it properly consists in the loss of that faith which god once wrought in their heart they that are in the wilderness have not now that divine evidence that satisfactory conviction of things not seen which they once enjoyed they have not now that inward demonstration of the spirit which before enabled each of them to say the life i live i live by faith in the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me the light of heaven does not now shine in their hearts neither do they see him that is invisible but darkness is again on the face of their souls and blindness on the eyes of their understanding the spirit no longer witnesses with their spirits that they are the children of god neither does he continue as the spirit of adoption crying in their hearts abba father they have not now a sure trust in his love and a liberty of approaching him with holy boldness though he slay me yet will i trust in him is no more the language of their heart but they are shorn of their strength and become weak and feebleminded even as other men 2 hence secondly proceeds the loss of love which cannot but rise or fall at the same time and in the same proportion with true living faith accordingly they that are deprived of their faith are deprived of the love of god also they cannot now say lord thou knowest all things thou knowest that i love thee they are not now happy in god as everyone is that truly loves him they do not delight in him as in time past and smell the odour of his ointments once all their desire was unto him and to the remembrance of his name but now even their desires are cold and dead if not utterly extinguished and as their love of god is waxed cold so is also their love of their neighbour they have not now that zeal for the souls of men that longing after their welfare that fervent restless active desire of their being reconciled to god they do not feel those bowels of mercies for the sheep that are lost  that tender compassion for the ignorant and them that are out of the way once they were gentle toward all men meekly instructing such as opposed the truth and if any was overtaken in a fault restoring such an one in the spirit of meekness but after a suspense perhaps of many days anger begins to regain its power yea peevishness and impatience thrust sore at them that they may fall and it is well if they are not sometimes driven even to render evil for evil and railing for railing   in consequence of the loss of faith and love follows thirdly loss of joy in the holy ghost for if the loving consciousness of pardon be no more the joy resulting therefrom cannot remain if the spirit does not witness with our spirit that we are the children of god the joy that flowed from that inward witness must also be at an end and in like manner they who once rejoiced with joy unspeakable in hope of the glory of god now they are deprived of that hope full of immortality are deprived of the joy it occasioned as also of that which resulted from a consciousness of the love of god then shed abroad in their hearts for the cause being removed so is the effect the fountain being dammed up those living waters spring no more to refresh the thirsty soul with loss of faith and love and joy there is also joined fourthly the loss of that peace which once passed all understanding that sweet tranquillity of mind that composure of spirit is gone painful doubt returns doubt whether we ever did and perhaps whether we ever shall believe we begin to doubt whether we ever did find in our hearts the real testimony of the spirit whether we did not rather deceive our own souls and mistake the voice of nature for the voice of god nay and perhaps whether we shall ever hear his voice and find favour in his sight and these doubts are again joined with servile fear with that fear which hath torment we fear the wrath of god even as before we believed we fear lest we should be cast out of his presence and thence sink again into that fear of death from which we were before wholly delivered but even this is not all for loss of peace is accompanied with loss of power we know everyone who has peace with god through jesus christ has power over all sin but whenever he loses the peace of god he loses also the power over sin while that peace remained power also remained even over the besetting sin whether it were the sin of his nature his constitution of his education or that of his profession yea and over those evil tempers and desires which till then he could not conquer sin had then no more dominion over him but he hath now no more dominion over sin he may struggle indeed but he cannot overcome the crown is fallen from his head his enemies again prevail over him and more or less bring him into bondage the glory is departed from him even the kingdom of god which was in his heart he is dispossessed of righteousness as well as of peace and joy in the holy ghost  ii 1 such is the nature of what many have termed and not improperly the wilderness state but the nature of it may be more fully understood by inquiring secondly what are the causes of it these indeed are various but i dare not rank among these the bare arbitrary sovereign will of god he rejoiceth in the prosperity of his servants he delighteth not to afflict or grieve the children of men his invariable will is our sanctification attended with peace and joy in the holy ghost these are his own free gifts and we are assured the gifts of god are on his part without repentance he never repenteth of what he hath given or desires to withdraw them from us therefore he never deserts us as some speak it is we only that desert him i 2 the most usual cause of inward darkness is sin of one kind or another this it is which generally occasions what is often a complication of sin and misery and first sin of commission this may frequently be observed to darken the soul in a moment especially if it be a known a wilful or presumptuous sin if for instance a person who is now walking in the clear light of gods countenance should be any way prevailed on to commit a single act of drunkenness or uncleanness it would be no wonder if in that very hour he fell into utter darkness it is true there have been some very rare cases wherein god has prevented this by an extraordinary display of his pardoning mercy almost in the very instant but in general such an abuse of the goodness of god so gross an insult on his love occasions an immediate estrangement from god and a darkness that may be felt 3 but it may be hoped this case is not very frequent that there are not many who so despise the riches of his goodness as while they walk in his light so grossly and presumptuously to rebel against him that light is much more frequently lost by giving way to sins of omission this indeed does not immediately quench the spirit but gradually and slowly the former may be compared to pouring water upon a fire the latter to withdrawing the fuel from it and many times will that loving spirit reprove our neglect before he departs from us many are the inward checks the secret notices he gives before his influences are withdrawn so that only a train of omissions wilfully persisted in can bring us into utter darkness   perhaps no sin of omission more frequently occasions this than the neglect of private prayer the want whereof cannot be supplied by any other ordinance whatever nothing can be more plain than that the life of god in the soul does not continue much less increase unless we use all opportunities of communing with god and pouring out our hearts before him if therefore we are negligent of this if we suffer business company or any avocation whatever to prevent these secret exercises of the soul or which comes to the same thing to make us hurry them over in a slight and careless manner that life will surely decay and if we long or frequently intermit them it will gradually die away  another sin of omission which frequently brings the soul of a believer into darkness is the neglect of what was so strongly enjoined even under the jewish dispensation thou shalt in anywise rebuke thy neighbour and not suffer sin upon him thou shalt not hate thy brother in thy heart now if we do hate our brother in our heart if we do not rebuke him when we see him in a fault but suffer sin upon him this will soon bring leanness to our own soul seeing hereby we are partakers of his sin by neglecting to reprove our neighbour we make his sin our own we become accountable for it to god we saw his danger and gave him no warning so if he perish in his iniquity god may justly require his blood at our hands no wonder then if by thus grieving the spirit we lose the light of his countenance  a third cause of our losing this is the giving way to some kind of inward sin for example we know every one that is proud in heart is an abomination to the lord and that although this pride of heart should not appear in the outward conversation now how easily may a soul filled with peace and joy fall into this snare of the devil how natural is it for him to imagine that he has more grace more wisdom or strength than he really has to think more highly of himself than he ought to think how natural to glory in something he has received as if he had not received it but seeing god continually resisteth the proud and giveth grace only to the humble this must certainly obscure if not wholly destroy the light which before shone on his heart the same effect may be produced by giving place to anger whatever the provocation or occasion be yea though it were coloured over with the name of zeal for the truth or for the glory of god indeed all zeal which is any other than the flame of love is earthly animal devilish it is the flame of wrath it is flat sinful anger neither better nor worse and nothing is a greater enemy to the mild gentle love of god than this they never did they never can subsist together in one breast in the same proportion as this prevails love and joy in the holy ghost decrease this is particularly observable in the case of offence i mean anger at any of our brethren at any of those who are united with us either by civil or religious ties if we give way to the spirit of offence but one hour we lose the sweet influences of the holy spirit so that instead of amending them we destroy ourselves and become an easy prey to any enemy that assaults us but suppose we are aware of this snare of the devil we may be attacked from another quarter when fierceness and anger are asleep and love alone is waking we may be no less endangered by desire which equally tends to darken the soul this is the sure effect of any foolish desire any vain or inordinate affection if we set our affection on things of the earth on any person or thing under the sun if we desire anything but god and what tends to god if we seek happiness in any creature the jealous god will surely contend with us for he can admit of no rival and if we will not hear his warning voice and return to him with our whole soul we continue to grieve him with our idols and running after other gods we shall soon be cold barren and dry and the god of this world will blind and darken our hearts  but this he frequently does even when we do not give way to any positive sin it is enough it gives him sufficient advantage if we do not stir up the gift of god which is in us if we do not agonize continually to enter in at the strait gate if we do not earnestly strive for the mastery and take the kingdom of heaven by violence there needs no more than not to fight and we are sure to be conquered let us only be careless or faint in our mind let us be easy and indolent and our natural darkness will soon return and overspread our soul it is enough therefore if we give way to spiritual sloth this will effectually darken the soul it will as surely destroy the light of god if not so swiftly as murder or adultery   10 but it is well to be observed that the cause of our darkness whatsoever it be whether omission or commission whether inward or outward sin is not always nigh at hand sometimes the sin which occasioned the present distress may lie at a considerable distance it might be committed days or weeks or months before and that god now withdraws his light and peace on account of what was done so long ago is not as one might at first imagine an instance of his severity but rather a proof of his longsuffering and tender mercy he waited all this time if haply we would see acknowledge and correct what was amiss and in default of this he at length shows his displeasure if thus at last he may bring us to repentance ii 1 another general cause of this darkness is ignorance which is likewise of various kinds if men know not the scriptures if they imagine there are passages either in the old or new testament which assert that all believers without exception must sometimes be in darkness this ignorance will naturally bring upon them the darkness which they expect and how common a case has this been among us how few are there that do not expect it and no wonder seeing they are taught to expect it seeing their guides lead them into this way not only the mystic writers of the romish church but many of the most spiritual and experimental in our own very few of the last century excepted lay it down with all assurance as a plain unquestionable scripture doctrine and cite many texts to prove it 2 ignorance also of the work of god in the soul frequent occasions this darkness men imagine because so they have been taught particularly by writers of the romish communion whose plausible assertions too many protestants have received without due examination that they are not always to walk in luminous faith that this is only a lower dispensation that as they rise higher they are to leave those sensible comforts and to live by naked faith naked indeed if it be stripped both of love and peace and joy in the holy ghost that a state of light and joy is good but a state of darkness and dryness is better that it is by these alone we can be purified from pride love of the world and inordinate selflove and that therefore we ought neither to expect nor desire to walk in the light always hence it is though other reasons may concur that the main body of pious men in the romish church generally walk in a dark uncomfortable way and if ever they receive soon lose the light of god  iii 1 a third general cause of this darkness is temptation when the candle of the lord first shines on our head temptation frequently flees away and totally disappears all is calm within perhaps without too while god makes our enemies to be at peace with us it is then very natural to suppose that we shall not see war any more and there are instances wherein this calm has continued not only for weeks but for months or years but commonly it is otherwise in a short time the winds blow the rains descend and the floods arise anew they who know not either the son or the father and consequently hate his children when god slackens the bridle which is in their teeth  will show that hatred in various instances as of old he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the spirit even so it is now the same cause still producing the same effect the evil which yet remains in the heart will then also move afresh anger and many other roots of bitterness will endeavour to spring up at the same time satan will not be wanting to cast in his fiery darts and the soul will have to wrestle not only with the world not only with flesh and blood but with principalities and powers with the rulers of the darkness of this world with wicked spirits in high places now when so various assaults are made at once and perhaps with the utmost violence it is not strange if it should occasion not only heaviness but even darkness in a weak believer  more especially if he was not watching if these assaults are made in an hour when he looked not for them if he expected nothing less but had fondly told himself  the day of evil would return no more 2 the force of those temptations which arise from within will be exceedingly heightened if we before thought too highly of ourselves as if we had been cleansed from all sin and how naturally do we imagine this during the warmth of our first love how ready are we to believe that god has fulfilled in us the whole work of faith with power that because we feel no sin we have none in us but the soul is all love and well may a sharp attack from an enemy whom we supposed to be not only conquered but slain throw us into much heaviness of soul yea sometimes into utter darkness particularly when we reason with this enemy instead of instantly calling upon god and casting ourselves upon him by simple faith who alone knoweth how to deliver his out of temptation iii these are the usual causes of this second darkness inquire we thirdly what is the cure of it   to suppose that this is one and the same in all cases is a and fatal mistake and yet extremely common even among many who pass for experienced christians yea perhaps take upon them to be teachers in israel to be the guides of other souls accordingly they know and use but one medicine whatever be the cause of the distemper they begin immediately to apply the promises to preach the gospel as they call it to give comfort is the single point at which they aim in order to which they say many soft and tender things concerning the love of god to poor helpless sinners and the efficacy of the blood of christ now this is quackery indeed and that of the worse sort as it tends if not to kill mens bodies yet without the peculiar mercy of god to destroy both their bodies and souls in hell it is hard to speak of these daubers with untempered mortar these promisemongers as they deserve they well deserve the title which has been ignorantly given to others they are spiritual mountebanks they do in effect make the blood of the covenant an unholy thing they vilely prostitute the promises of god by thus applying them to all without distinction whereas indeed the cure of spiritual as of bodily diseases must be as various as are the causes of them the first thing therefore is to find out the cause and this will naturally point out the cure for instance is it sin which occasions darkness what sin is it outward sin of any kind does your conscience accuse you of committing any sin whereby you grieve the holy spirit of god is it on this account that he is departed from you and that joy and peace are departed with him and how can you expect they should return till you put away the accursed thing let the wicked forsake his way cleanse your hands ye sinners put away the evil of your doings so shall your light break out of obscurity the lord will return and abundantly pardon if upon the closest search you can find no sin of commission which causes the cloud upon your soul inquire next if there be not some sin of omission which separates between god and you do you not suffer sin upon your brother do you reprove them that sin in your sight do you walk in all the ordinances of god in public family private prayer if not if you habitually neglect any one of these known duties how can you expect that the light of his countenance should continue to shine upon you make haste to strengthen the things that remain then your soul shall live today if ye will hear his voice by his grace supply what is lacking when you hear a voice behind you saying this is the way walk thou in it harden not your heart be no more disobedient to the heavenly calling till the sin whether of omission or commission be removed all comfort is false and deceitful it is only skinning the wound over which still festers and rankles beneath look for no peace within till you are at peace with god which cannot be without fruits meet for repentance but perhaps you are not conscious of even any sin of omission which impairs your peace and joy in the holy ghost is there not then some inward sin which as a root of bitterness springs up in your heart to trouble you is not your dryness and barrenness of soul occasioned by your hearts departing from the living god has not the foot of pride come against you have you not thought of yourself more highly than you ought to think have you not in any respect sacrificed to your own net and burned incense to your own drag have you not ascribed your success in any undertaking to your own courage or strength or wisdom have you not boasted of something you have received as though you had not received it have you not gloried in anything save the cross of our lord jesus christ have you not sought after or desired the praise of men have you not taken pleasure in it if so you see the way you are to take if you have fallen by pride humble yourself under the mighty hand of god and he will exalt you in due time have you not forced him to depart from you by giving place to anger have you not fretted yourself because of the ungodly or been envious against the evildoers have you not been offended at any of your brethren looking at their real or imagined sin so as to sin yourself against the great law of love by estranging your heart from them then look unto the lord that you may renew your strength that all this sharpness and coldness may be done away that love and peace and joy may return together and you may be invariably kind to each other and tenderhearted forgiving one another even as god for christs sake hath forgiven you have not you given way to any foolish desire to any kind or degree of inordinate affection how then can the love of god have place in your heart till you put away your idols be not deceived god is not mocked he will not dwell in a divided heart as long therefore as you cherish delilah in your bosom he has no place there it is vain to hope for a recovery of his light till you pluck out the right eye and cast it from you o let there be no longer delay cry to him that he may enable you so to do bewail your own impotence and helplessness and the lord being your helper enter in at the   strait gate take the kingdom of heaven by violence cast out every idol from his sanctuary and the glory of the lord shall soon appear perhaps it is this very thing the want of striving spiritual sloth which keeps your soul in darkness you dwell at ease in the land there is no war in your coasts and so you are quiet and unconcerned you go on in the same even track of outward duties and are content there to abide and do you wonder meantime that your soul is dead o stir yourself up before the lord arise and shake yourself from the dust wrestle with god for the mighty blessing pour out your soul unto god in prayer and continue therein with all perseverance watch awake out of sleep and keep awake otherwise there is nothing to be expected but that you will be alienated more and more from the light and life of god  if upon the fullest and most impartial examination of yourself you cannot discern that you at present give way either to spiritual sloth or any other inward or outward sin then call to mind the time that is past consider your former tempers words and actions have these been right before the lord commune with him in your chamber and be still and desire of him to try the ground of your heart and bring to your remembrance whatever has at any time offended the eyes of his glory if the guilt of any unrepented sin remain on our soul it cannot be but you will remain in darkness till having been renewed by repentance you are again washed by faith in the fountain opened for sin and uncleanness  entirely different will be the manner of the cure if the cause of the disease be not sin but ignorance it may be ignorance of the meaning of scripture perhaps occasioned by ignorant commentators ignorant at least in this respect however knowing and learned they may be in other particulars and in this case that ignorance must be removed before we can remove the darkness arising from it we must show the true meaning of those texts which have been misunderstood my design does not permit me to consider all the passages of scripture which have been pressed into this service i shall just mention two or three which are frequently brought to prove that all believers must sooner or later walk in darkness 8 one of these is isaiah 5010 who is among you that feareth the lord and obeyeth the voice of his servant that walketh in darkness and hath no light let him trust in the name of the lord and stay upon his god but how does it appear either from the text or context that the person here spoken of ever had light one who is convinced of sin feareth the lord and obeyeth voice of his servant and him we should advise though he was still dark of soul and had never seen the light of gods countenance yet to trust in the name of the lord and stay upon his god this text therefore proves nothing less than that believer in christ must sometimes walk in darkness another text which has been supposed to speak the same doctrine is hosea 214 i will allure her and bring her into the wilderness and speak comfortably unto her hence it has been inferred that god will bring every believer into the wilderness into a state of deadness and darkness but it is certain the text speaks no such thing for it does not appear that it speaks of particular believers at all it manifestly refers to the jewish nation and perhaps to that only but if it be applicable to particular persons the plain meaning of it is this  i will draw him by love i will next convince him of sin and then comfort him by pardoning mercy a third scripture from whence the same inference has been drawn is that above recited ye now have sorrow but i will see you again and your heart shall rejoice and your joy no man taketh from you this has been supposed to imply that god would after a time withdraw himself from all believers and that they could not till after they had thus sorrowed have the joy which no man could take from them but the whole context shows that our lord is here speaking personally to the apostles and no others and that he is speaking concerning those particular events his own death and resurrection a little while says he and ye shall not see me viz whilst i am in the grave and again a little while and ye shall see me when i am risen from the dead ye will weep and lament and the world will rejoice but your sorrow shall be turned into joy  ye now have sorrow because i am about to be taken from your head but i will see you again after my resurrection and your heart shall rejoice and your joy which i will then give you no man taketh from you all this   we know was literally fulfilled in the particular case of the apostles but no inference can be drawn from hence with regard to gods dealings with believers in general a fourth text to mention no more which has been frequently cited in proof of the same doctrine is 1 peter 412 beloved think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you but this is full as foreign to the point as the preceding the text literally rendered runs thus beloved wonder not at the burning which is among you which is for your trial now however this may be accommodated to inward trials in a secondary sense yet primarily it doubtless refers to martyrdom and the sufferings connected with it neither therefore is this text anything at all to the purpose for which it is cited and we may challenge all men to bring one text either from the old or new testament which is any more to the purpose than this but is not darkness much more profitable for the soul than light is not the work of god in the heart most swiftly and effectually carried on during a state of inward suffering is not a believer more swiftly and thoroughly purified by sorrow than by joy  by anguish and pain and distress and spiritual martyrdoms than by continual peace so the mystics teach so it is written in their books but not in the oracles of god the scripture nowhere says that the absence of god best perfects his work in the heart rather his presence and a clear communion with the father and the son a strong consciousness of this will do more an hour than his absence in an age joy in the holy ghost will far more effectually purify the soul than the want of that joy and the peace of god is the best means of refining the soul from the dross of earthly affections away then with the idle conceit that the kingdom of god is divided against itself that the peace of god and joy in the holy ghost are obstructive of righteousness and that we are saved not by faith but by unbelief not by hope but by despair  so long as men dream thus they may well walk in darkness nor can the effect cease till the cause is removed but yet we must not imagine it will immediately cease even when the cause is no more when either ignorance or sin has caused darkness one or the other may be removed and yet the light which was obstructed thereby may not immediately return as it is the free gift of god he may restore it sooner or later as it pleases him in the case of sin we cannot reasonably expect that it should immediately return the sin began before the punishment which may therefore justly remain after the sin is at an end and even in the natural course of things though a wound cannot be healed while the dart is sticking in the flesh yet neither is it healed as soon as that is drawn out but soreness and pain may remain long after lastly if darkness be occasioned by manifold and heavy and unexpected temptations the best way of removing and preventing this is to teach believers always to expect temptation seeing they dwell in an evil world among wicked subtle malicious spirits and have an heart capable of all evil convince them that the whole work of sanctification is not as they imagined wrought at once that when they first believe the are but as newborn babes who are gradually to grow up and may expect many storms before they come to the full stature of christ above all let them be instructed when the storm is upon them not to reason with the devil but to pray to pour out their souls before god and show him of their trouble and these are the persons unto whom chiefly we are to apply the great and precious promises not to the ignorant till the ignorance is removed much less to the impenitent sinner to these we may largely and affectionately declare the loving kindness of god our saviour expatiate upon his tender mercies which have been ever of old here we may dwell upon the faithfulness of god whose word is tried to the uttermost and upon the virtue of that blood which was shed for us to cleanse us from all sin and god will then bear witness to his word and bring their souls out of trouble he will say arise shine for thy light is come and the glory of the lord is risen upon thee yea and that light if thou walk humbly and closely with god will shine more and more unto the perfect day   sermon 47 text from the 1872 edition heaviness through manifold temptations now for a season if need be ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations 1 pet 16 1 in the preceding discourse i have particularly spoken of that darkness of mind into which those are often observed to fall who once walked in the light of gods countenance nearly related to this is the heaviness of soul which is still more common even among believers indeed almost all the children of god experience this in an higher or lower degree and so great is the resemblance between one and the other that they are frequently confounded together and we are apt to say indifferently such an one is in darkness or such an one is in heaviness  as if they were equivalent terms one of which implied no more than the other but they are far very far from it darkness is one thing heaviness is another there is a difference yea a wide an essential difference between the former and the latter and such a difference it is as all the children of god are deeply concerned to understand otherwise nothing will be more easy than for them to slide out of heaviness into darkness in order to prevent this i will endeavor to show i what manner of persons those were to whom the apostle says ye are in heaviness ii what kind of heaviness they were in iii what were the causes and iv what were the ends of it i shall conclude with some inferences i 1 i am in the first place to show what manner of persons those were to whom the apostle says ye are in heaviness and first it is beyond all dispute that they were believers at the time the apostle thus addressed them for so he expressly says 1 pet 15 ye who are kept through the power of god by faith unto salvation again 1 pet 17 he mentions the trial of their faith much more precious than that of gold which perisheth and yet again 1 pet 19 he speaks of their receiving the end of their faith the salvation of their souls at the same time therefore that they were in heaviness they were possessed of living faith their heaviness did not destroy their faith they still endured as seeing him that is invisible neither did their heaviness destroy their peace the peace that passeth all understanding which is inseparable from true living faith this we may easily gather from the second verse wherein the apostle prays not that grace and peace may be given them but only that it may be multiplied unto them that the blessing which they already enjoyed might be more abundantly bestowed upon them the persons to whom the apostle here speaks were also full of a living hope for thus he speaks 1 pet 13 blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again  me and you all of us who are sanctified by the spirit and enjoy the sprinkling of the blood of jesus christ  unto a living hope unto an inheritance  that is unto a living hope of an inheritance incorruptible undefiled and that fadeth not away so that notwithstanding their heaviness they still retained an hope full of immortality and they still rejoiced in hope of the glory of god they were filled with joy in the holy ghost so 1 pet 18 the apostle having just mentioned the final revelation of jesus christ namely when he cometh to judge the world immediately adds in whom though now ye see him not not with your bodily eyes yet believing ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory their heaviness therefore was not only consistent with living hope but also with joy unspeakable at the same time they were thus heavy they nevertheless rejoiced with joy full of glory   in the midst of their heaviness they likewise still enjoyed the love of god which had been shed abroad in their hearts  whom says the apostle having not seen ye love though ye have not yet seen him face to face yet knowing him by faith ye have obeyed his word my son give me thy heart he is your god and your love the desire of your eyes and your exceeding great reward ye have sought and found happiness in him ye delight in the lord and he hath given you your hearts desire once more though they were heavy yet were they holy they retained the same power over sin they were still kept from this by the power of god they were obedient children not fashioned according to their former desires but as he that had called them is holy so were they holy in all manner of conversation knowing they were redeemed by the precious blood of christ as a lamb without spot and without blemish they had through the faith and hope which they had in god purified their souls by the spirit so that upon the whole their heaviness well consisted with faith with hope with love of god and man with the peace of god with joy in the holy ghost with inward and outward holiness it did no way impair much less destroy any part of the work of god in their hearts it did not at all interfere with that sanctification of the spirit which is the root of all true obedience neither with the happiness which must needs result from grace and peace reigning in the heart  ii 1 hence we may easily learn what kind of heaviness they were in  the second thing which i shall endeavor to show the word in the original is lupethentes  made sorry grieved from lupe  grief or sorrow this is the constant literal meaning of the word and this being observed there is no ambiguity in the expression nor any difficulty in understanding it the persons spoken of here were grieved the heaviness they were in was neither more nor less than sorrow or grief  a passion which every child of man is well acquainted with it is probable our translators rendered it heaviness though a less common word to denote two things first the degree and next the continuance of it it does indeed seem that it is not a slight or inconsiderable degree of grief which is here spoken of but such as makes a strong impression upon and sinks deep into the soul neither does this appear to be a transient sorrow such as passes away in an hour but rather such as having taken fast hold of the heart is not presently shaken off but continues for some time as a settled temper rather than a passion  even in them that have living faith in christ and the genuine love of god in their hearts even in these this heaviness may sometimes be so deep as to overshadow the whole soul to give a colour as it were to all the affections such as will appear in the whole behavior it may likewise have an influence over the body particularly in those that are either of a naturally weak constitution or weakened by some accidental disorder especially of the nervous kind in many cases we find the corruptible body presses down the soul in this the soul rather presses down the body and weakens it more and more nay i will not say that deep and lasting sorrow of heart may not sometimes weaken a strong constitution and lay the foundation of such bodily disorders as are not easily removed and yet all this may consist with a measure of that faith which still worketh by love this may well be termed a fiery trial and though it is not the same with that the apostle speaks of in the fourth chapter 1 pet 4 yet many of the expressions there used concerning outward sufferings may be accommodated to this inward affliction they cannot indeed with any propriety be applied to them that are in darkness these do not cannot rejoice neither is it true that the spirit of glory and of god resteth upon them but he frequently doth on those that are in heaviness so that though sorrowful yet are they always rejoicing iii 1 but to proceed to the third point what are the causes of such sorrow or heaviness in a true believer the apostle tells us clearly ye are in heaviness says he through manifold temptations poikilois manifold not only many in number but of many kinds they may be varied and diversified a thousand ways by the change or addition of numberless circumstances and this very diversity and variety makes it more difficult to guard against them among these we may rank all bodily disorders particularly acute diseases and violent pain of every kind whether affecting the whole body or the smallest part of it it is true some who have enjoyed uninterrupted health and have felt none of these may make light of them and wonder that sickness or pain of body should bring   heaviness upon the mind and perhaps one in a thousand is of so peculiar a constitution as not to feel pain like other men so hath it pleased god to show his almighty power by producing some of these prodigies of nature who have seemed not to regard pain at all though of the severest kind if that contempt of pain was not owing partly to the force of education partly to a preternatural cause  to the power either of good or evil spirits who raised those men above the state of mere nature but abstracting from these particular cases it is in general a just observation that pain is perfect misery and extreme quite overturns all patience and even where this is prevented by the grace of god where men do possess their souls in patience it may nevertheless occasion much inward heaviness the soul sympathizing with the body all diseases of long continuance though less painful are apt to produce the same effect when god appoints over us consumption or the chilling and burning ague if it be not speedily removed it will not only consume the eyes but cause sorrow of heart this is eminently the case with regard to all those which are termed nervous disorders and faith does not overturn the course of nature natural causes still produce natural effects faith no more hinders the sinking of the spirits as it is called in an hysteric illness than the rising of the pulse in a fever again when calamity cometh as a whirlwind and poverty as an armed man is this a little temptation is it strange if it occasion sorrow and heaviness although this also may appear but a small thing to those who stand at a distance or who look and pass by on the other side yet it is otherwise to them who feel it having food and raiment indeed the latter word skepasmata implies lodging as well as apparel we may if the love of god is in our hearts be therewith content but what shall they do who have none of these who as it were embrace the rock for a shelter who have only the earth to lie upon and only the sky to cover them who have not a dry or warm much less a clean abode for themselves and their little ones no nor clothing to keep themselves or those they love next themselves from pinching cold either by day or night i laugh at the stupid heathen crying out  nil habet njelix paupertas durtus tn se quam quod ndiculos homines facit has poverty nothing worse in it than this that it makes men liable to be laughed at it is a sign this idle poet talked by rote of the things which he knew not is not want of food something worse than this god pronounced it as a curse upon man that he should earn it by the sweat of his brow but how many are there in this christian country that toil and labour and sweat and have it not at last but struggle with weariness and hunger together is it not worse for one after an hard days labour to come back to a poor cold dirty uncomfortable lodging and to find there not even the food which is needful to repair his wasted strength you that live at ease in the earth that want nothing but eyes to see ears to hear and hearts to understand how well god has dealt with you  is it not worse to seek bread day by day and find none perhaps to find the comfort also of five or six children crying for what he has not to give were it not that he is restrained by an unseen hand would he not soon curse god and die o want of bread want of bread who can tell what this means unless he hath felt it himself i am astonished it occasions no more than heaviness even in them that believe 4 perhaps next to this we may place the death of those who were near and dear unto us of a tender parent and one not much declined into the vale of years of a beloved child just rising into life and clasping about our heart of a friend that was as our own soul  next the grace of god the last best gift of heaven and a thousand circumstances may enhance the distress perhaps the child the friend died in our embrace  perhaps was snatched away when we looked not for it flourishing cut down like a flower in all these cases we not only may but ought to be affected it is the design of god that we should he would not have us stocks and stones he would have our affections regulated not extinguished therefore  nature unreproved may drop a tear there may be sorrow without sin   a still deeper sorrow we may feel for those who are dead while they live on account of the unkindness ingratitude apostasy of those who were united to us in the closest ties who can express what a lover of souls may feel for a friend a brother dead to god for an husband a wife a parent a child rushing into sin as an horse into the battle and in spite of all arguments and persuasions hasting to work out his own damnation and this anguish of spirit may be heightened to an inconceivable degree by the consideration that he who is now posting to destruction once ran well in the way of life whatever he was in time past serves now to no other purpose than to make our reflections on what he is more piercing and afflictive in all these circumstances we may be assured our great adversary will not be wanting to improve his opportunity he who is always walking about seeking whom he may devour will then especially use all his power all his skill if haply he may gain any advantage over the soul that is already cast down he will not be sparing of his fiery darts such as are most likely to find an entrance and to fix most deeply in the heart by their suitableness to the temptation that assaults it he will labour to inject unbelieving or blasphemous or repining thoughts he will suggest that god does not regard does not govern the earth or at least that he does not govern it aright not by the rules of justice and mercy he will endeavor to stir up the heart against god to renew our natural enmity against him and if we attempt to fight him with his own weapons if we begin to reason with him more and more heaviness will undoubtedly ensue if not utter darkness it has been frequently supposed that there is another cause if not of darkness at least of heaviness namely gods withdrawing himself from the soul because it is his sovereign will certainly he will do this if we grieve his holy spirit either by outward or inward sin either by doing evil or neglecting to do good by giving way either to pride or anger to spiritual sloth to foolish desire or inordinate affection but that he ever withdraws himself because he will merely because it is his good pleasure i absolutely deny there is no text in all the bible which gives any colour for such a supposition nay it is a supposition contrary not only to many particular texts but to the whole tenor of scripture it is repugnant to the very nature of god it is utterly beneath his majesty and wisdom as an eminent writer strongly expresses it to play at bopeep with his creatures it is inconsistent both with his justice and mercy and with the sound experience of all his children one more cause of heaviness is mentioned by many of those who are termed mystic authors and the notion has crept in i know not how even among plain people who have no acquaintance with them i cannot better explain this than in the words of a late writer who relates this as her own experience  i continued so happy in my beloved that although i should have been forced to live a vagabond in a desert i should have found no difficulty in it this state had not lasted long when in effect i found myself led into a desert i found myself in a forlorn condition altogether poor wretched and miserable the proper source of this grief is the knowledge of ourselves by which we find that there is an extreme unlikeness between god and us we see ourselves most opposite to him and that our inmost soul is entirely corrupted depraved and full of all kind of evil and malignity of the world and the flesh and all sorts of abominations  from hence it has been inferred that the knowledge of ourselves without which we should perish everlastingly must even after we have attained justifying faith occasion the deepest heaviness but upon this i would observe 1 in the preceding paragraph this writer says hearing i had not a true faith in christ i offered myself up to god and immediately felt his love it may be so and yet it does not appear that this was justification it is more probable it was no more than what are usually termed the drawings of the father and if so the heaviness and darkness which followed was no other than conviction of sin which in the nature of things must precede that faith whereby we are justified 2 suppose she was justified almost the same moment she was convinced of wanting faith there was then no time for that graduallyincreasing selfknowledge which uses to precede justification in this case therefore it came after and was probably the more severe the less it was expected 3 it is allowed there will be a far deeper a far clearer and fuller knowledge of our inbred sin of our total corruption by nature after justification than ever there was before it but this need not occasion darkness of soul i will not say that it must bring us into heaviness were it so the apostle would not have used that expression if need be for there would be an absolute indispensable need of it for all that would know themselves that is in effect for all that would know the perfect love of god and be thereby made meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light but   this is by no means the case on the contrary god may increase the knowledge of ourselves to any degree and increase in the same proportion the knowledge of himself and the experience of his love and in this case there would be no desert no misery no forlorn condition but love and peace and joy gradually springing up into everlasting life iv 1 for what ends then which was the fourth thing to be considered does god permit heaviness to befall so many of his children the apostle gives us a plain and direct answer to this important question that the trial of their faith which is much more precious than gold that perisheth though it be tried by fire may be found unto praise and honour and glory at the revelation of jesus christ1 pet 17 there may be an allusion to this in that wellknown passage of the fourth chapter although it primarily relates to quite another thing as has been already observed think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you but rejoice that ye are partakers of the sufferings of christ that when his glory shall be revealed ye may likewise rejoice with exceeding great joy 1 pet 412c  hence we learn that the first and great end of gods permitting the temptations which bring heaviness on his children is the trial of their faith which is tried by these even as gold by the fire now we know gold tried in the fire is purified thereby is separated from its dross and so is faith in the fire of temptation the more it is tried the more it is purified  yea and not only purified but also strengthened confirmed increased abundantly by so many more proofs of the wisdom and power the love and faithfulness of god this then  to increase our faith  is one gracious end of gods permitting those manifold temptations they serve to try to purify to confirm and increase that living hope also where unto the god and father of our lord jesus christ hath begotten us again of his abundant mercy indeed our hope cannot but increase in the same proportion with our faith on this foundation it stands believing in his name living by faith in the son of god we hope for we have a confident expectation of the glory which shall be revealed and consequently whatever strengthens our faith increases our hope also at the same time it increases our joy in the lord which cannot but attend an hope full of immortality in this view the apostle exhorts believers in the other chapter rejoice that ye are partakers of the sufferings of christ on this very account happy are you for the spirit of glory and of god resteth upon you and hereby ye are enabled even in the midst of sufferings to rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory  they rejoice the more because the trials which increase their faith and hope increase their love also both their gratitude to god for all his mercies and their goodwill to all mankind accordingly the more deeply sensible they are of the lovingkindness of god their saviour the more is their heart inflamed with love to him who first loved us the clearer and stronger evidence they have of the glory that shall be revealed the more do they love him who hath purchased it for them and given them the earnest thereof in their hearts and this the increase of their love is another end of the temptations permitted to come upon them yet another is their advance in holiness holiness of heart and holiness of conversation the latter naturally resulting from the former for a good tree will bring forth good fruit and all inward holiness is the immediate fruit of the faith that worketh by love by this the blessed spirit purifies the heart from pride selfwill passion from love of the world from foolish and hurtful desires from vile and vain affections beside that sanctified afflictions have through the grace of god an immediate and direct tendency to holiness through the operation of his spirit they humble more and more and abase the soul before god they calm and meeken our turbulent spirit tame the fierceness of our nature soften our obstinacy and selfwill crucify us to the world and bring us to expect all our strength from and to seek all our happiness in god and all these terminate in that great end that our faith hope love and holiness may be found if it doth not yet appear unto praise from god himself and honour from men and angels and glory assigned by the great judge to all that have endured unto the end and this will be assigned in that awful day to every man according to his works according to the work which god had wrought in his heart and the outward works which he has wrought for god and likewise according to what he   had suffered so that all these trials are unspeakable gain so many ways do these light afflictions which are but for a moment work out for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory 7 add to this the advantage which others may receive by seeing our behavior under affliction we find by experience example frequently makes a deeper impression upon us than precept and what examples have a stronger influence not only on those who are partakers of like precious faith but even on them who have not known god than that of a soul calm and serene in the midst of storms sorrowful yet always rejoicing meekly accepting whatever is the will of god however grievous it may be to nature saying in sickness and pain the cup which my father hath given me shall i not drink it  in loss or want the lord gave the lord hath taken away blessed be the name of the lord v 1 i am to conclude with some inferences and first how wide is the difference between darkness of soul and heaviness which nevertheless are so generally confounded with each other even by experienced christians darkness or the wildernessstate implies a total loss of joy in the holy ghost heaviness does not in the midst of this we may rejoice with joy unspeakable they that are in darkness have lost the peace of god they that are in heaviness have not so far from it that at the very time peace as well as grace may be multiplied unto them in the former the love of god is waxed cold if it be not utterly extinguished in the latter it retains its full force or rather increases daily in these faith itself if not totally lost is however grievously decayed their evidence and conviction of things not seen particularly of the pardoning love of god is not so clear or strong as in time past and their trust in him is proportionably weakened those though they see him not yet have a clear unshaken confidence in god and an abiding evidence of that love whereby all their sins are blotted out so that as long as we can distinguish faith from unbelief hope from despair peace from war the love of god from the love of the world we may infallibly distinguish heaviness from darkness  we may learn from hence secondly that there may be need of heaviness but there can be no need of darkness there may be need of our being in heaviness for a season in order to the ends above recited at least in this sense as it is a natural result of those manifold temptations which are needful to try and increase our faith to confirm and enlarge our hope to purify our heart from all unholy tempers and to perfect us in love and by consequence they are needful in order to brighten our crown and add to our eternal weight of glory but we cannot say that darkness is needful in order to any of these ends it is no way conducive to them the loss of faith hope love is surely neither conducive to holiness nor to the increase of that reward in heaven which will be in proportion to our holiness on earth  from the apostles manner of speaking we may gather thirdly that even heaviness is not always needful now for a season if need be so it is not needful for all persons nor for any person at all times god is able he has both power and wisdom to work when he pleases the same work of grace in any soul by other means and in some instances he does so he causes those whom it pleaseth him to go on from strength to strength even till they perfect holiness in his fear with scarce any heaviness at all as having an absolute power over the heart of man and moving all the springs of it at his pleasure but these cases are rare god generally sees good to try acceptable men in the furnace of affliction so that manifold temptations and heaviness more or less are usually the portion of his dearest children  we ought therefore lastly to watch and pray and use our utmost endeavours to avoid falling into darkness but we need not be solicitous how to avoid so much as how to improve by heaviness our great care should be so to behave ourselves under it so to wait upon the lord therein that it may fully answer all the design of his love in permitting it to come upon us that it may be a means of increasing our faith of confirming our hope of perfecting us in all holiness whenever it comes let us have an eye to these gracious ends for which it is permitted and use all diligence that we may not make void the counsel of god against ourselves let us earnestly work together with him by the grace which he is continually giving us in purifying ourselves from all pollution both of flesh and spirit and daily growing in the grace of our lord jesus christ till we are received into his everlasting kingdom   sermon 48 selfdenial and he said to them all if any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me luke 923 it has been frequently imagined that the direction here given related chiefly if not wholly to the apostles at least to the christians of the first ages or those in a state of persecution but this is a grievous mistake for although our blessed lord is here directing his discourse more immediately to his apostles and those other disciples who attended him in the days of his flesh yet in them he speaks to us and to all mankind without any exception or limitation the very reason of the thing puts it beyond dispute that the duty which is here enjoined is not peculiar to them or to the christians of the early ages it no more regards any particular order of men or particular time than any particular country no it is of the most universal nature respecting all times and all persons yea and all things not meats and drinks only and things pertaining to the senses the meaning is if any man of whatever rank station circumstances in any nation in any age of the world will effectually come after me let him deny himself in all things let him take up his cross of whatever kind yea and that daily and follow me the denying ourselves and the taking up our cross in the full extent of the expression is not a thing of small concern it is not expedient only as are some of the circumstantials of religion but it is absolutely indispensably necessary either to our becoming or continuing his disciples it is absolutely necessary in the very nature of the thing to our coming after him and following him insomuch that as far as we do not practise it we are not his disciples if we do not continually deny ourselves we do not learn of him but of other masters if we do not take up our cross daily we do not come after him but after the world or the prince of the world or our own fleshly mind if we are not walking in the way of the cross we are not following him we are not treading in his steps but going back from or at least wide of him it is for this reason that so many ministers of christ in almost every age and nation particularly since the reformation of the church from the innovations and corruptions gradually crept into it have wrote and spoke so largely on this important duty both in their public discourses and private exhortations this induced them to disperse abroad many tracts upon the subject and some in our own nation they knew both from the oracles of god and from the testimony of their own experience how impossible it was not to deny our master unless we will deny ourselves and how vainly we attempt to follow him that was crucified unless we take up our cross daily but may not this very consideration make it reasonable to inquire if much has been said and wrote on the subject already what need is there to say or write any more i answer there are no inconsiderable numbers even of people fearing god who have not had the opportunity either of hearing what has been spoke or reading what has been wrote upon it and perhaps if they had read much of what has been written they would not have been so much profited many who have wrote some of them large volumes do by no means appear to have understood the subject either they had imperfect views of the very nature of it and then they could never explain it to others or they were unacquainted with the due extent of it they did not see how exceeding broad this command is or they were not sensible of the absolute the indispensable necessity of it others speak of it in so dark so perplexed so intricate so mystical a manner as if they designed rather to conceal it from the vulgar than to explain it to common readers others speak admirably well with great clearness and strength on the necessity of selfdenial but then they deal in generals only without coming to particular instances and so are of little use to the bulk of mankind to men of ordinary capacity and education and if some of them do descend to particulars it is to those particulars only which do not affect the generality of men since they seldom if ever occur in common life  such as the enduring imprisonment or tortures the giving up in a literal sense their houses or lands their husbands or wives children or life itself to none of which we are called nor are likely to be unless god should permit times of public persecution to return in the meantime i know of no writer in the english tongue who has described the nature of selfdenial in plain and intelligible terms such as lie level   with common understandings and applied it to those little particulars which daily occur in common life a discourse of this kind is wanted still and it is wanted the more because in every stage of the spiritual life although there is a variety of particular hinderances of our attaining grace or growing therein yet are all resolvable into these general ones  either we do not deny ourselves or we do not take up our cross in order to supply this defect in some degree i shall endeavour to show first what it is for a man to deny himself and what to take up his cross and secondly that if a man be not fully christs disciple it is always owing to the want of this i 1 i shall first endeavour to show what it is for a man to deny himself and take up his cross daily this is a point which is of all others most necessary to be considered and throughly understood even on this account that it is of all others most opposed by numerous and powerful enemies all our nature must certainly rise up against this even in its own defence the world consequently the men who take nature not grace for their guide abhor the very sound of it and the great enemy of our souls well knowing its importance cannot but move every stone against it but this is not all even those who have in some measure shaken off the yoke of the devil who have experienced especially of late years a real work of grace in their hearts yet are no friends to this grand doctrine of christianity though it is so peculiarly insisted on by their master some of them are as deeply and totally ignorant concerning it as if there was not one word about it in the bible others are farther off still having unawares imbibed strong prejudices against it these they have received partly from outside christians men of a fair speech and behaviour who want nothing of godliness but the power nothing of religion but the spirit  and partly from those who did once if they do not now taste of the powers of the world to come but are there any of these who do not both practise selfdenial themselves and recommend it to others you are little acquainted with mankind if you doubt of this there are whole bodies of men who only do not declare war against it to go no farther than london look upon the whole body of predestinarians who by the free mercy of god have lately been called out of the darkness of nature into the light of faith are they patterns of selfdenial how few of them even profess to practise it at all how few of them recommend it themselves or are pleased with them that do rather do they not continually represent it in the most odious colours as if it were seeking salvation by works or seeking to establish our own righteousness and how readily do antinomians of all kinds from the smooth moravian to the boisterous foulmouthed ranter join the cry with their silly unmeaning cant of legality and preaching the law therefore you are in constant danger of being wheedled hectored or ridiculed out of this important gospeldoctrine either by false teachers or false brethren more or less beguiled from the simplicity of the gospel if you are not deeply grounded therein let fervent prayer then go before accompany and follow what you are now about to read that it may be written in your heart by the finger of god so as never to be erased but what is selfdenial wherein are we to deny ourselves and whence does the necessity of this arise i answer the will of god is the supreme unalterable rule for every intelligent creature equally binding every angel in heaven and every man upon earth nor can it be otherwise this is the natural necessary result of the relation between creatures and their creator but if the will of god be our one rule of action in every thing great and small it follows by undeniable consequence that we are not to do our own will in anything here therefore we see at once the nature with the ground and reason of selfdenial we see the nature of selfdenial it is the denying or refusing to follow ours own will from a conviction that the will of god is the only rule of action to us and we see the reason thereof because we are creatures because it is he that hath made us and not we ourselves this reason for selfdenial must hold even with regard to the angels of god in heaven and with regard to man innocent and holy as he came out of the hands of his creator but a farther reason for it arises from the condition wherein all men are since the fall we are all now shapen in wickedness and in sin did our mother conceive us our nature is altogether corrupt in every power and faculty and our will depraved equally with the rest is wholly bent to indulge our natural corruption on the other hand it is the will of god that we resist and counteract that corruption not at some times or in some things only but at all times and in all things here therefore is a farther ground for constant and universal selfdenial   4 to illustrate this a little further the will of god is a path leading straight to god the will of man which once ran parallel with it is now another path not only different from it but in our present state directly contrary to it it leads from god if therefore we walk in the one we must necessarily quit the other we cannot walk in both indeed a man of faint heart and feeble hands may go in two ways one after the other but he cannot walk in two ways at the same time he cannot at one and the same time follow his own will and follow the will of god he must choose the one or the other denying gods will to follow his own or denying himself to follow the will of god 5  now it is undoubtedly pleasing for the time to follow our own will by indulging in any instance that offers the corruption of our nature but by following it in anything we so far strengthen the perverseness of our will and by indulging it we continually increase the corruption of our nature so by the food which is agreeable to the palate we often increase a bodily disease it gratifies the taste but it inflames the disorder it brings pleasure but it also brings death on the whole then to deny ourselves is to deny our own will where it does not fall in with the will of god and that however pleasing it may be it is to deny ourselves any pleasure which does not spring from and lead to god that is in effect to refuse going out of our way though into a pleasant flowery path to refuse what we know to be deadly poison though agreeable to the taste and every one that would follow christ that would be his real disciple must not only deny himself but take up his cross also a cross is anything contrary to our will anything displeasing to our nature so that taking up our cross goes a little farther than denying ourselves it rises a little higher and is a more difficult task to flesh and blood  it being more easy to forego pleasure than to endure pain now in running the race which is set before us according to the will of god there is often a cross lying in the way that is something which is not only not joyous but grievous something which is contrary to our will which is displeasing to our nature what then is to be done the choice is plain either we must take up our cross or we must turn aside from the way of god from the holy commandment delivered to us if we do not stop altogether or turn back to everlasting perdition in order to the healing of that corruption that evil disease which every man brings with him into the world it is often needful to pluck out as it were a right eye to cut off a right hand  so painful is either the thing itself which must be done or the only means of doing it the parting suppose with a foolish desire with an inordinate affection or a separation from the object of it without which it can never be extinguished in the former kind the tearing away such a desire or affection when it is deeply rooted in the soul is often like the piercing of a sword yea like the dividing asunder of the soul and spirit the joints and marrow the lord then sits upon the soul as a refiners fire to burn all the dross thereof and this is a cross indeed it is essentially painful it must be so in the very nature of the thing the soul cannot be thus torn asunder it cannot pass through the fire without pain in the latter kind the means to heal a sinsick soul to cure a foolish desire an inordinate affection are often painful not in the nature of the thing but from the nature of the disease so when our lord said to the rich young man go sell that thou hast and give it to the poor as well knowing this was the only means of healing his covetousness the very thought of it gave him so much pain that he went away sorrowful choosing rather to part with his hope of heaven than his possessions on earth this was a burden he could not consent to lift a cross he would not take up and in the one kind or the other every follower of christ will surely have need to take up his cross daily the taking up differs a little from bearing his cross we are then properly said to bear our cross when we endure what is laid upon us without our choice with meekness and resignation whereas we do not properly take up our cross but when we voluntarily suffer what it is in our power to avoid when we willingly embrace the will of god though contrary to our own when we choose what is painful because it is the will of our wise and gracious creator and thus it behoves every disciple of christ to take up as well as to bear his cross indeed in one sense it is not his alone it is common to him and many others seeing there is no temptation befals any man ei me anthropinos  but such as is common to men such as is incident and adapted to their common nature and situation in the present world but in another sense as it is considered with all its circumstances it is his peculiar to himself it is prepared of god for him it is given by god to him as a token of his love and if he receives it as such and after using such means to remove the pressure as christian wisdom directs lies as clay in the potters hand it is disposed and ordered by god for his good both with regard to the quality of it and in respect to its quantity and degree its duration and every other circumstance in all this we may easily conceive our blessed lord to act as the physician of our souls not merely for his own pleasure but for our profit that we may be partakers of his holiness if in searching our wounds he puts us to pain it is only in order to heal them he cuts away what is putrified or unsound in order to preserve the sound part and if we freely choose the loss of a limb rather than the whole body should perish how much more should we choose figuratively to cut off a right hand rather than the whole soul should be cast into hell we see plainly then both the nature and ground of taking up our cross it does not imply the disciplining ourselves as some speak the literally tearing our own flesh the wearing haircloth or irongirdles or anything else that would impair our bodily health although we know not what allowance god may make for those who act thus through involuntary ignorance but the embracing the will of god though contrary to our own the choosing wholesome though bitter medicines the freely accepting temporary pain of whatever kind and in whatever degree when it is either essentially or accidentally necessary to eternal pleasure ii 1 i am secondly to show that it is always owing to the want either of selfdenial or taking up his cross that any man does not throughly follow him is not fully a disciple of christ it is true this may be partly owing in some cases to the want of the means of grace of hearing the true word of god spoken with power of the sacraments or of christian fellowship but where none of these is wanting the great hindrance of our receiving or growing in the grace of god is always the want of denying ourselves or taking up our cross a few instances will make this plain a man hears the word which is able to save his soul he is well pleased with what he hears acknowledges the truth and is a little affected by it yet he remains dead in trespasses and sins senseless and unawakened why is this because he will not part with his bosomsin though he now knows it is an abomination to the lord he came to hear full of lust and unholy desires and he will not part with them therefore no deep impression is made upon him but his foolish heart is still hardened that is he is still senseless and unawakened because he will not deny himself suppose he begins to awake out of sleep and his eyes are a little opened why are they so quickly closed again why does he again sink into the sleep of death because he again yields to his bosomsin he drinks again of the pleasing poison therefore it is impossible that any lasting impression should be made upon his heart that is he relapses into his fatal insensibility because he will not deny himself but this is not the case with all we have many instances of those who when once awakened sleep no more the impressions once received do not wear away they are not only deep but lasting and yet many of these have not found what they seek they mourn and yet are not comforted now why is this it is because they do not bring forth fruits meet for repentance because they do not according to the grace they have received cease from evil and do good they do not cease from the easily besetting sin the sin of their constitution of their education or of their profession or they omit doing the good they may and know they ought to do because of some disagreeable circumstance attending it that is they do not attain faith because they will not deny themselves or take up their cross  but this man did receive the heavenly gift he did taste of the powers of the world to come he saw the light of the glory of god in the face of jesus christ the peace which passeth all understanding did rule his heart and mind and the love of god was shed abroad therein by the holy ghost which was given unto him  yet he is now weak as another man he again relishes the   things of earth and has more taste for the things which are seen than for those which are not seen the eye of his understanding is closed again so that he cannot see him that is invisible his love is waxed cold and the peace of god no longer rules in his heart and no marvel for he has again given place to the devil and grieved the holy spirit of god he has turned again unto folly to some pleasing sin if not in outward act yet in heart he has given place to pride or anger or desire to selfwill or stubbornness or he did not stir up the gift of god which was in him he gave way to spiritual sloth and would not be at the pains of praying always and watching thereunto with all perseverance that is he made shipwreck of the faith for want of selfdenial and taking up his cross daily  but perhaps he has not made shipwreck of the faith he has still a measure of the spirit of adoption which continues to witness with his spirit that he is a child of god however he is not going on to perfection he is not as once hungering and thirsting after righteousness panting after the whole image and full enjoyment of god as the hart after the waterbrook rather he is weary and faint in his mind and as it were hovering between life and death and why is he thus but because he hath forgotten the word of god  by works is faith made perfect he does not use all diligence in working the works of god he does not continue instant in prayer private as well as public in communicating hearing meditation fasting and religious conference if he does not wholly neglect some of these means at least he does not use them all with his might or he is not zealous of works of charity as well as works of piety he is not merciful after his power with the full ability which god giveth he does not fervently serve the lord by doing good to men in every kind and in every degree he can to their souls as well as their bodies and why does he not continue in prayer because in time of dryness it is pain and grief unto him he does not continue in hearing at all opportunities because sleep is sweet or it is cold or dark or rainy but why does he not continue in works of mercy because he cannot feed the hungry or clothe the naked unless he retrench the expense of his own apparel or use cheaper and less pleasing food beside which the visiting the sick or those that are in prison is attended with many disagreeable circumstances and so are most works of spiritual mercy reproof in particular he would reprove his neighbour but sometimes shame sometimes fear comes between for he may expose himself not only to ridicule but to heavier inconveniences too upon these and the like considerations he omits one or more if not all works of mercy and piety therefore his faith is not made perfect neither can he grow in grace namely because he will not deny himself and take up his daily cross  it manifestly follows that it is always owing to the want either of selfdenial or taking up his cross that a man does not throughly follow his lord that he is not fully a disciple of christ it is owing to this that he who is dead in sin does not awake though the trumpet be blown that he who begins to awake out of sleep yet has no deep or lasting conviction that he who is deeply and lastingly convinced of sin does not attain remission of sins that some who have received this heavenly gift retain it not but make shipwreck of the faith and that others if they do not draw back to perdition yet are weary and faint in their mind and do not reach the mark of the prize of the high calling of god in christ jesus  iii 1 how easily may we learn hence that they know neither the scripture nor the power of god who directly or indirectly in public or in private oppose the doctrine of selfdenial and the daily cross how totally ignorant are these men of an hundred particular texts as well as of the general tenor of the whole oracles of god and how entirely unacquainted must they be with true genuine christian experience  of the manner wherein the holy spirit ever did and does at this day work in the souls of men they may talk indeed very loudly and confidently a natural fruit of ignorance as though they were the only men who understood either the word of god or the experience of his children but their words are in every sense vain words they are weighed in the balance and found wanting  2 we may learn from hence secondly the real cause why not only many particular persons but even bodies of men who were once burning and shining lights have now lost both their light and heat if they did not hate and oppose they at least lightly esteemed this precious gospel doctrine if they did not boldly say abnegationem omnem proculcamus internecioni damus we trample all selfdenial under foot we devote it to destruction yet they neither valued it according to its high importance nor took any pains in practising it hanc mystici docent said that great bad man the mystic writers teach selfdenial  no the inspired writers and god teaches it to every soul who is willing to hear his voice we may learn from hence thirdly that it is not enough for a minister of the gospel not to oppose the doctrine of selfdenial to say nothing concerning it nay he cannot satisfy his duty by saying a little in favour of it if he would indeed be pure from the blood of all men he must speak of it frequently and largely he must inculcate the necessity of it in the clearest and strongest manner he must press it with his might on all persons at all times and in all places laying line upon line line upon line precept upon precept precept upon precept so shall he have a conscience void of offence so shall he save his own soul and those that hear him lastly see that you apply this every one of you to your own soul meditate upon it when you are in secret ponder it in your heart take care not only to understand it throughly but to remember it to your lives end cry unto the strong for strength that you may no sooner understand than enter upon the practice of it delay not the time but practise it immediately from this very hour practise it universally on every one of the thousand occasions which will occur in all circumstances of life practise it daily without intermission from the hour you first set your hand to the plough and enduring therein to the end till your spirit returns to god   sermon 49 the cure of evilspeaking if thy brother shall sin against thee go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone if he shall hear thee thou hast gained thy brother but if he will not hear take with thee one or two more that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established and if he will not hear them tell it to the church but if he does not hear the church let him be to thee as an heathen man and a publican matt 181517 speak evil of no man says the great apostle  as plain a command as thou shalt do no murder but who even among christians regards this command yea how few are there that so much as understand it what is evilspeaking it is not as some suppose the same with lying or slandering all a man says may be as true as the bible and yet the saying of it is evilspeaking for evilspeaking is neither more nor less than speaking evil of an absent person relating something evil which was really done or said by one that is not present when it is related suppose having seen a man drunk or heard him curse or swear i tell this when he is absent it is evilspeaking in our language this is also by an extremely proper name termed backbiting nor is there any material difference between this and what we usually style talebearing if the tale be delivered in a soft and quiet manner perhaps with expressions of goodwill to the person and of hope that things may not be quite so bad then we call it whispering but in whatever manner it be done the thing is the same  the same in substance if not in circumstance still it is evilspeaking still this command speak evil of no man is trampled under foot if we relate to another the fault of a third person when he is not present to answer for himself and how extremely common is this sin among all orders and degrees of men how do high and low rich and poor wise and foolish learned and unlearned run into it continually persons who differ from each other in all things else nevertheless agree in this how few are there that can testify before god i am clear in this matter i have always set a watch before my mouth and kept the door of my lips what conversation do you hear of any considerable length whereof evilspeaking is not one ingredient and that even among persons who in the general have the fear of god before their eyes and do really desire to have a conscience void of offence toward god and toward man and the very commonness of this sin makes it difficult to be avoided as we are encompassed with it on every side so if we are not deeply sensible of the danger and continually guarding against it we are liable to be carried away by the torrent in this instance almost the whole of mankind is as it were in a conspiracy against us and their example steals upon us we know not how so that we insensibly slide into the imitation of it besides it is recommended from within as well as from without there is scarce any wrong temper in the mind of man which may not be occasionally gratified by it and consequently incline us to it it gratifies our pride to relate those faults of others whereof we think ourselves not to be guilty anger resentment and all unkind tempers are indulged by speaking against those with whom we are displeased and in many cases by reciting the sins of their neighbors men indulge their own foolish and hurtful desires evilspeaking is the more difficult to be avoided because it frequently attacks us in disguise we speak thus out of a noble generous it is well if we do not say holy indignation against these vile creatures we commit sin from mere hatred of sin we serve the devil out of pure zeal for god it is merely in order to punish the wicked that we run into this wickedness so do the passions as one speaks all justify themselves and palm sin upon us under the veil of holiness but is there no way to avoid the snare unquestionably there is our blessed lord has marked out a plain way for his followers in the words above recited none who warily and steadily walk in this path will ever fall into evilspeaking this rule is either an infallible preventive or a certain cure of it in the preceding verses our lord had said woe to the world because of offences  unspeakable misery will arise in the world from this baleful fountain offences are all things whereby anyone is turned out of or hindered in the ways of god for it must be that offenses come  such is the nature of things such the wickedness folly and weakness of mankind but woe to that man    miserable is that man by whom the offense cometh wherefore if thy hand thy foot thine eye cause thee to offend  if the most dear enjoyment the most beloved and useful person turn thee out of or hinder thee in the way pluck it out  cut them off and cast them from thee but how can we avoid giving offense to some and being offended at others especially suppose they are quite in the wrong and we see it with our own eyes our lord here teaches us how he lays down a sure method of avoiding offenses and evilspeaking together if thy brother shall sin against thee go and tell him of his fault between thee and him alone if he will hear thee thou hast gained thy brother but if he will not hear thee take with thee one or two more that by the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established and if he will not hear them tell it to the church but if he will not hear the church let him be to thee as an heathen man and a publican i 1 first if thy brother shall sin against thee go and tell him of his fault between thee and him alone the most literal way of following this first rule where it is practicable is the best therefore if thou seest with thine own eyes a brother a fellow christian commit undeniable sin or hearest it with thine own ears so that it is impossible for thee to doubt the fact then thy part is plain take the very first opportunity of going to him and if thou canst have access tell him of his fault between thee and him alone indeed great care is to be taken that this is done in a right spirit and in a right manner the success of a reproof greatly depends on the spirit wherein it is given be not therefore wanting in earnest prayer to god that it may be given in a lowly spirit with a deep piercing conviction that it is god alone who maketh thee to differ and that if any good be done by what is now spoken god doeth it himself pray that he would guard thy heart enlighten thy mind and direct thy tongue to such words as he may please to bless see that thou speak in a meek as well as a lowly spirit for the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of god if he be overtaken in a fault he can no otherwise be restored than in the spirit of meekness if he opposes the truth yet he cannot be brought to the knowledge thereof but by gentleness still speak in a spirit of tender love which many waters cannot quench if love is not conquered it conquers all things who can tell the force of love  love can bow down the stubborn neck the stone to flesh convert soften and melt and pierce and break an adamantine heart confirm then your love toward him and you will thereby heap coals of fire upon his head but see that the manner also wherein you speak be according to the gospel of christ avoid everything in look gesture word and tone of voice that savors of pride or selfsufficiency studiously avoid everything magisterial or dogmatical everything that looks like arrogance or assuming beware of the most distant approach to disdain overbearing or contempt with equal care avoid all appearance of anger and though you use great plainness of speech yet let there be no reproach no railing accusation no token of any warmth but that of love above all let there be no shadow of hate or illwill no bitterness or sourness of expression but use the air and language of sweetness as well as gentleness that all may appear to flow from love in the heart and yet this sweetness need not hinder your speaking in the most serious and solemn manner as far as may be in the very words of the oracles of god for there are none like them and as under the eye of him who is coming to judge the quick and dead  if you have not an opportunity of speaking to him in person or cannot have access you may do it by a messenger by a common friend in whose prudence as well as uprightness you can thoroughly confide such a person speaking in your name and in the spirit and manner above described may answer the same end and in a good degree supply your lack of service only beware you do not feign the want of opportunity in order to shun the cross neither take it for granted that you cannot have access without ever making the trial whenever you can speak in your own person it is far better but you should rather do it by another than not at all this way is better than none   but what if you can neither speak yourself nor find such a messenger as you can confide in if this is really the case it then only remains to write and there may be some circumstances which make this the most advisable way of speaking one of these circumstances is when the person with whom we have to do is of so warm and impetuous a temper as does not easily bear reproof especially from an equal or inferior but it may be so introduced and softened in writing as to make it far more tolerable besides many will read the very same words which they could not bear to hear it does not give so violent a shock to their pride nor so sensibly touch their honor and suppose it makes little impression at first they will perhaps give it a second reading and upon farther consideration lay to heart what before they disregarded if you add your name this is nearly the same thing as going to him and speaking in person and this should always be done unless it be rendered improper by some very particular reason  it should be well observed not only that this is a step which our lord absolutely commands us to take but that he commands us to take this step first before we attempt any other no alternative is allowed no choice of anything else this is the way walk thou in it it is true he enjoins us if need require to take two other steps but they are to be taken successively after this step and neither of them before it much less are we to take any other step either before or beside this to do anything else or not to do this is therefore equally inexcusable do not think to excuse yourself for taking an entirely different step by saying why i did not speak to anyone till i was so burdened that i could not refrain you was burdened it was no wonder you should unless your conscience was seared for you was under the guilt of sin of disobeying a plain commandment of god you ought immediately to have gone and told your brother of his fault between you and him alone if you did not how should you be other than burdened unless your heart was utterly hardened while you was trampling the command of god under foot and hating your brother in your heart and what a way have you found to unburden yourself god reproves you for a sin of omission for not telling your brother of his fault and you comfort yourself under his reproof by a sin of commission by telling your brothers fault to another person ease bought by sin is a dear purchase i trust in god you will have no ease but will be burdened so much the more till you go to your brother and tell him and no one else i know but of one exception to this rule there may be a peculiar case wherein it is necessary to accuse the guilty though absent in order to preserve the innocent for instance you are acquainted with the design which a man has against the property or life of his neighbor now the case may be so circumstanced that there is no other way of hindering that design from taking effect but the making it known without delay to him against whom it is laid in this case therefore this rule is set aside as is that of the apostle speak evil of no man and it is lawful yea it is our bounden duty to speak evil of an absent person in order to prevent his doing evil to others and himself at the same time but remember meanwhile that all evilspeaking is in its own nature deadly poison therefore if you are sometimes constrained to use it as a medicine yet use it with fear and trembling seeing it is so dangerous a medicine that nothing but absolute necessity can excuse your using it at all accordingly use it as seldom as possible never but when there is such a necessity and even then use as little of it as is possible only so much as is necessary for the end proposed at all other times go and tell him of his fault between thee and him alone ii 1 but what if he will not hear if he repay evil for good if he be enraged rather than convinced what if he hear to no purpose and go on still in the evil of his way we must expect this will frequently be the case the mildest and tenderest reproof will have no effect but the blessing we wished for another will return into our own bosom and what are we to do then our lord has given us a clear and full direction then take with thee one or two more this is the second step take one or two whom you know to be of a loving spirit lovers of god and of their neighbor see likewise that they be of a lowly spirit and clothed with humility let them also be such as are meek and gentle patient and longsuffering not apt to return evil for evil or railing for railing but contrariwise blessing let them be men of understanding such as are endued with wisdom from above and men unbiased free from partiality free from prejudice of any kind care should likewise be taken that both the persons and their characters be well known to him and let those that are acceptable to him be chosen preferable to any others   love will dictate the manner wherein they should proceed according to the nature of the case nor can any one particular manner be prescribed for all cases but perhaps in general one might advise before they enter upon the thing itself let them mildly and affectionately declare that they have no anger or prejudice toward him and that it is merely from a principle of goodwill that they now come or at all concern themselves with his affairs to make this the more apparent they might then calmly attend to your repetition of your former conversation with him and to what he said in his own defense before they attempted to determine anything after this they would be better able to judge in what manner to proceed that by the mouth of two or three witnesses every word might be established that whatever you have said may have its full force by the additional weight of their authority  in order to this may they not 1 briefly repeat what you spoke and what he answered 2 enlarge upon open and confirm the reasons which you had given 3 give weight to your reproof showing how just how kind and how seasonable it was and lastly enforce the advices and persuasions which you had annexed to it and these may likewise hereafter if need should require bear witness of what was spoken with regard to this as well as the preceding rule we may observe that our lord gives us no choice leaves us no alternative but expressly commands us to do this and nothing else in the place of it he likewise directs us when to do this neither sooner nor later namely after we have taken the first and before we have taken the third step it is then only that we are authorized to relate the evil another has done to those whom we desire to bear a part with us in this great instance of brotherly love but let us have a care how we relate it to any other person till both these steps have been taken if we neglect to take these or if we take any others what wonder if we are burdened still for we are sinners against god and against our neighbor and how fairly soever we may color it yet if we have any conscience our sin will find us out and bring a burden upon our soul iii 1 that we may be thoroughly instructed in this weighty affair our lord has given us a still farther direction if he will not hear them then and not till then tell it to the church this is the third step all the question is how this word the church is here to be understood but the very nature of the thing will determine this beyond all reasonable doubt you cannot tell it to the national church the whole body of men termed the church of england neither would it answer any christian end if you could this therefore is not the meaning of the word neither can you tell it to that whole body of people in england with whom you have a more immediate connection nor indeed would this answer any good end the word therefore is not to be understood thus it would not answer any valuable end to tell the faults of every particular member to the church if you would so term it the congregation or society united together in london it remains that you tell it to the elder or elders of the church to those who are overseers of that flock of christ to which you both belong who watch over yours and his soul as they that must give account and this should be done if it conveniently can in the presence of the person concerned and though plainly yet with all the tenderness and love which the nature of the thing will admit it properly belongs to their office to determine concerning the behavior of those under their care and to rebuke according to the demerit of the offense with all authority when therefore you have done this you have done all which the word of god or the law of love requireth of you you are not now partaker of his sin but if he perish his blood is on his own head here also let it be observed that this and no other is the third step which we are to take and that we are to take it in its order after the other two not before the second much less the first unless in some very particular circumstance indeed in one case the second step may coincide with this they may be in a manner one and the same the elder or elders of the church may be so connected with the offending brother that they may set aside the necessity and supply the place of the one or two witnesses so that it may suffice to tell it to them after you have told it to your brother between you and him alone when you have done this you have delivered your own soul if he will not hear the church if he persist in his sin let him be to thee as an heathen man and a publican you are under no obligation to think of him any more only when you commend him to god in prayer you need not speak of him any more but leave him to his own master indeed you still owe to him as to all other heathens earnest tender goodwill you owe him courtesy and as occasion offers all the offices of humanity but have no friendship no familiarity with him no other intercourse than with an open heathen but if this be the rule by which christians walk which is the land where christians live a few you may possibly find scattered up and down who make a conscience of observing it but how very few how thinly scattered upon the face of the earth and where is there any body of men that universally walk thereby can we find them in europe or to go no farther in great britain or ireland i fear not i fear we may search these kingdoms throughout and yet search in vain alas for the christian world alas for protestants for reformed christians o who will rise up with me against the wicked who will take gods part against the evilspeakers art thou the man by the grace of god wilt thou be one who art not carried away by the torrent art thou fully determined god being thy helper from this very hour to set a watch a continual watch before thy mouth and keep the door of thy lips from this hour wilt thou walk by this rule speaking evil of no man if thou seest thy brother do evil wilt thou tell him of his fault between thee and him alone afterwards take one or two witnesses and then only tell it to the church if this be the full purpose of thy heart then learn one lesson well hear evil of no man if there were no hearers there would be no speakers of evil and is not according to the vulgar proverb the receiver as bad as the thief if then any begin to speak evil in thy hearing check him immediately refuse to hear the voice of the charmer charm he never so sweetly let him use ever so soft a manner so mild an accent ever so many professions of goodwill for him whom he is stabbing in the dark whom he smiteth under the fifth rib resolutely refuse to hear though the whisperer complain of being burdened till he speak burdened thou fool dost thou travail with thy cursed secret as a woman travaileth with child go then and be delivered of thy burden in the way the lord hath ordained first go and tell thy brother of his fault between thee and him alone next take with thee one or two common friends and tell him in their presence if neither of these steps take effect then tell it to the church but at the peril of thy soul tell it to no one else either before or after unless in that one exempt case when it is absolutely needful to preserve the innocent why shouldst thou burden another as well as thyself by making him partaker of thy sin o that all you who bear the reproach of christ who are in derision called methodists would set an example to the christian world so called at least in this one instance put ye away evilspeaking talebearing whispering let none of them proceed out of your mouth see that you speak evil of no man of the absent nothing but good if ye must be distinguished whether ye will or no let this be the distinguishing mark of a methodist he censures no man behind his back by this fruit ye may know him what a blessed effect of this selfdenial should we quickly feel in our hearts how would our peace flow as a river when we thus followed peace with all men how would the love of god abound in our own souls while we thus confirmed our love to our brethren and what an effect would it have on all that were united together in the name of the lord jesus how would brotherly love continually increase when this grand hindrance of it was removed all the members of christs mystical body would then naturally care for each other if one member suffered all would suffer with it if one was honored all would rejoice with it and everyone would love his brother with a pure heart fervently nor is this all but what an effect might this have even on the wild unthinking world how soon would they descry in us what they could not find among all the thousands of their brethren and cry as julian the apostate to his heathen courtiers see how these christians love one another by this chiefly would god convince the world and prepare them also for his kingdom as we may easily learn from those remarkable words in our lords last solemn prayer i pray for them who will believe in me that they all may be one as thou father art in me and i in thee that the world may believe that thou hast sent me john 1721 the lord hasten the time the lord enable us thus to love one another not only in word and in tongue but in deed and in truth even as christ hath loved us   sermon 50 text from the 1872 edition the use of money i say unto you make unto yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness that when ye fail they may receive you into the everlasting habitations luke 169 our lord having finished the beautiful parable of the prodigal son which he had particularly addressed to those who murmured at his receiving publicans and sinners adds another relation of a different kind addressed rather to the children of god he said unto his disciples not so much to the scribes and pharisees to whom he had been speaking before  there was a certain rich man who had a steward and he was accused to him of wasting his goods and calling him he said give an account of thy stewardship for thou canst be no longer steward luke 161 2 after reciting the method which the bad steward used to provide against the day of necessity our saviour adds his lord commended the unjust steward namely in this respect that he used timely precaution and subjoins this weighty reflection the children of this world are wiser in their generation than the children of light luke 168 those who seek no other portion than this world are wiser not absolutely for they are one and all the veriest fools the most egregious madmen under heaven but in their generation in their own way they are more consistent with themselves they are truer to their acknowledged principles they more steadily pursue their end than the children of light  than they who see the light of the glory of god in the face of jesus christ then follow the words above recited and i  the onlybegotten son of god the creator lord and possessor of heaven and earth and all that is therein the judge of all to whom ye are to give an account of your stewardship when ye can be no longer stewards i say unto you  learn in this respect even of the unjust steward  make yourselves friends by wise timely precaution of the mammon of unrighteousness mammon means riches or money it is termed the mammon of unrighteousness because of the unrighteous manner wherein it frequently procured and wherein even that which was honestly procured is generally employed make yourselves friends of this by doing all possible good particularly to the children of god that when ye fail  when ye return to dust when ye have no more place under the sun  those of them who are gone before may receive you may welcome you into the everlasting habitations an excellent branch of christian wisdom is here inculcated by our lord on all his followers namely the right use of money  a subject largely spoken of after their manner by men of the world but not sufficiently considered by those whom god hath chosen out of the world these generally do not consider as the importance of the subject requires the use of this excellent talent neither do they understand how to employ it to the greatest advantage the introduction of which into the world is one admirable instance of the wise and gracious providence of god it has indeed been the manner of poets orators and philosophers in almost all ages and nations to rail at this as the grand corrupter of the world the bane of virtue the pest of human society hence nothing so commonly heard as nocens ferrum ferroque nocentius aurum and gold more mischievous than keenest steel hence the lamentable complaint effodiuntur opes irritamenta malorum wealth is dug up incentive to all ill nay one celebrated writer gravely exhorts his countrymen in order to banish all vice at once to  throw all their money into the sea    in mare proximum    summi materiem mali but is not all this mere empty rant is there any solid reason therein by no means for let the world be as corrupt as it will is gold or silver to blame the love of money we know is the root of all evil but not the thing itself the fault does not lie in the money but in them that use it it may be used ill and what may not but it may likewise be used well it is full as applicable to the best as to the worst uses it is of unspeakable service to all civilized nations in all the common affairs of life it is a most compendious instrument of transacting all manner of business and if we use it according to christian wisdom of doing all manner of good it is true were man in a state of innocence or were all men filled with the holy ghost so that like the infant church at jerusalem no man counted anything he had his own but distribution was made to everyone as he had need the use of it would be superseded as we cannot conceive there is anything of the kind among the inhabitants of heaven but in the present state of mankind it is an excellent gift of god answering the noblest ends in the hands of his children it is food for the hungry drink for the thirsty raiment for the naked it gives to the traveller and the stranger where to lay his head by it we may supply the place of an husband to the widow and of a father to the fatherless we maybe a defence for the oppressed a means of health to the sick of ease to them that are in pain it may be as eyes to the blind as feet to the lame yea a lifter up from the gates of death 3 it is therefore of the highest concern that all who fear god know how to employ this valuable talent that they be instructed how it may answer these glorious ends and in the highest degree and perhaps all the instructions which are necessary for this may be reduced to three plain rules by the exact observance whereof we may approve ourselves faithful stewards of the mammon of unrighteousness i 1 the first of these is he that heareth let him understand gain all you can here we may speak like the children of the world we meet them on their own ground and it is our bounden duty to do this we ought to gain all we can gain without buying gold too dear without paying more for it than it is worth but this it is certain we ought not to do we ought not to gain money at the expense of life nor which is in effect the same thing at the expense of our health therefore no gain whatsoever should induce us to enter into or to continue in any employ which is of such a kind or is attended with so hard or so long labour as to impair our constitution neither should we begin or continue in any business which necessarily deprives us of proper seasons for food and sleep in such a proportion as our nature requires indeed there is a great difference here some employments are absolutely and totally unhealthy as those which imply the dealing much with arsenic or other equally hurtful minerals or the breathing an air tainted with steams of melting lead which must at length destroy the firmest constitution others may not be absolutely unhealthy but only to persons of a weak constitution such are those which require many hours to be spent in writing especially if a person write sitting and lean upon his stomach or remain long in an uneasy posture but whatever it is which reason or experience shows to be destructive of health or strength that we may not submit to seeing the life is more valuable than meat and the body than raiment and if we are already engaged in such an employ we should exchange it as soon as possible for some which if it lessen our gain will however not lessen our health 2 we are secondly to gain all we can without hurting our mind any more than our body for neither may we hurt this we must preserve at all events the spirit of an healthful mind therefore we may not engage or continue in any sinful trade any that is contrary to the law of god or of our country such are all that necessarily imply our robbing or defrauding the king of his lawful customs for it is at least as sinful to defraud the king of his right as to rob our fellow subjects and the king has full as much right to his customs as we have to our houses and apparel other businesses there are which however innocent in themselves cannot be followed with innocence now at least not in england such for instance as will not afford a competent maintenance without cheating or lying or conformity to some custom which not consistent with a good conscience these likewise are sacredly to be avoided whatever gain they may be attended with provided we follow the custom of the trade for to gain money we must not lose our souls there are yet others which many pursue with perfect innocence without hurting either their body or mind and yet perhaps you cannot either they may entangle you in that company which would destroy your soul and by repeated experiments it may appear that you cannot separate the one from the other or there may be an idiosyncrasy  a peculiarity in your constitution of soul as there is in the bodily constitution of many by reason whereof that employment is deadly to you which another may safely follow so i am convinced from many experiments i could not study to any degree of perfection either mathematics arithmetic or algebra without being a deist if not an atheist and yet others may study them all their lives without sustaining any inconvenience none therefore can here determine for another but every man must judge for himself and abstain from whatever he in particular finds to be hurtful to his soul we are thirdly to gain all we can without hurting our neighbour but this we may not cannot do if we love our neighbour as ourselves we cannot if we love everyone as ourselves hurt anyone in his substance we cannot devour the increase of his lands and perhaps the lands and houses themselves by gaming by overgrown bills whether on account of physic or law or anything else or by requiring or taking such interest as even the laws of our country forbid hereby all pawnbroking is excluded seeing whatever good we might do thereby all unprejudiced men see with grief to be abundantly overbalanced by the evil and if it were otherwise yet we are not allowed to do evil that good may come we cannot consistent with brotherly love sell our goods below the market price we cannot study to ruin our neighbours trade in order to advance our own much less can we entice away or receive any of his servants or workmen whom he has need of none can gain by swallowing up his neighbours substance without gaining the damnation of hell neither may we gain by hurting our neighbour in his body therefore we may not sell anything which tends to impair health such is eminently all that liquid fire commonly called drams or spirituous liquors it is true these may have a place in medicine they may be of use in some bodily disorders although there would rarely be occasion for them were it not for the unskillfulness of the practitioner therefore such as prepare and sell them only for this end may keep their conscience clear but who are they who prepare and sell them only for this end do you know ten such distillers in england then excuse these but all who sell them in the common way to any that will buy are poisoners general they murder his majestys subjects by wholesale neither does their eye pity or spare they drive them to hell like sheep and what is their gain is it not the blood of these men who then would envy their large estates and sumptuous palaces a curse is in the midst of them the curse of god cleaves to the stones the timber the furniture of them the curse of god is in their gardens their walks their groves a fire that burns to the nethermost hell blood blood is there the foundation the floor the walls the roof are stained with blood and canst thou hope o thou man of blood though thou art clothed in scarlet and fine linen and farest sumptuously every day canst thou hope to deliver down thy fields of blood to the third generation not so for there is a god in heaven therefore thy name shall soon be rooted out like as those whom thou hast destroyed body and soul thy memorial shall perish with thee and are not they partakers of the same guilt though in a lower degree whether surgeons apothecaries or physicians who play with the lives or health of men to enlarge their own gain who purposely lengthen the pain or disease which they are able to remove speedily who protract the cure of their patients body in order to plunder his substance can any man be clear before god who does not shorten every disorder as much as he can and remove all sickness and pain as soon as he can he cannot for nothing can be more clear than that he does not love his neighbour as himself than that he does not do unto others as he would they should do unto himself this is dearbought gain and so is whatever is procured by hurting our neighbour in his soul by ministering suppose either directly or indirectly to his unchastity or intemperance which certainly none can do who has any fear of god or any real desire of pleasing him it nearly concerns all those to consider this who have anything to do with taverns victuallinghouses operahouses playhouses or any other places of public fashionable diversion if these profit the souls of men you are clear your employment is good and your gain innocent but if they are either sinful in themselves or natural inlets to sin of various kinds then it is to be feared you have a sad account to make o beware lest god say in that day these have perished in their iniquity but their blood do i require at thy hands these cautions and restrictions being observed it is the bounden duty of all who are engaged in worldly business to observe that first and great rule of christian wisdom with respect to money gain all you can gain all you can by honest industry use all possible diligence in your calling lose no time if you understand yourself and your relation to god and man you know you have none to spare if you understand your particular calling as you ought you will have no time that hangs upon your hands every business will afford some employment sufficient for every day and every hour that wherein you are placed if you follow it in earnest will leave you no leisure for silly unprofitable diversions you have always something better to do something that will profit you more or less and whatsoever thy hand findeth to do do it with thy might do it as soon as possible no delay no putting off from day to day or from hour to hour never leave anything till tomorrow which you can do today and do it as well as possible do not sleep or yawn over it put your whole strength to the work spare no pains let nothing be done by halves or in a slight and careless manner let nothing in your business be left undone if it can be done by labour or patience 8 gain all you can by common sense by using in your business all the understanding which god has given you it is amazing to observe how few do this how men run on in the same dull track with their forefathers but whatever they do who know not god this is no rule for you it is a shame for a christian not to improve upon them in whatever he takes in hand you should be continually learning from the experience of others or from your own experience reading and reflection to do everything you have to do better today than you did yesterday and see that you practise whatever you learn that you may make the best of all that is in your hands ii 1 having gained all you can by honest wisdom and unwearied diligence the second rule of christian prudence is save all you can do not throw the precious talent into the sea leave that folly to heathen philosophers do not throw it away in idle expenses which is just the same as throwing it into the sea expend no part of it merely to gratify the desire of the flesh the desire of the eye or the pride of life do not waste any part of so precious a talent merely in gratifying the desires of the flesh in procuring the pleasures of sense of whatever kind particularly in enlarging the pleasure of tasting i do not mean avoid gluttony and drunkenness only an honest heathen would condemn these but there is a regular reputable kind of sensuality an elegant epicurism which does not immediately disorder the stomach nor sensibly at least impair the understanding and yet to mention no other effects of it now it cannot be maintained without considerable expense cut off all this expense despise delicacy and variety and be content with what plain nature requires do not waste any part of so precious a talent merely in gratifying the desire of the eye by superfluous or expensive apparel or by needless ornaments waste no part of it in curiously adorning your houses in superfluous or expensive furniture in costly pictures painting gilding books in elegant rather than useful gardens let your neighbours who know nothing better do this let the dead bury their dead but what is that to thee says our lord follow thou me are you willing then you are able so to do lay out nothing to gratify the pride of life to gain the admiration or praise of men this motive of expense is frequently interwoven with one or both of the former men are expensive in diet or apparel or furniture not barely to please their appetite or to gratify their eye their imagination but their vanity too so long as thou dost well unto thyself men will speak good of thee so long as thou art clothed in purple and fine linen and farest sumptuously every day no doubt many will applaud thy elegance of taste thy generosity and hospitality but do not buy their applause so dear rather be content with the honour that cometh from god who would expend anything in gratifying these desires if he considered that to gratify them is to increase them nothing can be more certain than this daily experience shows the more they are indulged they increase the more whenever therefore you expend anything to please your taste or other senses you pay so much for sensuality when you lay out money to please your eye you give so much for an increase of curiosity  for a stronger attachment to these pleasures which perish in the using while you are purchasing anything which men use to applaud you are purchasing more vanity had you not then enough of vanity sensuality curiosity before was there need of any addition and would you pay for it too what manner of wisdom is this would not the literally throwing your money into the sea be a less mischievous folly   and why should you throw away money upon your children any more than upon yourself in delicate food in gay or costly apparel in superfluities of any kind why should you purchase for them more pride or lust more vanity or foolish and hurtful desires they do not want any more they have enough already nature has made ample provision for them why should you be at farther expense to increase their temptations and snares and to pierce them through with more sorrows do not leave it to them to throw away if you have good reason to believe that they would waste what is now in your possession in gratifying and thereby increasing the desire of the flesh the desire of the eye or the pride of life at the peril of theirs and your own soul do not set these traps in their way do not offer your sons or your daughters unto belial any more than unto moloch have pity upon them and remove out of their way what you may easily foresee would increase their sins and consequently plunge them deeper into everlasting perdition how amazing then is the infatuation of those parents who think they can never leave their children enough what cannot you leave them enough of arrows firebrands and death not enough of foolish and hurtful desires not enough of pride lust ambition vanity not enough of everlasting burnings poor wretch thou fearest where no fear is surely both thou and they when ye are lifting up your eyes in hell will have enough both of the worm that never dieth and of the fire that never shall be quenched what then would you do if you was in my case if you had a considerable fortune to leave whether i would do it or no i know what i ought to do this will admit of no reasonable question if i had one child elder or younger who knew the value of money one who i believed would put it to the true use i should think it my absolute indispensable duty to leave that child the bulk of my fortune and to the rest just so much as would enable them to live in the manner they had been accustomed to do but what if all your children were equally ignorant of the true use of money i ought then hard saying who can hear it to give each what would keep him above want and to bestow all the rest in such a manner as i judged would be most for the glory of god iii 1 but let not any man imagine that he has done anything barely by going thus far by gaining and saving all he can if he were to stop here all this is nothing if a man go not forward if he does not point all this at a farther end nor indeed can a man properly be said to save anything if he only lays it up you may as well throw your money into the sea as bury it in the earth and you may as well bury it in the earth as in your chest or in the bank of england not to use is effectually to throw it away if therefore you would indeed make yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness add the third rule to the two preceding having first gained all you can and secondly saved all you can then give all you can in order to see the ground and reason of this consider when the possessor of heaven and earth brought you into being and placed you in this world he placed you here not as a proprietor but a steward as such he entrusted you for a season with goods of various kinds but the sole property of these still rests in him nor can be alienated from him as you yourself are not your own but his such is likewise all that you enjoy such is your soul and your body not your own but gods and so is your substance in particular and he has told you in the most clear and express terms how you are to employ it for him in such a manner that it may be all an holy sacrifice acceptable through christ jesus and this light easy service he has promised to reward with an eternal weight of glory the directions which god has given us touching the use of our worldly substance may be comprised in the following particulars if you desire to be a faithful and a wise steward out of that portion of your lords goods which he has for the present lodged in your hands but with the right of resuming whenever it pleases him first provide things needful for yourself food to eat raiment to put on whatever nature moderately requires for preserving the body in health and strength secondly provide these for your wife your children your servants or any others who pertain to your household if when this is done there be an overplus left then do good to them that are of the household of faith if there be an overplus still as you have opportunity do good unto all men in so doing you give all you can nay in a sound sense all you have for all that is laid out in this manner is really given to god you render unto god the things that are gods not only by what you give to the poor but also by that which you expend in providing things needful for yourself and your household   if then a doubt should at any time arise in your mind concerning what you are going to expend either on yourself or any part of your family you have an easy way to remove it calmly and seriously inquire 1 in expending this am i acting according to my character am i acting herein not as a proprietor but as a steward of my lords goods 2 am i doing this in obedience to his word in what scripture does he require me so to do 3 can i offer up this action this expense as a sacrifice to god through jesus christ 4 have i reason to believe that for this very work i shall have a reward at the resurrection of the just you will seldom need anything more to remove any doubt which arises on this head but by this fourfold consideration you will receive clear light as to the way wherein you should go if any doubt still remain you may farther examine yourself by prayer according to those heads of inquiry try whether you can say to the searcher of hearts your conscience not condemning you lord thou seest i am going to expend this sum on that food apparel furniture and thou knowest i act herein with a single eye as a steward of thy goods expending this portion of them thus in pursuance of the design thou hadst in entrusting me with them thou knowest i do this in obedience to the lord as thou commandest and because thou commandest it let this i beseech thee be an holy sacrifice acceptable through jesus christ and give me a witness in myself that for this labour of love i shall have a recompense when thou rewardest every man according to his works now if your conscience bear you witness in the holy ghost that this prayer is wellpleasing to god then have you no reason to doubt but that expense is right and good and such as will never make you ashamed you see then what it is to make yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness and by what means you may procure that when ye fail they may receive you into the everlasting habitations you see the nature and extent of truly christian prudence so far as it relates to the use of that great talent money gain all you can without hurting either yourself or your neighbour in soul or body by applying hereto with unintermitted diligence and with all the understanding which god has given you  save all you can by cutting off every expense which serves only to indulge foolish desire to gratify either the desire of flesh the desire of the eye or the pride of life waste nothing living or dying on sin or folly whether for yourself or your children  and then give all you can or in other words give all you have to god do not stint yourself like a jew rather than a christian to this or that proportion render unto god not a tenth not a third not half but all that is gods be it more or less by employing all on yourself your household the household of faith and all mankind in such a manner that you may give a good account of your stewardship when ye can be no longer stewards in such a manner as the oracles of god direct both by general and particular precepts in such a manner that whatever ye do may be a sacrifice of a sweetsmelling savour to god and that every act may be rewarded in that day when the lord cometh with all his saints brethren can we be either wise or faithful stewards unless we thus manage our lords goods we cannot as not only the oracles of god but our own conscience beareth witness then why should we delay why should we confer any longer with flesh and blood or men of the world our kingdom our wisdom is not of this world heathen custom is nothing to us we follow no men any farther than they are followers of christ hear ye him yea today while it is called today hear and obey his voice at this hour and from this hour do his will fulfil his word in this and in all things i entreat you in the name of the lord jesus act up to the dignity of your calling no more sloth whatsoever your hand findeth to do do it with your might no more waste cut off every expense which fashion caprice or flesh and blood demand no more covetousness but employ whatever god has entrusted you with in doing good all possible good in every possible kind and degree to the household of faith to all men this is no small part of the wisdom of the just give all ye have as well as all ye are a spiritual sacrifice to him who withheld not from you his son his only son so laying up in store for yourselves a good foundation against the time to come that ye may attain eternal life
