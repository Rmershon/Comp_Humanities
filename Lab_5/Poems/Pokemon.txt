I want to be the very best,
Like no one ever was.
To catch them is my real test,
To train them is my cause.

I will travel across the land,
Searching far and wide.
Each Pokemon to understand
The power that's inside

(Gotta catch 'em all)
It's you and me
I know it's my destiny
Pokemon!
You're my best friend
In a world we must defend
Pokemon
(Gotta catch 'em all)
A heart so true
Our courage will pull us through
You teach me and I'll teach you
Pokemon
(Gotta catch 'em all)

every challenge along the way
with courage i will face
i will battle everyday
to claim my rightful place
come with me the time is right
theres no better team
arm and arm well win the fight
its always been our dream
Pokemon



(Gotta catch 'em all)

i know its my destiny
Pokemon
Oh, your my best friend
